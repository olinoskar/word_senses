"the scene was the hall of capulet 's house , and romeo in his pilgrim 's dress had entered with mercutio and his other friends . the band , such as it was , struck up a few bars of music , and the dance began . through the crowd of ungainly , shabbily dressed actors , sibyl vane moved like a creature from a finer world . her body swayed , while she danced , as a plant sways in the water . the curves of her throat were the curves of a white lily . her hands seemed to be made of cool ivory .",78

"she had a turn for traffic , and a marked propensity for saving ; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens , but also in driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower - roots , seeds , and slips of plants ; that functionary having orders from mrs . reed to buy of his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell : and eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a handsome profit thereby .",44

"this tree is distinguished from other trees by a straight trunk forty feet high . to the naturalist 's eye , its gracefully rounded crown , formed of big multilobed leaves , was enough to denote the artocarpus that has been so successfully transplanted to the mascarene islands east of madagascar . from its mass of greenery , huge globular fruit stood out , a decimeter wide and furnished on the outside with creases that assumed a hexangular pattern . it 's a handy plant that nature gives to regions lacking in wheat ; without needing to be cultivated , it bears fruit eight months out of the year .",84
"but i could n't linger . captain nemo , on familiar terms with these dreadful animals , no longer minded them . we arrived at a preliminary plateau where still other surprises were waiting for me . there picturesque ruins took shape , betraying the hand of man , not our creator . they were huge stacks of stones in which you could distinguish the indistinct forms of palaces and temples , now arrayed in hosts of blossoming zoophytes , and over it all , not ivy but a heavy mantle of algae and fucus plants .",95
"in the midst of this moving vegetation , under arbors of water plants , there raced legions of clumsy articulates , in particular some fanged frog crabs whose carapaces form a slightly rounded triangle , robber crabs exclusive to these waterways , and horrible parthenope crabs whose appearance was repulsive to the eye . one animal no less hideous , which i encountered several times , was the enormous crab that mr . darwin observed , to which nature has given the instinct and requisite strength to eat coconuts ; it scrambles up trees on the beach and sends the coconuts tumbling ; they fracture in their fall and are opened by its powerful pincers . here , under these clear waves , this crab raced around with matchless agility , while green turtles from the species frequenting the malabar coast moved sluggishly among the crumbling rocks .",12
"on this day , the engineer , seeing a plant belonging to the wormwood genus , the principal species of which are absinthe , balm - mint , tarragon , etc . , gathered several tufts , and , presenting them to the sailor , said,--",9
"the bank was raised a little above the level of the sea , and on this luxuriant soil , supported by a granite base , the fine forest trees seemed to be as firmly planted as in the interior of the island .",34
"but when we had ascended to an elevation of about 250 feet , we were stopped by insurmountable obstacles . the converging inside walls changed into overhangs , and our climb into a circular stroll . at this topmost level the vegetable kingdom began to challenge the mineral kingdom . shrubs , and even a few trees , emerged from crevices in the walls . i recognized some spurges that let their caustic , purgative sap trickle out . there were heliotropes , very remiss at living up to their sun - worshipping reputations since no sunlight ever reached them ; their clusters of flowers drooped sadly , their colors and scents were faded . here and there chrysanthemums sprouted timidly at the feet of aloes with long , sad , sickly leaves . but between these lava flows i spotted little violets that still gave off a subtle fragrance , and i confess that i inhaled it with delight . the soul of a flower is its scent , and those splendid water plants , flowers of the sea , have no souls !",174
"half an hour after the canadian 's latest exploits , we were back on the inner beach . there the local flora was represented by a wide carpet of samphire , a small umbelliferous plant that keeps quite nicely , which also boasts the names glasswort , saxifrage , and sea fennel . conseil picked a couple bunches . as for the local fauna , it included thousands of crustaceans of every type : lobsters , hermit crabs , prawns , mysid shrimps , daddy longlegs , rock crabs , and a prodigious number of seashells , such as cowries , murex snails , and limpets .",34
"properly speaking , the sargasso sea covers every submerged part of atlantis . certain authors have even held that the many weeds strewn over this sea were torn loose from the prairies of that ancient continent . but it 's more likely that these grasses , algae , and fucus plants were carried off from the beaches of europe and america , then taken as far as this zone by the gulf stream . this is one of the reasons why christopher columbus assumed the existence of a new world . when the ships of that bold investigator arrived in the sargasso sea , they had great difficulty navigating in the midst of these weeds , which , much to their crews ' dismay , slowed them down to a halt ; and they wasted three long weeks crossing this sector .",50
"in the midst of this hopelessly tangled fabric of weeds and fucus plants , i noted some delightful pink - colored , star - shaped alcyon coral , sea anemone trailing the long tresses of their tentacles , some green , red , and blue jellyfish , and especially those big rhizostome jellyfish that cuvier described , whose bluish parasols are trimmed with violet festoons .",12
"these polyparies were sticking to rocks , shells of mollusks , and even the stalks of water plants . they adorned the smallest crevices , some sprawling , others standing or hanging like coral outgrowths . i told conseil that sponges are fished up in two ways , either by dragnet or by hand . the latter method calls for the services of a diver , but it 's preferable because it spares the polypary 's tissue , leaving it with a much higher market value .",17
"they were tragopans , ornamented by a pendant skin which hangs over their throats , and by two small , round horns , planted behind the eyes .",23
""" just this , captain . in going toward the ocean 's lower strata , we know that vegetable life disappears more quickly than animal life . we know that moving creatures can still be encountered where water plants no longer grow . we know that oysters and pilgrim scallops live in 2,000 meters of water , and that admiral mcclintock , england 's hero of the polar seas , pulled in a live sea star from a depth of 2,500 meters . we know that the crew of the royal navy 's bulldog fished up a starfish from 2,620 fathoms , hence from a depth of more than one vertical league . would you still say , captain nemo , that we really know nothing ?

"going back under the waters , the nautilus drew near the coast , cruising along it for only a few miles . through the lounge windows i could see long creepers and gigantic fucus plants , bulb - bearing seaweed of which the open sea at the pole had revealed a few specimens ; with their smooth , viscous filaments , they measured as much as 300 meters long ; genuine cables more than an inch thick and very tough , they 're often used as mooring lines for ships . another weed , known by the name velp and boasting four - foot leaves , was crammed into the coral concretions and carpeted the ocean floor . it served as both nest and nourishment for myriads of crustaceans and mollusks , for crabs and cuttlefish . here seals and otters could indulge in a sumptuous meal , mixing meat from fish with vegetables from the sea , like the english with their irish stews .",34
"it was of little importance whether it was horizontal or not , and it did not matter much whether the stick six feet high , which was planted there , rose perpendicularly .",27
"these rocks were hung with huge weeds , immense sea tangle , gigantic fucus-- a genuine trellis of water plants fit for a world of giants .",19
"there were but few trees . herbaceous plants alone existed . there were tall grasses , ferns , lycopods , besides sigillaria , asterophyllites , now scarce plants , but then the species might be counted by thousands .",27
"besides , herbert discovered towards the southwest point of the lagoon a natural warren , a slightly damp meadow , covered with willows and aromatic herbs which scented the air , such as thyme , basil , savory , all the sweet - scented species of the labiated plants , which the rabbits appeared to be particularly fond of .",48
""" you talk about sperm whales , "" he said , "" as if they were little beasts ! but there are stories of gigantic sperm whales . they 're shrewd cetaceans . i hear that some will cover themselves with algae and fucus plants . people mistake them for islets . they pitch camp on top , make themselves at home , light a fire-- """,44
"as soon as i was dressed , i made my way to the main lounge . it was deserted . i dove into studying the conchological treasures amassed inside the glass cases . i also investigated the huge plant albums that were filled with the rarest marine herbs , which , although they were pressed and dried , still kept their wonderful colors . among these valuable water plants , i noted various seaweed : some cladostephus verticillatus , peacock 's tails , fig - leafed caulerpa , grain - bearing beauty bushes , delicate rosetangle tinted scarlet , sea colander arranged into fan shapes , mermaid 's cups that looked like the caps of squat mushrooms and for years had been classified among the zoophytes ; in short , a complete series of algae .",38

"it was a little before the great rains just now mentioned that i threw this stuff away , taking no notice , and not so much as remembering that i had thrown anything there , when , about a month after , or thereabouts , i saw some few stalks of something green shooting out of the ground , which i fancied might be some plant i had not seen ; but i was surprised , and perfectly astonished , when , after a little longer time , i saw about ten or twelve ears come out , which were perfect green barley , of the same kind as our european â€” nay , as our english barley .",65
"gideon spilett was at first surprised at the odor which exhaled from certain plants with straight stalks , round and branchy , bearing grape - like clusters of flowers and very small berries .",13

"the vegetation on this desolate continent struck me as quite limited . a few lichens of the species usnea melanoxanthra sprawled over the black rocks . the whole meager flora of this region consisted of certain microscopic buds , rudimentary diatoms made up of a type of cell positioned between two quartz - rich shells , plus long purple and crimson fucus plants , buoyed by small air bladders and washed up on the coast by the surf .",62
