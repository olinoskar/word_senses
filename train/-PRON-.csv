"on the contrary , the engineer inclined it towards the south , that is to say , in the direction of the coast opposite to the sun , for it must not be forgotten that the settlers in lincoln island , as the island was situated in the southern hemisphere , saw the radiant planet describe its diurnal arc above the northern , and not above the southern horizon .",56,"('-PRON-', 'son', 'su')",0

"in fact , the catalan method , properly so called , requires the construction of kilns and crucibles , in which the ore and the coal , placed in alternate layers , are transformed and reduced , but cyrus harding intended to economize these constructions , and wished simply to form , with the ore and the coal , a cubic mass , to the center of which he would direct the wind from his bellows .",74,"('-PRON-', 'son', 'su')",0

i shared the results of my observations with the canadian and conseil .,5,"('-PRON-', 'mon', 'mi')",1
"we did n't leave these patagonian waterways until april 3 , sometimes cruising under the ocean , sometimes on its surface . the nautilus passed the wide estuary formed by the mouth of the rio de la plata , and on april 4 we lay abreast of uruguay , albeit fifty miles out . keeping to its northerly heading , it followed the long windings of south america . by then we had fared 16,000 leagues since coming on board in the seas of japan .",56,"('-PRON-', 'son', 'su')",0
"we cut the equator . twenty miles to the west lay guiana , french territory where we could easily have taken refuge . but the wind was blowing a strong gust , and the furious billows would not allow us to face them in a mere skiff . no doubt ned land understood this because he said nothing to me . for my part , i made no allusion to his escape plans because i did n't want to push him into an attempt that was certain to misfire .",62,"('-PRON-', 'mon', 'mi')",1

"i was readily compensated for this delay by fascinating research . during those two days of april 11 - 12 , the nautilus did n't leave the surface of the sea , and its trawl brought up a simply miraculous catch of zoophytes , fish , and reptiles .",33,"('-PRON-', 'son', 'su')",0
"poor conseil had assaulted an electric ray of the most dangerous species , the cumana . living in a conducting medium such as water , this bizarre animal can electrocute other fish from several meters away , so great is the power of its electric organ , an organ whose two chief surfaces measure at least twenty - seven square feet .",43,"('-PRON-', 'son', 'su')",0
"the same day an odd fishing practice further increased the nautilus 's stores , so full of game were these seas . our trawl brought up in its meshes a number of fish whose heads were topped by little oval slabs with fleshy edges . these were suckerfish from the third family of the subbrachian malacopterygia . these flat disks on their heads consist of crosswise plates of movable cartilage , between which the animals can create a vacuum , enabling them to stick to objects like suction cups .",27,"('-PRON-', 'son', 'su')",0
"the canadian was quite disheartened , having counted on putting his plans into execution in the gulf , either by reaching shore or by pulling alongside one of the many boats plying a coastal trade from one island to another . an escape attempt would have been quite feasible , assuming ned land managed to seize the skiff without the captain 's knowledge . but in midocean it was unthinkable .",10,"('-PRON-', 'son', 'su')",0
"this measure was distasteful to me . to my mind it would lead nowhere . we could hope for nothing from the nautilus 's commander but could depend only on ourselves . besides , for some time now the man had been gloomier , more withdrawn , less sociable . he seemed to be avoiding me . i encountered him only at rare intervals . he used to take pleasure in explaining the underwater wonders to me ; now he left me to my research and no longer entered the lounge .",83,"('-PRON-', 'mon', 'mi')",1

"there once more , through the panels opening into these caribbean waters ten meters below the surface of the waves , i found so many fascinating exhibits to describe in my daily notes ! among other zoophytes there were portuguese men - of - war known by the name physalia pelagica , like big , oblong bladders with a pearly sheen , spreading their membranes to the wind , letting their blue tentacles drift like silken threads ; to the eye delightful jellyfish , to the touch actual nettles that ooze a corrosive liquid . among the articulates there were annelid worms one and a half meters long , furnished with a pink proboscis , equipped with 1,700 organs of locomotion , snaking through the waters , and as they went , throwing off every gleam in the solar spectrum . from the fish branch there were manta rays , enormous cartilaginous fish ten feet long and weighing 600 pounds , their pectoral fin triangular , their midback slightly arched , their eyes attached to the edges of the face at the front of the head ; they floated like wreckage from a ship , sometimes fastening onto our windows like opaque shutters . there were american triggerfish for which nature has ground only black and white pigments , feather - shaped gobies that were long and plump with yellow fins and jutting jaws , sixteen - decimeter mackerel with short , sharp teeth , covered with small scales , and related to the albacore species . next came swarms of red mullet corseted in gold stripes from head to tail , their shining fins all aquiver , genuine masterpieces of jewelry , formerly sacred to the goddess diana , much in demand by rich romans , and about which the old saying goes : "" he who catches them does n't eat them ! "" finally , adorned with emerald ribbons and dressed in velvet and silk , golden angelfish passed before our eyes like courtiers in the paintings of veronese ; spurred gilthead stole by with their swift thoracic fins ; thread herring fifteen inches long were wrapped in their phosphorescent glimmers ; gray mullet thrashed the sea with their big fleshy tails ; red salmon seemed to mow the waves with their slicing pectorals ; and silver moonfish , worthy of their name , rose on the horizon of the waters like the whitish reflections of many moons .",30,"('-PRON-', 'mon', 'mi')",1
"how many other marvelous new specimens i still could have observed if , little by little , the nautilus had n't settled to the lower strata ! its slanting fins drew it to depths of 2,000 and 3,500 meters . there animal life was represented by nothing more than sea lilies , starfish , delightful crinoids with bell - shaped heads like little chalices on straight stems , top - shell snails , blood - red tooth shells , and fissurella snails , a large species of coastal mollusk .",27,"('-PRON-', 'son', 'su')",0

""" a dog ! "" said holmes . "" by jove , a curly - haired spaniel . poor mortimer will never see his pet again . well , i do not know that this place contains any secret which we have not already fathomed . he could hide his hound , but he could not hush its voice , and hence came those cries which even in daylight were not pleasant to hear . on an emergency he could keep the hound in the out - house at merripit , but it was always a risk , and it was only on the supreme day , which he regarded as the end of all his efforts , that he dared do it . this paste in the tin is no doubt the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed . it was suggested , of course , by the story of the family hell - hound , and by the desire to frighten old sir charles to death . no wonder the poor devil of a convict ran and screamed , even as our friend did , and as we ourselves might have done , when he saw such a creature bounding through the darkness of the moor upon his track . it was a cunning device , for , apart from the chance of driving your victim to his death , what peasant would venture to inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight of it , as many have done , upon the moor ? i said it in london , watson , and i say it again now , that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more dangerous man than he who is lying yonder""--he swept his long arm towards the huge mottled expanse of green - splotched bog which stretched away until it merged into the russet slopes of the moor .",23,"('-PRON-', 'son', 'su')",0
