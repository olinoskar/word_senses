"the ordinary sitting - room and bedrooms i left much as they were : for i knew diana and mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables , and chairs , and beds , than from the spectacle of the smartest innovations . still some novelty was necessary , to give to their return the piquancy with which i wished it to be invested .",33
chapter xxxviii . the professor in his chair again,7
"a week later dorian gray was sitting in the conservatory at selby royal , talking to the pretty duchess of monmouth , who with her husband , a jaded - looking man of sixty , was amongst his guests . it was tea- time , and the mellow light of the huge , lace - covered lamp that stood on the table lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service at which the duchess was presiding . her white hands were moving daintily among the cups , and her full red lips were smiling at something that dorian had whispered to her . lord henry was lying back in a silk - draped wicker chair , looking at them . on a peach - coloured divan sat lady narborough , pretending to listen to the duke 's description of the last brazilian beetle that he had added to his collection . three young men in elaborate smoking - suits were handing tea - cakes to some of the women . the house - party consisted of twelve people , and there were more expected to arrive on the next day .",117
"when the second act was over , there came a storm of hisses , and lord henry got up from his chair and put on his coat . "" she is quite beautiful , dorian , "" he said , "" but she ca n't act . let us go . """,21
"but on entering this study now i thought of none of all these wonders ; my uncle alone filled my thoughts . he had thrown himself into a velvet easy - chair , and was grasping between his hands a book over which he bent , pondering with intense admiration .",31
"he and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain : the other party , which was headed by colonel dent , sat down on the crescent of chairs .",27
"and as the other party withdrew , he and his band took the vacated seats . miss ingram placed herself at her leader 's right hand ; the other diviners filled the chairs on each side of him and her .",32
"miss eyre , draw your chair still a little farther forward : you are yet too far back ; i can not see you without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair , which i have no mind to do . """,5

"mr . rochester , as he sat in his damask - covered chair , looked different to what i had seen him look before ; not quite so stern -- much less gloomy .",12
"with this announcement he rose from his chair , and stood , leaning his arm on the marble mantelpiece : in that attitude his shape was seen plainly as well as his face ; his unusual breadth of chest , disproportionate almost to his length of limb .",7
"the footman who brought the coal , in going out , stopped near mr . eshton 's chair , and said something to him in a low voice , of which i heard only the words , "" old woman,""--""quite troublesome . """,17
""" i would n't have the scotland yarders know it for the world , "" he cried , dropping into his chair ; "" i have chaffed them so much that they would never have let me hear the end of it . i can afford to laugh , because i know that i will be even with them in the long run . """,21
""" ' god forgive you ! ' cried madame charpentier , throwing up her hands and sinking back in her chair . ' you have murdered your brother . '",20
have you no present interest in any of the company who occupy the sofas and chairs before you ?,15
""" yes , i thought you would like it , "" replied his host , rising from his chair .",18
"the intelligence with which lestrade greeted us was so momentous and so unexpected , that we were all three fairly dumfoundered . gregson sprang out of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water . i stared in silence at sherlock holmes , whose lips were compressed and his brows drawn down over his eyes .",27
""" it was quite thick enough before , "" grumbled lestrade , taking a chair . "" i seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war . """,14
"two young , graceful women -- ladies in every point -- sat , one in a low rocking - chair , the other on a lower stool ; both wore deep mourning of crape and bombazeen , which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and faces : a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one girl -- in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat .",19
"i said first , "" take a chair , mr . rivers . "" but he answered , as he always did , that he could not stay .",7
"she conducted me to her own chair , and then began to remove my shawl and untie my bonnet - strings ; i begged she would not give herself so much trouble .",6
"at last , liveried in the costume of the age , reality entered the room in the shape of a servant to tell the duchess that her carriage was waiting . she wrung her hands in mock despair . "" how annoying ! "" she cried . "" i must go . i have to call for my husband at the club , to take him to some absurd meeting at willis 's rooms , where he is going to be in the chair . if i am late he is sure to be furious , and i could n't have a scene in this bonnet . it is far too fragile . a harsh word would ruin it . no , i must go , dear agatha . good- bye , lord henry , you are quite delightful and dreadfully demoralizing . i am sure i do n't know what to say about your views . you must come and dine with us some night . tuesday ? are you disengaged tuesday ? """,83
""" ah ! that is very nice , and very wrong of you , "" she cried ; "" so mind you come "" ; and she swept out of the room , followed by lady agatha and the other ladies . when lord henry had sat down again , mr . erskine moved round , and taking a chair close to him , placed his hand upon his arm .",59
""" she likes you , i am sure , "" said i , as i stood behind his chair , "" and her father respects you .",18
""" forty of us , in forty arm - chairs . we are practising for an english academy of letters . """,9
""" indeed , sir ! the occupant of a professorial chair at the johannæum unable to explain the reason of a cosmical phenomenon ! why , it would be simply disgraceful ! """,10
"i wonder if he read that notion in my face ; for , all at once , without speaking , he struck suddenly and strongly . i tottered , and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his chair .",42
"at last he mastered her arms ; grace poole gave him a cord , and he pinioned them behind her : with more rope , which was at hand , he bound her to a chair .",35
"at that hour most of the others were sewing likewise ; but one class still stood round miss scatcherd 's chair reading , and as all was quiet , the subject of their lessons could be heard , together with the manner in which each girl acquitted herself , and the animadversions or commendations of miss scatcherd on the performance .",20
"as the hall door shut , campbell started nervously , and having got up from the chair , went over to the chimney - piece . he was shivering with a kind of ague . for nearly twenty minutes , neither of the men spoke . a fly buzzed noisily about the room , and the ticking of the clock was like the beat of a hammer .",16
""" what , you have got up ! "" she said . "" you are better , then . you may sit you down in my chair on the hearthstone , if you will . """,26
she pointed to the rocking - chair : i took it .,6
"and if nothing happens without his knowledge , he knows that i am here , and am in this dreadful condition ; and if nothing happens without his appointment , he has appointed all this to befall me . nothing occurred to my thought to contradict any of these conclusions , and therefore it rested upon me with the greater force , that it must needs be that god had appointed all this to befall me ; that i was brought into this miserable circumstance by his direction , he having the sole power , not of me only , but of everything that happened in the world . immediately it followed : why has god done this to me ? what have i done to be thus used ? my conscience presently checked me in that inquiry , as if i had blasphemed , and methought it spoke to me like a voice : “ wretch ! dost _ thou _ ask what thou hast done ? look back upon a dreadful misspent life , and ask thyself what thou hast _ not _ done ? ask , why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed ? why wert thou not drowned in yarmouth roads ; killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the sallee man - of - war ; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of africa ; or drowned _ here _ , when all the crew perished but thyself ? dost _ thou _ ask , what have i done ? ” i was struck dumb with these reflections , as one astonished , and had not a word to say — no , not to answer to myself , but rose up pensive and sad , walked back to my retreat , and went up over my wall , as if i had been going to bed ; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed , and i had no inclination to sleep ; so i sat down in my chair , and lighted my lamp , for it began to be dark . now , as the apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me very much , it occurred to my thought that the brazilians take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers , and i had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests , which was quite cured , and some also that was green , and not quite cured .",342
"she laughed and took his arm . "" you dear old jim , you talk as if you were a hundred . some day you will be in love yourself . then you will know what it is . do n't look so sulky . surely you should be glad to think that , though you are going away , you leave me happier than i have ever been before . life has been hard for us both , terribly hard and difficult . but it will be different now . you are going to a new world , and i have found one . here are two chairs ; let us sit down and see the smart people go by . """,108
""" ah ! what a cynic you are ! "" cried the old lady , pushing back her chair and nodding to lady ruxton . "" you must come and dine with me soon again . you are really an admirable tonic , much better than what sir andrew prescribes for me . you must tell me what people you would like to meet , though . i want it to be a delightful gathering .

"it was night : a candle burnt on the table ; bessie stood at the bed- foot with a basin in her hand , and a gentleman sat in a chair near my pillow , leaning over me .",30
"having given some further directions , and intimates that he should call again the next day , he departed ; to my grief : i felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near my pillow ; and as he closed the door after him , all the room darkened and my heart again sank : inexpressible sadness weighed it down .",35
"the old - fashioned chairs were very bright , and the walnut - wood table was like a looking - glass .",4
the jesuit and the curate quite started from their chairs .,9
