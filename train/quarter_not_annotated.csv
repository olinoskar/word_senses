"one might have said that at this distance she had already entered the vast bay , for a straight line drawn from claw cape to cape mandible would have rested on her starboard quarter .",33
"at 4:17 in the afternoon , during a high tea for passengers gathered in the main lounge , a collision occurred , scarcely noticeable on the whole , affecting the scotia 's hull in that quarter a little astern of its port paddle wheel .",35
therefore the brig was about a mile and a quarter from the coast .,9
but the stranger knew not the headstrong personage he had to do with ; d’artagnan was not the man ever to cry for quarter .,23
"candide and cacambo got into the coach , the six sheep flew , and , in less than a quarter of an hour , they arrived at the king 's palace , which was situated at the further end of the capital .",19
"so saying , captain nemo unfurled a black flag bearing a gold "" n "" on its quartered bunting . then , turning toward the orb of day , whose last rays were licking at the sea 's horizon :",17

"passepartout was crushed ; it overwhelmed him to lose the boat by three - quarters of an hour . it was his fault , for , instead of helping his master , he had not ceased putting obstacles in his path ! and when he recalled all the incidents of the tour , when he counted up the sums expended in pure loss and on his own account , when he thought that the immense stake , added to the heavy charges of this useless journey , would completely ruin mr . fogg , he overwhelmed himself with bitter self - accusations . mr . fogg , however , did not reproach him ; and , on leaving the cunard pier , only said : "" we will consult about what is best to - morrow . come . """,14
"mr . fogg left the hotel alone , after giving passepartout instructions to await his return , and inform aouda to be ready at an instant 's notice . he proceeded to the banks of the hudson , and looked about among the vessels moored or anchored in the river , for any that were about to depart . several had departure signals , and were preparing to put to sea at morning tide ; for in this immense and admirable port there is not one day in a hundred that vessels do not set out for every quarter of the globe . but they were mostly sailing vessels , of which , of course , phileas fogg could make no use .",98
""" good , "" said mr . fogg . "" the train leaves for dover at a quarter before nine . i will take it . """,17
""" this very evening , "" returned phileas fogg . he took out and consulted a pocket almanac , and added , "" as today is wednesday , the 2nd of october , i shall be due in london in this very room of the reform club , on saturday , the 21st of december , at a quarter before nine p.m. ; or else the twenty thousand pounds , now deposited in my name at baring 's , will belong to you , in fact and in right , gentlemen . here is a cheque for the amount .

"i can not estimate the distance traversed by the balloon at less than six to seven thousand miles , and , even supposing that the wind had varied half a quarter , it must have brought us either to the archipelago of mendava , either on the pomotous , or even , if it had a greater strength than i suppose , to the land of new zealand .",30
"now , one evening when d’artagnan , who was in the trenches , was not able to accompany them , athos , porthos , and aramis , mounted on their battle steeds , enveloped in their war cloaks , with their hands upon their pistol butts , were returning from a drinking place called the red dovecot , which athos had discovered two days before upon the route to jarrie , following the road which led to the camp and quite on their guard , as we have stated , for fear of an ambuscade , when , about a quarter of a league from the village of boisnau , they fancied they heard the sound of horses approaching them . they immediately all three halted , closed in , and waited , occupying the middle of the road . in an instant , and as the moon broke from behind a cloud , they saw at a turning of the road two horsemen who , on perceiving them , stopped in their turn , appearing to deliberate whether they should continue their route or go back .",100
". . . . "" forty seconds , "" said my uncle . "" forty seconds between the two words ; so the sound takes twenty seconds in coming . now , at the rate of 1,120 feet in a second , this is 22,400 feet , or four miles and a quarter , nearly . """,52

"at the far end stood a fourth watertight bulkhead , separating the crew 's quarters from the engine room . a door opened , and i stood in the compartment where captain nemo , indisputably a world - class engineer , had set up his locomotive equipment .",14
"work began immediately and was carried on with tireless tenacity . instead of digging all around the nautilus , which would have entailed even greater difficulties , captain nemo had an immense trench outlined on the ice , eight meters from our port quarter . then his men simultaneously staked it off at several points around its circumference . soon their picks were vigorously attacking this compact matter , and huge chunks were loosened from its mass . these chunks weighed less than the water , and by an unusual effect of specific gravity , each chunk took wing , as it were , to the roof of the tunnel , which thickened above by as much as it diminished below . but this hardly mattered so long as the lower surface kept growing thinner .",43
"this scene lasted barely a few seconds . the shark returned , rolled over on its back , and was getting ready to cut the indian in half , when captain nemo , who was stationed beside me , suddenly stood up . then he strode right toward the monster , dagger in hand , ready to fight it at close quarters .",61
"nothing else until the moment when , through a rift in the clouds , i saw the daring captain clinging to one of the animal 's fins , fighting the monster at close quarters , belaboring his enemy 's belly with stabs of the dagger yet unable to deliver the deciding thrust , in other words , a direct hit to the heart . in its struggles the man - eater churned the watery mass so furiously , its eddies threatened to knock me over .",33
"phileas fogg counted on gaining twelve hours in the same way . instead of arriving at liverpool the next evening by the henrietta , he would be there by noon , and would therefore have time to reach london before a quarter before nine in the evening .",41
"that gentleman was really ruined , and that at the moment when he was about to attain his end . this arrest was fatal . having arrived at liverpool at twenty minutes before twelve on the 21st of december , he had till a quarter before nine that evening to reach the reform club , that is , nine hours and a quarter ; the journey from liverpool to london was six hours .",44

"his warm and fickle imagination , which in gascony had rendered formidable to young chambermaids , and even sometimes their mistresses , had never dreamed , even in moments of delirium , of half the amorous wonders or a quarter of the feats of gallantry which were here set forth in connection with names the best known and with details the least concealed .",39
"two cable lengths off the abraham lincoln 's starboard quarter , the sea seemed to be lit up from underneath . this was no mere phosphorescent phenomenon , that much was unmistakable . submerged some fathoms below the surface of the water , the monster gave off that very intense but inexplicable glow that several captains had mentioned in their reports . this magnificent radiance had to come from some force with a great illuminating capacity . the edge of its light swept over the sea in an immense , highly elongated oval , condensing at the center into a blazing core whose unbearable glow diminished by degrees outward .",9
"just as harding had calculated , she was not more than a mile and a quarter from the coast .",15
"again i looked out : we were passing a church ; i saw its low broad tower against the sky , and its bell was tolling a quarter ; i saw a narrow galaxy of lights too , on a hillside , marking a village or hamlet .",27
"he had , at least , one resource,--to call on the french and english consuls at yokohama for assistance . but he shrank from telling the story of his adventures , intimately connected as it was with that of his master ; and , before doing so , he determined to exhaust all other means of aid . as chance did not favour him in the european quarter , he penetrated that inhabited by the native japanese , determined , if necessary , to push on to yeddo .",67
""" yes , "" said porthos , "" that is a duchess of my acquaintance whom i have great trouble to meet on account of the jealousy of her husband , and who sent me word that she should come today to this poor church , buried in this vile quarter , solely for the sake of seeing me . """,50
"the worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat as hearty a breakfast as possible before leaving the carnatic ; but , as he had been walking about all day , the demands of hunger were becoming importunate . he observed that the butchers stalls contained neither mutton , goat , nor pork ; and , knowing also that it is a sacrilege to kill cattle , which are preserved solely for farming , he made up his mind that meat was far from plentiful in yokohama -- nor was he mistaken ; and , in default of butcher 's meat , he could have wished for a quarter of wild boar or deer , a partridge , or some quails , some game or fish , which , with rice , the japanese eat almost exclusively . but he found it necessary to keep up a stout heart , and to postpone the meal he craved till the following morning . night came , and passepartout re - entered the native quarter , where he wandered through the streets , lit by vari - coloured lanterns , looking on at the dancers , who were executing skilful steps and boundings , and the astrologers who stood in the open air with their telescopes . then he came to the harbour , which was lit up by the resin torches of the fishermen , who were fishing from their boats .",109

"while he was arguing in this manner , the sky was overcast , the winds blew from the four quarters of the compass , and the ship was assailed by a most terrible tempest , within sight of the port of lisbon .",19
"my eyes flew back to the pressure gauge . the instrument indicated a depth of 6,000 meters . our submergence had been going on for an hour . the nautilus slid downward on its slanting fins , still sinking . these deserted waters were wonderfully clear , with a transparency impossible to convey . an hour later we were at 13,000 meters-- about three and a quarter vertical leagues -- and the ocean floor was nowhere in sight .",66
"his five friends of the reform club passed these three days in a state of feverish suspense . would phileas fogg , whom they had forgotten , reappear before their eyes ! where was he at this moment ? the 17th of december , the day of james strand 's arrest , was the seventy - sixth since phileas fogg 's departure , and no news of him had been received . was he dead ? had he abandoned the effort , or was he continuing his journey along the route agreed upon ? and would he appear on saturday , the 21st of december , at a quarter before nine in the evening , on the threshold of the reform club saloon ?",108
"he followed the clown , and soon found himself once more in the japanese quarter . a quarter of an hour later he stopped before a large cabin , adorned with several clusters of streamers , the exterior walls of which were designed to represent , in violent colours and without perspective , a company of jugglers .",14

"the good old beldame kept a profound silence . in the evening she returned , but without his supper . "" come along with me , "" said she , "" but do not speak a word .

the clock indicated a quarter before nine when he appeared in the great saloon .,4
""" nothing easier , "" captain nemo said . and he pressed an electric button , transmitting an order to the crew 's quarters .",23
"but they had in no way surveyed the woods which covered the serpentine peninsula , all to the right of the mercy , the left bank of falls river , and the wilderness of spurs and valleys which supported three quarters of the base of mount franklin , to the east , the north , and the west , and where doubtless many secret retreats existed .",40
"the guards , under the command of m. dessessart , took up their quarters at the minimes ; but , as we know , d’artagnan , possessed with ambition to enter the musketeers , had formed but few friendships among his comrades , and he felt himself isolated and given up to his own reflections .",13
"only with that word you would be quartered instead of being broken on the wheel . """,7

"this affair put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the other savages , who were now almost out of sight ; and it was happy for us that we did not , for it blew so hard within two hours after , and before they could be got a quarter of their way , and continued blowing so hard all night , and that from the north - west , which was against them , that i could not suppose their boat could live , or that they ever reached their own coast .",52

"he motioned to me to look . an exclamation of astonishment burst from me . the north pole of the needle was turned to what we supposed to be the south . it pointed to the shore instead of to the open sea ! i shook the box , examined it again , it was in perfect condition . in whatever position i placed the box the needle pertinaciously returned to this unexpected quarter . therefore there seemed no reason to doubt that during the storm there had been a sudden change of wind unperceived by us , which had brought our raft back to the shore which we thought we had left so long a distance behind us .",73
"on january 25 , the ocean being completely deserted , the nautilus spent the day on the surface , churning the waves with its powerful propeller and making them spurt to great heights . under these conditions , who would n't have mistaken it for a gigantic cetacean ? i spent three - quarters of the day on the platform . i stared at the sea . nothing on the horizon , except near four o'clock in the afternoon a long steamer to the west , running on our opposite tack . its masting was visible for an instant , but it could n't have seen the nautilus because we were lying too low in the water . i imagine that steamboat belonged to the peninsular & oriental line , which provides service from the island of ceylon to sidney , also calling at king george sound and melbourne .",53
