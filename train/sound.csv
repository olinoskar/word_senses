"hallward amused himself with watching the faces in the pit . the heat was terribly oppressive , and the huge sunlight flamed like a monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire . the youths in the gallery had taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them over the side . they talked to each other across the theatre and shared their oranges with the tawdry girls who sat beside them . some women were laughing in the pit . their voices were horribly shrill and discordant . the sound of the popping of corks came from the bar .",89,"('sound', 'bruit', 'ruido')",0
"then she continued her singing with inexpressible fervor and feeling . it appeared to her that the sounds spread to a distance beneath the vaulted roofs , and carried with them a magic charm to soften the hearts of her jailers .",17,"('sound', 'son', 'sonido')",1
"a sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor . crouching among the stones we stared intently at the silver - tipped bank in front of us . the steps grew louder , and through the fog , as through a curtain , there stepped the man whom we were awaiting . he looked round him in surprise as he emerged into the clear , starlit night . then he came swiftly along the path , passed close to where we lay , and went on up the long slope behind us . as he walked he glanced continually over either shoulder , like a man who is ill at ease .",1,"('sound', 'bruit', 'ruido')",0
"several hours passed . the weather was dismal , and it was very cold . fix sat motionless on a bench in the station ; he might have been thought asleep . aouda , despite the storm , kept coming out of the waiting - room , going to the end of the platform , and peering through the tempest of snow , as if to pierce the mist which narrowed the horizon around her , and to hear , if possible , some welcome sound . she heard and saw nothing . then she would return , chilled through , to issue out again after the lapse of a few moments , but always in vain .",85,"('sound', 'bruit', 'ruido')",0
"crossing through the lounge , i arrived at the door , contrived in one of the canted corners , that opened into the captain 's stateroom . much to my astonishment , this door was ajar . i instinctively recoiled . if captain nemo was in his stateroom , he might see me . but , not hearing any sounds , i approached . the stateroom was deserted . i pushed the door open . i took a few steps inside . still the same austere , monastic appearance .",59,"('sound', 'bruit', 'ruido')",0
"as if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast gloom of the moor that strange cry which i had already heard upon the borders of the great grimpen mire . it came with the wind through the silence of the night , a long , deep mutter , then a rising howl , and then the sad moan in which it died away . again and again it sounded , the whole air throbbing with it , strident , wild , and menacing . the baronet caught my sleeve and his face glimmered white through the darkness .",73,"('sound', 'retentir', 'resonar')",2
""" i do n't know . it 's a sound they have on the moor . i heard it once before . """,9,"('sound', 'bruit', 'sonido')",3

"then only she pretended to hear the sound of felton ’s steps , and rising quick as thought , she blushed , as if ashamed of being surprised on her knees .",7,"('sound', 'bruit', 'ruido')",0
she was awakened by a soft voice which sounded at the foot of her bed .,8,"('sound', 'retentir', 'resonar')",2
"this acoustic effect is easily explained on scientific grounds . it arose from the concave form of the gallery and the conducting power of the rock . there are many examples of this propagation of sounds which remain unheard in the intermediate space . i remember that a similar phenomenon has been observed in many places ; amongst others on the internal surface of the gallery of the dome of st . paul 's in london , and especially in the midst of the curious caverns among the quarries near syracuse , the most wonderful of which is called dionysius ' ear .",35,"('sound', 'son', 'sonido')",1

"he said this , in his peculiar , subdued , yet emphatic voice ; looking , when he had ceased speaking , not at me , but at the setting sun , at which i looked too . both he and i had our backs towards the path leading up the field to the wicket . we had heard no step on that grass - grown track ; the water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and scene ; we might well then start when a gay voice , sweet as a silver bell , exclaimed--",78,"('sound', 'bruit', 'rumor')",5
"the four friends listened , and the sound of the drum plainly reached them .",7,"('sound', 'bruit', 'ruido')",0
he had walked as one walks in a dream ; he had a glimpse of objects as through a fog . his ears had perceived sounds without comprehending them ; he might have been executed at that moment without his making a single gesture in his own defense or uttering a cry to implore mercy .,25,"('sound', 'son', 'sonido')",1
"the next day , january 6 : nothing new on board . not a sound inside , not a sign of life . the skiff stayed alongside in the same place we had left it . we decided to return to gueboroa island . ned land hoped for better luck in his hunting than on the day before , and he wanted to visit a different part of the forest .",14,"('sound', 'bruit', 'ruido')",0

"on february 8 , as early as the first hours of daylight , mocha appeared before us : a town now in ruins , whose walls would collapse at the mere sound of a cannon , and which shelters a few leafy date trees here and there . this once - important city used to contain six public marketplaces plus twenty - six mosques , and its walls , protected by fourteen forts , fashioned a three - kilometer girdle around it .",31,"('sound', 'bruit', 'ruido')",0
""" fine . stoke your furnaces and clap on full steam !

"but at the first word the young woman started , and exclaimed in a sharp , bantering tone , which sounded strangely in the darkness , "" are you afraid , dear monsieur d’artagnan ? """,20,"('sound', 'résonner', 'resonar')",6
"there was a stifled groan and the horrible sound of some one choking with blood . three times the outstretched arms shot up convulsively , waving grotesque , stiff - fingered hands in the air . he stabbed him twice more , but the man did not move . something began to trickle on the floor . he waited for a moment , still pressing the head down . then he threw the knife on the table , and listened .",8,"('sound', 'bruit', 'ruido')",0
"having locked the door behind him , he crept quietly downstairs . the woodwork creaked and seemed to cry out as if in pain . he stopped several times and waited . no : everything was still . it was merely the sound of his own footsteps .",42,"('sound', 'bruit', 'ruido')",0
"again the agonized cry swept through the silent night , louder and much nearer than ever . and a new sound mingled with it , a deep , muttered rumble , musical and yet menacing , rising and falling like the low , constant murmur of the sea .",20,"('sound', 'bruit', 'ruido')",0
"at times , again , i was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness , for i beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours , in an attitude of the profoundest attention , as if listening to some imaginary sound .",44,"('sound', 'bruit', 'ruido')",0
"at six o'clock , sometimes afloat and sometimes submerged , the nautilus passed well out from el tur , which sat at the far end of a bay whose waters seemed to be dyed red , as captain nemo had already mentioned . then night fell in the midst of a heavy silence occasionally broken by the calls of pelicans and nocturnal birds , by the sound of surf chafing against rocks , or by the distant moan of a steamer churning the waves of the gulf with noisy blades .",66,"('sound', 'bruit', 'rumor')",5
"i experienced a strange feeling as the key grated in the lock , and the sound of his retreating step ceased to be heard .",15,"('sound', 'bruit', 'rumor')",5
"amidst all this , i had to listen as well as watch : to listen for the movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den . but since mr . rochester 's visit it seemed spellbound : all the night i heard but three sounds at three long intervals,--a step creak , a momentary renewal of the snarling , canine noise , and a deep human groan .",48,"('sound', 'son', 'sonido')",1
"motionless , with her burning and fixed glances , in her solitary apartment , how well the outbursts of passion which at times escape from the depths of her chest with her respiration , accompany the sound of the surf which rises , growls , roars , and breaks itself like an eternal and powerless despair against the rocks on which is built this dark and lofty castle !",36,"('sound', 'bruit', 'ruido')",0

"what was that ? in the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound — low , but very distinct in the quiet of the night . it came from the door of the house . ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently . there was a pause for a few moments , and then the low insidious sound was repeated . someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the panels of the door . was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal ? or was it some agent who was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived . john ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook his nerves and chilled his heart . springing forward he drew the bolt and threw the door open .",12,"('sound', 'bruit', 'ruido')",0
"finally this long night was over . my imperfect memories wo n't let me recall my every impression of it . a single detail comes back to me . several times , during various lulls of wind and sea , i thought i heard indistinct sounds , a sort of elusive harmony produced by distant musical chords . what was the secret behind this underwater navigating , whose explanation the whole world had sought in vain ? what beings lived inside this strange boat ? what mechanical force allowed it to move about with such prodigious speed ?",45,"('sound', 'son', 'sonido')",1
in a few minutes the bell sounded .,6,"('sound', 'résonner', 'resonar')",6
"i started moving , groping my way . after five steps i encountered an iron wall made of riveted boilerplate . then , turning around , i bumped into a wooden table next to which several stools had been set . the floor of this prison lay hidden beneath thick , hempen matting that deadened the sound of footsteps . its naked walls did n't reveal any trace of a door or window . going around the opposite way , conseil met up with me , and we returned to the middle of this cabin , which had to be twenty feet long by ten wide . as for its height , not even ned land , with his great stature , was able to determine it .",56,"('sound', 'bruit', 'ruido')",0
"this sudden illumination of our cabin enabled me to examine its tiniest details . it contained only a table and five stools . its invisible door must have been hermetically sealed . not a sound reached our ears . everything seemed dead inside this boat . was it in motion , or stationary on the surface of the ocean , or sinking into the depths ? i could n't tell .",34,"('sound', 'bruit', 'ruido')",0

"we had been gone from the nautilus for about an hour and a half . it was almost noon . i spotted this fact in the perpendicularity of the sun 's rays , which were no longer refracted . the magic of these solar colors disappeared little by little , with emerald and sapphire shades vanishing from our surroundings altogether . we walked with steady steps that rang on the seafloor with astonishing intensity . the tiniest sounds were transmitted with a speed to which the ear is unaccustomed on shore . in fact , water is a better conductor of sound than air , and under the waves noises carry four times as fast .",77,"('sound', 'bruit', 'ruido')",0
but the subterranean sounds were too perceptible to allow of the supposition that it was of any great thickness .,3,"('sound', 'bruit', 'ruido')",0

"the moment the hand of bonacieux sounded on the door , the two young people felt their hearts bound within them .",6,"('sound', 'résonner', 'resonar')",6
