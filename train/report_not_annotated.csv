"on january 28 , in latitude 9 degrees 4 ' north , when the nautilus returned at noon to the surface of the sea , it lay in sight of land some eight miles to the west . right off , i observed a cluster of mountains about 2,000 feet high , whose shapes were very whimsically sculpted . after our position fix , i reentered the lounge , and when our bearings were reported on the chart , i saw that we were off the island of ceylon , that pearl dangling from the lower lobe of the indian peninsula .",74

"but just then the renowned french explorer captain dumont d'urville , unaware of dillon 's activities , had already set sail to search elsewhere for the site of the shipwreck . in essence , a whaling vessel had reported that some medals and a cross of st . louis had been found in the hands of savages in the louisiade islands and new caledonia .",38
"pretty perplexed , dumont d'urville did n't know if he should give credence to these reports , which had been carried in some of the less reliable newspapers ; nevertheless , he decided to start on dillon 's trail .",15

"the musketeer could not forget the evil reports which then prevailed , and which indeed have survived them , of the procurators of the period -- meanness , stinginess , fasts ; but as , after all , excepting some few acts of economy which porthos had always found very unseasonable , the procurator ’s wife had been tolerably liberal -- that is , be it understood , for a procurator ’s wife -- he hoped to see a household of a highly comfortable kind .",7

"i estimate -- but perhaps i 'm mistaken -- that the nautilus 's haphazard course continued for fifteen or twenty days , and i 'm not sure how long this would have gone on without the catastrophe that ended our voyage . as for captain nemo , he was no longer in the picture . as for his chief officer , the same applied . not one crewman was visible for a single instant . the nautilus cruised beneath the waters almost continuously . when it rose briefly to the surface to renew our air , the hatches opened and closed as if automated . no more positions were reported on the world map . i did n't know where we were .",109
there were also less agreeable visits -- for two or three times reports were spread that the cardinal had nearly been assassinated .,12
"gideon spilett ranked among the first of those reporters : a man of great merit , energetic , prompt and ready for anything , full of ideas , having traveled over the whole world , soldier and artist , enthusiastic in council , resolute in action , caring neither for trouble , fatigue , nor danger , when in pursuit of information , for himself first , and then for his journal , a perfect treasury of knowledge on all sorts of curious subjects , of the unpublished , of the unknown , and of the impossible . he was one of those intrepid observers who write under fire , "" reporting "" among bullets , and to whom every danger is welcome .",111

"i went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning 's conversation for holmes . it was evident to me that he had been very busy of late , for the notes which i had from baker street were few and short , with no comments upon the information which i had supplied and hardly any reference to my mission . no doubt his blackmailing case is absorbing all his faculties . and yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his interest . i wish that he were here .",11

"but perhaps it had been only his fancy that had called vengeance out of the night and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him . actual life was chaos , but there was something terribly logical in the imagination . it was the imagination that set remorse to dog the feet of sin . it was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen brood . in the common world of fact the wicked were not punished , nor the good rewarded . success was given to the strong , failure thrust upon the weak . that was all . besides , had any stranger been prowling round the house , he would have been seen by the servants or the keepers . had any foot - marks been found on the flower - beds , the gardeners would have reported it . yes , it had been merely fancy . sibyl vane 's brother had not come back to kill him . he had sailed away in his ship to founder in some winter sea . from him , at any rate , he was safe . why , the man did not know who he was , could not know who he was . the mask of youth had saved him .",142
