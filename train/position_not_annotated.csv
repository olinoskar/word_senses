"but it was not her business to think for me , or to seek a place for me : besides , in her eyes , how doubtful must have appeared my character , position , tale .",33
"they were thrown about and whirled round and round without feeling the rotation in the slightest degree , or being sensible that they were removed from a horizontal position .",28
""" will he believe that your eminence is in a position to accomplish the threat thus made ? """,10
"for ned land , as well as for every navigator before us , i knew that this was the great insurmountable obstacle . when the sun appeared for an instant near noon , captain nemo took a reasonably accurate sight that gave our position as longitude 51 degrees 30 ' and latitude 67 degrees 39 ' south . this was a position already well along in these antarctic regions .",61
""" in order to steer this boat to port or starboard , in short , to make turns on a horizontal plane , i use an ordinary , wide - bladed rudder that 's fastened to the rear of the sternpost and worked by a wheel and tackle . but i can also move the nautilus upward and downward on a vertical plane by the simple method of slanting its two fins , which are attached to its sides at its center of flotation ; these fins are flexible , able to assume any position , and can be operated from inside by means of powerful levers . if these fins stay parallel with the boat , the latter moves horizontally . if they slant , the nautilus follows the angle of that slant and , under its propeller 's thrust , either sinks on a diagonal as steep as it suits me , or rises on that diagonal . and similarly , if i want to return more swiftly to the surface , i throw the propeller in gear , and the water 's pressure makes the nautilus rise vertically , as an air balloon inflated with hydrogen lifts swiftly into the skies .

the equality between her and me was real ; not the mere result of condescension on her part : so much the better -- my position was all the freer .,25
"towards midday the balloon was hovering above the sea at a height of only 2,000 feet . it contained 50,000 cubic feet of gas , and , thanks to its capacity , it could maintain itself a long time in the air , although it should reach a great altitude or might be thrown into a horizontal position .",57
"the strangest thing of all was , that not a soul in the house , except me , noticed her habits , or seemed to marvel at them : no one discussed her position or employment ; no one pitied her solitude or isolation .",33
"it was the ocean , without any visible limits , even for those whose gaze , from their commanding position , extended over a radius of forty miles .",19
"i was on the platform just then . after determining our position , the captain pronounced only these words :",11
"herbert fetched the atlas , and the map of the pacific was opened , and the engineer , compass in hand , prepared to determine their position .",26
"there the captain fixed his position and used a chronometer to calculate his longitude , which he double - checked against his previous observations of hour angles . then he told me :",5
it is sufficient to throw out the lightest article to produce a difference in its vertical position .,16
"at noon the next day , november 5 , the agreed - upon delay expired . after a position fix , true to his promise , commander farragut would have to set his course for the southeast and leave the northerly regions of the pacific decisively behind .",18
"they dispersed about the room , reminding me , by the lightness and buoyancy of their movements , of a flock of white plumy birds . some of them threw themselves in half - reclining positions on the sofas and ottomans : some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books : the rest gathered in a group round the fire : all talked in a low but clear tone which seemed habitual to them .",35
"what had occurred since , calculated to change his and my relative positions ?",12
"we were traveling due west and on january 11 we doubled cape wessel , located in longitude 135 degrees and latitude 10 degrees north , the western tip of the gulf of carpentaria . reefs were still numerous but more widely scattered and were fixed on the chart with the greatest accuracy . the nautilus easily avoided the money breakers to port and the victoria reefs to starboard , positioned at longitude 130 degrees on the tenth parallel , which we went along rigorously .",69
"after our position fix , the nautilus 's latitude bearings were modulated to the southwest . our prow pointed to the indian ocean . where would captain nemo 's fancies take us ? would he head up to the shores of asia ? would he pull nearer to the beaches of europe ? unlikely choices for a man who avoided populated areas ! so would he go down south ? would he double the cape of good hope , then cape horn , and push on to the antarctic pole ? finally , would he return to the seas of the pacific , where his nautilus could navigate freely and easily ? time would tell .",2
"i estimate -- but perhaps i 'm mistaken -- that the nautilus 's haphazard course continued for fifteen or twenty days , and i 'm not sure how long this would have gone on without the catastrophe that ended our voyage . as for captain nemo , he was no longer in the picture . as for his chief officer , the same applied . not one crewman was visible for a single instant . the nautilus cruised beneath the waters almost continuously . when it rose briefly to the surface to renew our air , the hatches opened and closed as if automated . no more positions were reported on the world map . i did n't know where we were .",107
i showed conseil the position of this long reef on our chart of the mediterranean .,4
"suddenly a slight movement could be felt over the hull . obviously the nautilus was straightening a bit . objects hanging in the lounge were visibly returning to their normal positions . the walls were approaching the vertical . nobody said a word . hearts pounding , we could see and feel the ship righting itself . the floor was becoming horizontal beneath our feet . ten minutes went by .",30
"she made an effort to alter her position , but failed : her face changed ; she seemed to experience some inward sensation -- the precursor , perhaps , of the last pang .",7
"cyrus harding announced this result to his companions , and taking into consideration errors of observation , as he had done for the latitude , he believed he could positively affirm that the position of lincoln island was between the thirty - fifth and the thirty - seventh parallel , and between the hundred and fiftieth and the hundred and fifty - fifth meridian to the west of the meridian of greenwich .",33
"the possible fault which he attributed to errors in the observation was , it may be seen , of five degrees on both sides , which , at sixty miles to a degree , would give an error of three hundred miles in latitude and longitude for the exact position .",49
"captain nemo inserted his cranium into its spherical headgear . conseil and i did the same , but not without hearing the canadian toss us a sarcastic "" happy hunting . "" on top , the suit ended in a collar of threaded copper onto which the metal helmet was screwed . three holes , protected by heavy glass , allowed us to see in any direction with simply a turn of the head inside the sphere . placed on our backs , the rouquayrol device went into operation as soon as it was in position , and for my part , i could breathe with ease .",95
""" only three or four days ago the impertinent jackanapes gave me his bill , and i was forced to turn both him and his bill out of the door ; so that i am here something in the fashion of a conqueror , holding my position , as it were , my conquest .",46
""" surely , but in extracting that silver , your expenses would outweigh your profits . here , by contrast , i have only to pick up what other men have lost , and not only in this bay of vigo but at a thousand other sites where ships have gone down , whose positions are marked on my underwater chart . do you understand now that i 'm rich to the tune of billions ? """,54
"the engineer 's orders were obeyed , and while the reporter and the lad , the best marksmen in the colony , posted themselves in a good position , but out of the monkeys ' sight , neb , pencroft , and cyrus climbed the plateau and entered the forest in order to kill some game , for it was now time for breakfast and they had no provisions remaining .",27
""" all right , at noon we 'll find out what our position is ! """,12
"miss eyre , draw your chair still a little farther forward : you are yet too far back ; i can not see you without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair , which i have no mind to do . """,27
"by then all our past sufferings were forgotten . the memory of that imprisonment under the ice faded from our minds . we had thoughts only of the future . captain nemo no longer appeared , neither in the lounge nor on the platform . the positions reported each day on the world map were put there by the chief officer , and they enabled me to determine the nautilus 's exact heading . now then , that evening it became obvious , much to my satisfaction , that we were returning north by the atlantic route .",46
"but the next day , by taking the exact hour of the rising and setting of the sun , and by marking its position between this rising and setting , he reckoned to fix the north of the island exactly , for , in consequence of its situation in the southern hemisphere , the sun , at the precise moment of its culmination , passed in the north and not in the south , as , in its apparent movement , it seems to do , to those places situated in the northern hemisphere .",23
""" what is it ? "" i asked , in a sitting position .",12
"by then we had fared nearly 13,000 leagues from our starting point in the pacific high seas . our position fix placed us in latitude 45 degrees 37 ' south and longitude 37 degrees 53 ' west . these were the same waterways where captain denham , aboard the herald , payed out 14,000 meters of sounding line without finding bottom . it was here too that lieutenant parker , aboard the american frigate congress , was unable to reach the underwater soil at 15,149 meters .",19
""" i think , "" answered the engineer , "" that the combat will now take a new form , for it can not be supposed that the convicts will be so foolish as to remain in a position so unfavorable for them ! """,38
"the next day , february 7 , we entered the strait of bab el mandeb , whose name means "" gate of tears "" in the arabic language . twenty miles wide , it 's only fifty - two kilometers long , and with the nautilus launched at full speed , clearing it was the work of barely an hour . but i did n't see a thing , not even perim island where the british government built fortifications to strengthen aden 's position . there were many english and french steamers plowing this narrow passageway , liners going from suez to bombay , calcutta , melbourne , réunion island , and mauritius ; far too much traffic for the nautilus to make an appearance on the surface . so it wisely stayed in midwater .",83
"it was a library . tall , black - rosewood bookcases , inlaid with copperwork , held on their wide shelves a large number of uniformly bound books . these furnishings followed the contours of the room , their lower parts leading to huge couches upholstered in maroon leather and curved for maximum comfort . light , movable reading stands , which could be pushed away or pulled near as desired , allowed books to be positioned on them for easy study . in the center stood a huge table covered with pamphlets , among which some newspapers , long out of date , were visible . electric light flooded this whole harmonious totality , falling from four frosted half globes set in the scrollwork of the ceiling . i stared in genuine wonderment at this room so ingeniously laid out , and i could n't believe my eyes .",76
