"it was just at high - water when these people came on shore ; and while they rambled about to see what kind of a place they were in , they had carelessly stayed till the tide was spent , and the water was ebbed considerably away , leaving their boat aground . they had left two men in the boat , who , as i found afterwards , having drunk a little too much brandy , fell asleep ; however , one of them waking a little sooner than the other and finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it , hallooed out for the rest , who were straggling about : upon which they all soon came to the boat : but it was past all their strength to launch her , the boat being very heavy , and the shore on that side being a soft oozy sand , almost like a quicksand . in this condition , like true seamen , who are , perhaps , the least of all mankind given to forethought , they gave it over , and away they strolled about the country again ; and i heard one of them say aloud to another , calling them off from the boat , “ why , let her alone , jack , ca n’t you ? she ’ll float next tide ; ” by which i was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of what countrymen they were .",129
"i say 150 meters , although i had no instruments for estimating this distance . but i knew that the sun 's rays , even in the clearest seas , could reach no deeper . so at precisely this point the darkness became profound . not a single object was visible past ten paces . consequently , i had begun to grope my way when suddenly i saw the glow of an intense white light . captain nemo had just activated his electric device . his companion did likewise . conseil and i followed suit . by turning a switch , i established contact between the induction coil and the glass spiral , and the sea , lit up by our four lanterns , was illuminated for a radius of twenty - five meters .",51
"at half - past eight the door opened , the policeman appeared , and , requesting them to follow him , led the way to an adjoining hall . it was evidently a court - room , and a crowd of europeans and natives already occupied the rear of the apartment .",3
""" then i think i shall go to bed , for it is past twelve o'clock ; but you may call me if you want anything in the night . """,13
""" you seem to be a walking calendar of crime , "" said stamford with a laugh . "" you might start a paper on those lines . call it the ' police news of the past . ' """,36
"on thursday , at 8 a.m. , we started afresh . the granite tunnel winding from side to side , earned us past unexpected turns , and seemed almost to form a labyrinth ; but , on the whole , its direction seemed to be south - easterly . my uncle never ceased to consult his compass , to keep account of the ground gone over .",22
"and there is another thing which surprised me ; i find , in settling accounts with the housekeeper , that a lunch , consisting of bread and cheese , has twice been served out to the girls during the past fortnight . how is this ?",39
"we were a little uneasy , however , when we found it snowed one whole day and a night so fast that we could not travel ; but he bid us be easy ; we should soon be past it all : we found , indeed , that we began to descend every day , and to come more north than before ; and so , depending upon our guide , we went on .",38
"our lights produced a thousand delightful effects while playing over these brightly colored boughs . i fancied i saw these cylindrical , membrane - filled tubes trembling beneath the water 's undulations . i was tempted to gather their fresh petals , which were adorned with delicate tentacles , some newly in bloom , others barely opened , while nimble fish with fluttering fins brushed past them like flocks of birds . but if my hands came near the moving flowers of these sensitive , lively creatures , an alarm would instantly sound throughout the colony . the white petals retracted into their red sheaths , the flowers vanished before my eyes , and the bush changed into a chunk of stony nipples .",65
"however ill the king might sleep , m. de treville slept still worse . he had ordered his three musketeers and their companion to be with him at half past six in the morning .",29
"at this locality we stood in the center of a huge clearing surrounded by the tall tree forms of this underwater forest . our lamps cast a sort of brilliant twilight over the area , making inordinately long shadows on the seafloor . past the boundaries of the clearing , the darkness deepened again , relieved only by little sparkles given off by the sharp crests of coral .",43
"the wind shook some blossoms from the trees , and the heavy lilac - blooms , with their clustering stars , moved to and fro in the languid air . a grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall , and like a blue thread a long thin dragon - fly floated past on its brown gauze wings . lord henry felt as if he could hear basil hallward 's heart beating , and wondered what was coming .",51
"at half - past five the little band arrived at the precipice , and a short time after at the chimneys .",3
"d’artagnan , who for an hour past had been gnawing his nails with impatience , was beginning to attack the quick .",6
"they were playing together , as usual , when seven o’clock sounded ; the patrol was heard passing to double the posts . at half past seven the retreat was sounded .",25
"i confess that i was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the practical nature of my companion 's theories . my respect for his powers of analysis increased wondrously . there still remained some lurking suspicion in my mind , however , that the whole thing was a pre - arranged episode , intended to dazzle me , though what earthly object he could have in taking me in was past my comprehension . when i looked at him he had finished reading the note , and his eyes had assumed the vacant , lack - lustre expression which showed mental abstraction .",71
"in the midst of the watery mass , brightly lit by our electric beams , there snaked past those one - meter lampreys that are common to nearly every clime . a type of ray from the genus oxyrhynchus , five feet wide , had a white belly with a spotted , ash - gray back and was carried along by the currents like a huge , wide - open shawl . other rays passed by so quickly i could n't tell if they deserved that name "" eagle ray "" coined by the ancient greeks , or those designations of "" rat ray , "" "" bat ray , "" and "" toad ray "" that modern fishermen have inflicted on them . dogfish known as topes , twelve feet long and especially feared by divers , were racing with each other . looking like big bluish shadows , thresher sharks went by , eight feet long and gifted with an extremely acute sense of smell . dorados from the genus sparus , some measuring up to thirteen decimeters , appeared in silver and azure costumes encircled with ribbons , which contrasted with the dark color of their fins ; fish sacred to the goddess venus , their eyes set in brows of gold ; a valuable species that patronizes all waters fresh or salt , equally at home in rivers , lakes , and oceans , living in every clime , tolerating any temperature , their line dating back to prehistoric times on this earth yet preserving all its beauty from those far - off days . magnificent sturgeons , nine to ten meters long and extremely fast , banged their powerful tails against the glass of our panels , showing bluish backs with small brown spots ; they resemble sharks , without equaling their strength , and are encountered in every sea ; in the spring they delight in swimming up the great rivers , fighting the currents of the volga , danube , po , rhine , loire , and oder , while feeding on herring , mackerel , salmon , and codfish ; although they belong to the class of cartilaginous fish , they rate as a delicacy ; they 're eaten fresh , dried , marinated , or salt - preserved , and in olden times they were borne in triumph to the table of the roman epicure lucullus . but whenever the nautilus drew near the surface , those denizens of the mediterranean i could observe most productively belonged to the sixty - third genus of bony fish . these were tuna from the genus scomber , blue - black on top , silver on the belly armor , their dorsal stripes giving off a golden gleam . they are said to follow ships in search of refreshing shade from the hot tropical sun , and they did just that with the nautilus , as they had once done with the vessels of the count de la pérouse . for long hours they competed in speed with our submersible . i could n't stop marveling at these animals so perfectly cut out for racing , their heads small , their bodies sleek , spindle - shaped , and in some cases over three meters long , their pectoral fins gifted with remarkable strength , their caudal fins forked . like certain flocks of birds , whose speed they equal , these tuna swim in triangle formation , which prompted the ancients to say they 'd boned up on geometry and military strategy . and yet they ca n't escape the provençal fishermen , who prize them as highly as did the ancient inhabitants of turkey and italy ; and these valuable animals , as oblivious as if they were deaf and blind , leap right into the marseilles tuna nets and perish by the thousands .",17
"it was past midnight ; the next thing was to find planchet . d’artagnan went successively into all the cabarets in which there was a light , but could not find planchet in any of them .",2
""" yes , my boy , "" i replied , "" it cuts across the whole strait of sicily , and smith 's soundings prove that in the past , these two continents were genuinely connected between cape boeo and cape farina . """,28
"when this crisis was past , when milady appeared to have resumed her self - possession , which she had never lost ; when felton had seen her recover with the veil of chastity those treasures of love which were only concealed from him to make him desire them the more ardently , he said , "" ah , now !",4
