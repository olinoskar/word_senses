"this was a misfortune . mr . fogg , in order not to deviate from his course , furled his sails and increased the force of the steam ; but the vessel 's speed slackened , owing to the state of the sea , the long waves of which broke against the stern . she pitched violently , and this retarded her progress . the breeze little by little swelled into a tempest , and it was to be feared that the henrietta might not be able to maintain herself upright on the waves .","('sail', 'voile', 'velar')",0,20,0
