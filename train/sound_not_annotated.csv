hardly was he concealed when the little bell sounded .,8

"what ! a novice not worship her priest ! that sounds blasphemous . """,10
"fix did not have the same thoughts , and could scarcely conceal his agitation . he walked feverishly up and down the platform , but soon resumed his outward composure . he now saw the folly of which he had been guilty in letting fogg go alone . what ! this man , whom he had just followed around the world , was permitted now to separate himself from him ! he began to accuse and abuse himself , and , as if he were director of police , administered to himself a sound lecture for his greenness .",93
"this woman exercised over him an unaccountable power ; he hated and adored her at the same time . he would not have believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart , and by their union constitute a passion so strange , and as it were , diabolical . presently it sounded one o’clock .",55
"the next day ayrton awoke from his torpor , and his companions cordially manifested all the joy they felt , on seeing him again , almost safe and sound , after a hundred and four days separation .",28
"he examined him , and found him sound and without blemish .",7
"but how had i left the course of the stream ? for it was a terrible fact that it no longer ran at my side . then i understood the reason of that fearful , silence , when for the last time i listened to hear if any sound from my companions could reach my ears . at the moment when i left the right road i had not noticed the absence of the stream . it is evident that at that moment a deviation had presented itself before me , whilst the hansbach , following the caprice of another incline , had gone with my companions away into unknown depths .",48
"at the moment when he was about to retire , she was cheered with a ray of hope , for she thought he was about to speak ; but his lips moved without any sound leaving his mouth , and making a powerful effort to control himself , he sent back to his heart the words that were about to escape from his lips , and went out .",34
"it was long past noon when he awoke . his valet had crept several times on tiptoe into the room to see if he was stirring , and had wondered what made his young master sleep so late . finally his bell sounded , and victor came in softly with a cup of tea , and a pile of letters , on a small tray of old sevres china , and drew back the olive - satin curtains , with their shimmering blue lining , that hung in front of the three tall windows .",42
"at the denunciating sound , the monks would be rendered aware that temptation was besieging a brother , and all the community would go to prayers .",3
"a few minutes before nine o'clock , i glued my ear to the captain 's door . not a sound . i left my stateroom and returned to the lounge , which was deserted and plunged in near darkness .",19
""" jane is not such a weakling as you would make her , "" he would say : "" she can bear a mountain blast , or a shower , or a few flakes of snow , as well as any of us . her constitution is both sound and elastic;--better calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust . """,48
"from every enjoyment i was , of course , excluded : my share of the gaiety consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of eliza and georgiana , and seeing them descend to the drawing - room , dressed out in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes , with hair elaborately ringletted ; and afterwards , in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played below , to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman , to the jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed , to the broken hum of conversation as the drawing - room door opened and closed .",59
"in its interior i heard the sound of footsteps and muffled voices . but captain nemo did n't appear . just as i was about to leave the lounge , ned land and conseil entered .",6
"at seven o'clock the log told me that the nautilus had reduced speed . i realized that it was letting the warship approach . moreover , the explosions grew more intensely audible . shells furrowed the water around us , drilling through it with an odd hissing sound .",47
"i tried to speak aloud , but hoarse sounds alone passed my dry lips . i panted for breath .",8
"already i was feeling the approach of another faint , and was hoping for complete annihilation , when a loud noise reached me . it was like the distant rumble of continuous thunder , and i could hear its sounding undulations rolling far away into the remote recesses of the abyss .",39
"suddenly my ear , resting by chance against the wall , caught , or seemed to catch , certain vague , indescribable , distant , articulate sounds , as of words .",26
"an enormous mass was sinking beneath the waters , and the nautilus , missing none of its death throes , was descending into the depths with it . ten meters away , i could see its gaping hull , into which water was rushing with a sound of thunder , then its double rows of cannons and railings . its deck was covered with dark , quivering shadows .",46
"i listened , i watched in the darkness for an answer , a cry , a mere breath of sound , but nothing came . some minutes passed . a whole world of ideas had opened in my mind . i thought that my weakened voice could never penetrate to my companions .",19
"my first impulse was to tell sir henry all my plans . my second and wisest one is to play my own game and speak as little as possible to anyone . he is silent and distrait . his nerves have been strangely shaken by that sound upon the moor . i will say nothing to add to his anxieties , but i will take my own steps to attain my own end .",46
"then i understood it all . to make myself heard , i must speak along this wall , which would conduct the sound of my voice just as wire conducts electricity .",22
the wall which harding struck with the hilt of his cutlass sounded solid .,11
outside could be heard the howling of the wind and the monotonous sound of the surf breaking on the shore .,12
"i waited with the deepest anxiety . sound does not travel with great velocity . even increased density air has no effect upon its rate of travelling ; it merely augments its intensity . seconds , which seemed ages , passed away , and at last these words reached me :",7
"rance resumed his seat , without however losing his mystified expression . "" i went back to the gate and sounded my whistle . that brought murcher and two more to the spot . """,20
"now , one evening when d’artagnan , who was in the trenches , was not able to accompany them , athos , porthos , and aramis , mounted on their battle steeds , enveloped in their war cloaks , with their hands upon their pistol butts , were returning from a drinking place called the red dovecot , which athos had discovered two days before upon the route to jarrie , following the road which led to the camp and quite on their guard , as we have stated , for fear of an ambuscade , when , about a quarter of a league from the village of boisnau , they fancied they heard the sound of horses approaching them . they immediately all three halted , closed in , and waited , occupying the middle of the road . in an instant , and as the moon broke from behind a cloud , they saw at a turning of the road two horsemen who , on perceiving them , stopped in their turn , appearing to deliberate whether they should continue their route or go back .",115
"on closer examination , you detected something in his face that displeased , or rather that failed to please . his features were regular , but too relaxed : his eye was large and well cut , but the life looking out of it was a tame , vacant life -- at least so i thought . the sound of the dressing - bell dispersed the party .",58
". . . . "" forty seconds , "" said my uncle . "" forty seconds between the two words ; so the sound takes twenty seconds in coming . now , at the rate of 1,120 feet in a second , this is 22,400 feet , or four miles and a quarter , nearly . """,23
"what was he doing just then ? i listened at the door to his stateroom . i heard the sound of footsteps . captain nemo was inside . he had n't gone to bed . with his every movement i imagined he would appear and ask me why i wanted to escape ! i felt in a perpetual state of alarm . my imagination magnified this sensation . the feeling became so acute , i wondered whether it would n't be better to enter the captain 's stateroom , dare him face to face , brave it out with word and deed !",19
"these remembrances came into my mind , and i clearly saw that since my uncle 's voice really reached me , there could be no obstacle between us . following the direction by which the sound came , of course i should arrive in his presence , if my strength did not fail me .",35
"we all three fell down flat . in less than a second we were in deep , unfathomable darkness . then i felt as if not only myself but the raft also had no support beneath . i thought it was sinking ; but it was not so . i wanted to speak to my uncle , but the roaring of the waves prevented him from hearing even the sound of my voice .",69
""" women are not always allowed a choice , "" he answered , but hardly had he finished the sentence before from the far end of the conservatory came a stifled groan , followed by the dull sound of a heavy fall . everybody started up . the duchess stood motionless in horror . and with fear in his eyes , lord henry rushed through the flapping palms to find dorian gray lying face downwards on the tiled floor in a deathlike swoon .",37
"as i spoke , i tried to sound more confident than i really felt . meanwhile the nautilus accelerated its backward movement , and running with propeller in reverse , it swept us along at great speed .",7
"the violins began to sound with all their might , but nobody listened to them .",4
""" and these are some new breed of sounding line ? """,8
i might be questioned : i could give no answer but what would sound incredible and excite suspicion .,13
eleven o’clock sounded from all the clocks of the faubourg st . germain . it was delightful weather .,2
""" they 're thermometric sounding lines that report water temperatures in the different strata . """,4
"three o'clock then sounded . the harbor pilot went down into his dinghy and rejoined a little schooner waiting for him to leeward . the furnaces were stoked ; the propeller churned the waves more swiftly ; the frigate skirted the flat , yellow coast of long island ; and at eight o'clock in the evening , after the lights of fire island had vanished into the northwest , we ran at full steam onto the dark waters of the atlantic .",3
""" no high - sounding words ! let us sit down and chat quietly , as brother and sister ought to do . """,4
"he had n't finished speaking when a cracking sound occurred . the nuts gave way , and ripped out of its socket , the skiff was hurled like a stone from a sling into the midst of the vortex .",8
"as for my account of this excursion under the waters , i 'm well aware that it sounds incredible ! i 'm the chronicler of deeds seemingly impossible and yet incontestably real . this was no fantasy . this was what i saw and felt !",17
"it was close upon nine when he set out . i had no idea how long he might be , but i sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages of henri murger 's "" vie de bohème . "" ten o'clock passed , and i heard the footsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed . eleven , and the more stately tread of the landlady passed my door , bound for the same destination . it was close upon twelve before i heard the sharp sound of his latch - key . the instant he entered i saw by his face that he had not been successful . amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the mastery , until the former suddenly carried the day , and he burst into a hearty laugh .",92
"they traversed these somber galleries , waving lighted torches ; they examined the smallest excavations ; they sounded the shallowest depths , but all was dark and silent .",17
""" i have a question to ask you . you say that i am safe and sound ? """,16
"endowed doubtless with sight which enabled him to pierce the obscurity , he was always in the thick of the fight uttering from time to time -- a sharp hissing sound , which was with him the sign of great rejoicing .",30
"captain nemo went out . hissing sounds soon told me that water was being admitted into the ballast tanks . the nautilus slowly settled and rested on the icy bottom at a depth of 350 meters , the depth at which the lower shelf of ice lay submerged .",6
"and perhaps , my god ! "" added he , with that misanthropic tone which was peculiar to him , "" perhaps sooner than you wish . "" half past seven had sounded .",32
""" that sounds a dangerous maxim , sir ; because one can see at once that it is liable to abuse . """,2
"but time was passing away ; night came on ; the street noises ceased ; my uncle , bending over his task , noticed nothing , not even martha half opening the door ; he heard not a sound , not even that excellent woman saying :",38
"it was ayrton , slightly wounded in the shoulder , and pencroft , safe and sound , whom their friends received with open arms .",15
"still we kept descending . it seemed to me that the falling stones were meeting with an earlier resistance , and that the concussion gave a more abrupt and deadened sound .",30
"his action was alternately vivacious and sullen . his voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision ( when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance ) to that species of energetic concision — that abrupt , weighty , unhurried , and hollow - sounding enunciation — that leaden , self - balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance , which may be observed in the lost drunkard , or the irreclaimable eater of opium , during the periods of his most intense excitement .",43
"he suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses ; the most insipid food was alone endurable ; he could wear only garments of certain texture ; the odors of all flowers were oppressive ; his eyes were tortured by even a faint light ; and there were but peculiar sounds , and these from stringed instruments , which did not inspire him with horror .",51
"despite the buzzing in my head , i soon could hear vibrations under the nautilus 's hull . we tilted . the ice cracked with an odd ripping sound , like paper tearing , and the nautilus began settling downward .",28
"his eye fell on the yellow book that lord henry had sent him . what was it , he wondered . he went towards the little , pearl - coloured octagonal stand that had always looked to him like the work of some strange egyptian bees that wrought in silver , and taking up the volume , flung himself into an arm - chair and began to turn over the leaves . after a few minutes he became absorbed . it was the strangest book that he had ever read . it seemed to him that in exquisite raiment , and to the delicate sound of flutes , the sins of the world were passing in dumb show before him . things that he had dimly dreamed of were suddenly made real to him . things of which he had never dreamed were gradually revealed .",104
""" s’blood ! "" cried he to d’artagnan , "" do not kill him , young man , i beg of you . i have an old affair to settle with him when i am cured and sound again .",37
"i saw by his look , when he turned to me , that they were always written on the air between me and him ; whenever i spoke , they sounded in my voice to his ear , and their echo toned every answer he gave me .",30
"they stopped to listen , but no sound arose above the roaring of the waves and the dashing of the surf .",7
"at last the guard returned ; once more i was stowed away in the coach , my protector mounted his own seat , sounded his hollow horn , and away we rattled over the "" stony street "" of l- .",23
"during those nineteen days just mentioned , no unique incidents distinguished our voyage . i saw little of the captain . he was at work . in the library i often found books he had left open , especially books on natural history . he had thumbed through my work on the great ocean depths , and the margins were covered with his notes , which sometimes contradicted my theories and formulations . but the captain remained content with this method of refining my work , and he rarely discussed it with me . sometimes i heard melancholy sounds reverberating from the organ , which he played very expressively , but only at night in the midst of the most secretive darkness , while the nautilus slumbered in the wilderness of the ocean .",98
"some big dogfish also passed by , a voracious species of shark if there ever was one . with some justice , fishermen 's yarns are n't to be trusted , but here 's what a few of them relate . inside the corpse of one of these animals there were found a buffalo head and a whole calf ; in another , two tuna and a sailor in uniform ; in yet another , a soldier with his saber ; in another , finally , a horse with its rider . in candor , none of these sounds like divinely inspired truth . but the fact remains that not a single dogfish let itself get caught in the nautilus 's nets , so i ca n't vouch for their voracity .",98
"at noon that day after our position fix , captain nemo climbed onto the platform , where i happened to be . i vowed not to let him go below again without at least sounding him out on his future plans . as soon as he saw me , he came over , graciously offered me a cigar , and said to me :",34
our navigating continued under these conditions until march 13 . that day the nautilus was put to work in some depth - sounding experiments that fascinated me deeply .,22
"however , near midnight it disappeared , or to use a more appropriate expression , "" it went out , "" like a huge glowworm . had it fled from us ? we were duty bound to fear so rather than hope so . but at 12:53 in the morning , a deafening hiss became audible , resembling the sound made by a waterspout expelled with tremendous intensity .",59
"by then we had fared nearly 13,000 leagues from our starting point in the pacific high seas . our position fix placed us in latitude 45 degrees 37 ' south and longitude 37 degrees 53 ' west . these were the same waterways where captain denham , aboard the herald , payed out 14,000 meters of sounding line without finding bottom . it was here too that lieutenant parker , aboard the american frigate congress , was unable to reach the underwater soil at 15,149 meters .",56
"i hardly know whether i had slept or not after this musing ; at any rate , i started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur , peculiar and lugubrious , which sounded , i thought , just above me .",32
"i wished i had kept my candle burning : the night was drearily dark ; my spirits were depressed . i rose and sat up in bed , listening . the sound was hushed .",31
""" captain , "" said felton , "" this is the person of whom i spoke to you , and whom you must convey safe and sound to france . """,26
"the head of my bed was near the door , and i thought at first the goblin - laugher stood at my bedside -- or rather , crouched by my pillow : but i rose , looked round , and could see nothing ; while , as i still gazed , the unnatural sound was reiterated : and i knew it came from behind the panels .",53
"five and seven said nothing , but looked at two . two began in a low voice , ' why the fact is , you see , miss , this here ought to have been a red rose - tree , and we put a white one in by mistake ; and if the queen was to find it out , we should all have our heads cut off , you know . so you see , miss , we 're doing our best , afore she comes , to-- ' at this moment five , who had been anxiously looking across the garden , called out ' the queen ! the queen !

""" i hope so , monsieur fix . you see , a man of sound sense ought not to spend his life jumping from a steamer upon a railway train , and from a railway train upon a steamer again , pretending to make the tour of the world in eighty days ! no ; all these gymnastics , you may be sure , will cease at bombay . """,14
"we stood stock - still , not knowing what surprise was waiting for us , whether pleasant or unpleasant . but a sliding sound became audible . you could tell that some panels were shifting over the nautilus 's sides .",23
"and the sailor sounded with a long cord , which served him as a lead - line , and to which was fastened a lump of iron .",3
"midnight sounded , and almost at the same time the bell was rung in milady ’s chamber .",1
"making a sign to la houdiniere and cahusac to stop , he alighted from his horse , and went toward these suspected merry companions , hoping , by means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge which concealed his approach , to catch some words of this conversation which appeared so interesting . at ten paces from the hedge he recognized the talkative gascon ; and as he had already perceived that these men were musketeers , he did not doubt that the three others were those called the inseparables ; that is to say , athos , porthos , and aramis .",35

"meanwhile the night advanced , and it was perhaps two hours from morning , when pencroft , then sound asleep , was vigorously shaken .",18
"in the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the sierra blanco . as far as the eye can reach stretches the great flat plain - land , all dusted over with patches of alkali , and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes . on the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks , with their rugged summits flecked with snow . in this great stretch of country there is no sign of life , nor of anything appertaining to life . there is no bird in the steel - blue heaven , no movement upon the dull , grey earth — above all , there is absolute silence . listen as one may , there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness ; nothing but silence — complete and heart - subduing silence . it has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain . that is hardly true . looking down from the sierra blanco , one sees a pathway traced out across the desert , which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance . it is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers . here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun , and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali . approach , and examine them ! they are bones : some large and coarse , others smaller and more delicate . the former have belonged to oxen , and the latter to men . for fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside .",137

"its fishing finished , the nautilus drew nearer to the coast . in this locality a number of sea turtles were sleeping on the surface of the waves . it would have been difficult to capture these valuable reptiles , because they wake up at the slightest sound , and their solid carapaces are harpoon - proof . but our suckerfish would effect their capture with extraordinary certainty and precision . in truth , this animal is a living fishhook , promising wealth and happiness to the greenest fisherman in the business .",47

"phileas fogg had not concealed from sir francis his design of going round the world , nor the circumstances under which he set out ; and the general only saw in the wager a useless eccentricity and a lack of sound common sense . in the way this strange gentleman was going on , he would leave the world without having done any good to himself or anybody else .",40

"it was obvious these papuans had already entered into relations with europeans and knew their ships . but this long , iron cylinder lying in the bay , with no masts or funnels -- what were they to make of it ? nothing good , because at first they kept it at a respectful distance . however , seeing that it stayed motionless , they regained confidence little by little and tried to become more familiar with it . now then , it was precisely this familiarity that we needed to prevent . since our weapons made no sound when they went off , they would have only a moderate effect on these islanders , who reputedly respect nothing but noisy mechanisms . without thunderclaps , lightning bolts would be much less frightening , although the danger lies in the flash , not the noise .",98

"i sounded all the walls , in the hopes of discovering a door , but everywhere the walls returned a full and flat sound .",1
"i sounded all the walls , in the hopes of discovering a door , but everywhere the walls returned a full and flat sound .",23
"what was that ? in the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound — low , but very distinct in the quiet of the night . it came from the door of the house . ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently . there was a pause for a few moments , and then the low insidious sound was repeated . someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the panels of the door . was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal ? or was it some agent who was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived . john ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook his nerves and chilled his heart . springing forward he drew the bolt and threw the door open .",58
"the other , who was safe and sound , continued his way toward the camp .",7
"as she grew up , a sound english education corrected in a great measure her french defects ; and when she left school , i found in her a pleasing and obliging companion : docile , good - tempered , and well - principled .",6
"the bolts were drawn ; the door groaned upon its hinges . steps sounded in the chamber , and drew near .",13
there were days when she was quite silent ; but there were others when i could not account for the sounds she made .,20
"a few hours passed away . a deep silence reigned around us , the silence of the grave . no sound could reach us through walls , the thinnest of which were five miles thick .",20
""" excellent , "" replied captain bjarne ; "" a sou'-easter . we shall pass down the sound full speed , with all sails set . """,17
""" you disturb me ? oh , quite the contrary , dear friend , i swear ; and as a proof of what i say , permit me to declare i am rejoiced to see you safe and sound . """,38
"the dog came bounding back , and seeing his master in a predicament , and hearing the horse groan , barked till the evening hills echoed the sound , which was deep in proportion to his magnitude .",27
"while i gazed , this fissure rapidly widened — there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind — the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sight — my brain reeled as i saw the mighty walls rushing asunder — there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters — and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the “ house of usher . ”",49
patrick soon caught the sound of his master ’s voice calling his falcon .,4
"he steals softly over the grass , careful to make no sound ; he pauses -- fancying she has stirred : he withdraws : not for worlds would he be seen .",11
"the traveller now , stooping , felt his foot and leg , as if trying whether they were sound ; apparently something ailed them , for he halted to the stile whence i had just risen , and sat down . i was in the mood for being useful , or at least officious , i think , for i now drew near him again .",18
"we started a stag of ten branches . we chased him for six hours , and when he was near being taken -- when st.-simon was already putting his horn to his mouth to sound the mort -- crack , all the pack takes the wrong scent and sets off after a two - year - older .",34
"then i began to hear distinctly quite a new sound of something running within the thickness of the granite wall , a kind of dull , dead rumbling , like distant thunder . during the first part of our walk , not meeting with the promised spring , i felt my agony returning ; but then my uncle acquainted me with the cause of the strange noise .",9
"felton listened without uttering any word or sound , except an inward expression of agony . the sweat streamed down his marble forehead , and his hand , under his coat , tore his breast .",7
"i can now conjecture readily that this streak of light was , in all likelihood , a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn : but then , prepared as my mind was for horror , shaken as my nerves were by agitation , i thought the swift darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world . my heart beat thick , my head grew hot ; a sound filled my ears , which i deemed the rushing of wings ; something seemed near me ; i was oppressed , suffocated : endurance broke down ; i rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort .",76
they were in a frame of mind to imagine anything or expect anything . they listened eagerly for sounds outside .,18
"besides these sounds , the presence of chemical combinations was soon betrayed by their powerful odor , and the engineer and his companion were almost suffocated by sulphurous vapors .",2
"we had been gone from the nautilus for about an hour and a half . it was almost noon . i spotted this fact in the perpendicularity of the sun 's rays , which were no longer refracted . the magic of these solar colors disappeared little by little , with emerald and sapphire shades vanishing from our surroundings altogether . we walked with steady steps that rang on the seafloor with astonishing intensity . the tiniest sounds were transmitted with a speed to which the ear is unaccustomed on shore . in fact , water is a better conductor of sound than air , and under the waves noises carry four times as fast .",101
"a small fly or moth had fluttered across our path , and in an instant stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it . to my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire , and my acquaintance never paused for an instant , bounding from tuft to tuft behind it , his green net waving in the air . his gray clothes and jerky , zigzag , irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself . i was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the treacherous mire , when i heard the sound of steps , and turning round found a woman near me upon the path . she had come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of merripit house , but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close .",116
eleven o’clock sounded .,2
"i heard voices , too , speaking with a hollow sound , and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water : agitation , uncertainty , and an all - predominating sense of terror confused my faculties .",10
"lady ruxton glanced at him curiously . "" you must come and explain that to me some afternoon , lord henry . it sounds a fascinating theory , "" she murmured , as she swept out of the room .",23
"the reporter and pencroft , halting at any suspicious sound , advanced with great caution .",9
they were therefore much astonished and delighted in the regiment when they saw the young man come back safe and sound .,20
""" there was not a soul to be seen , nor a sound to be heard , except the dripping of the rain . when i looked in at the window , i found drebber all huddled together in a drunken sleep . i shook him by the arm , ' it 's time to get out , ' i said .",12
"i was forgetting that it was night . the chronometer soon informed me of that fact ; and in a very short time , refreshed and thankful , we all three fell into a sound sleep .",34
the bell of the convent gate was sounded ; milady was not mistaken .,7
"the two great barrels , hermetically sealed , but which sounded hollow and empty , were fastened to its sides by strong ropes , knotted with a skill which pencroft directly pronounced sailors alone could exhibit .",10
"our lights produced a thousand delightful effects while playing over these brightly colored boughs . i fancied i saw these cylindrical , membrane - filled tubes trembling beneath the water 's undulations . i was tempted to gather their fresh petals , which were adorned with delicate tentacles , some newly in bloom , others barely opened , while nimble fish with fluttering fins brushed past them like flocks of birds . but if my hands came near the moving flowers of these sensitive , lively creatures , an alarm would instantly sound throughout the colony . the white petals retracted into their red sheaths , the flowers vanished before my eyes , and the bush changed into a chunk of stony nipples .",92
not a sound could be heard inside the palisade .,2
"a cold rain began to fall , and the blurred street - lamps looked ghastly in the dripping mist . the public- houses were just closing , and dim men and women were clustering in broken groups round their doors . from some of the bars came the sound of horrible laughter . in others , drunkards brawled and screamed .",48
"then i heard the sound of footsteps on the platform . i realized that the skiff was being detached and launched to sea . for an instant it bumped the nautilus 's side , then all sounds ceased .",36
""" hey , herbert ! how capital it sounds !",8
"the guests having eaten the soup , were about to lift the first glass of wine to their lips , when all at once the cannon sounded from fort louis and fort neuf . the guardsmen , imagining this to be caused by some unexpected attack , either of the besieged or the english , sprang to their swords . d’artagnan , not less forward than they , did likewise , and all ran out , in order to repair to their posts .",26
"and yet it may seem a small matter in itself . you are aware that i am not a very sound sleeper , and since i have been on guard in this house my slumbers have been lighter than ever . last night , about two in the morning , i was aroused by a stealthy step passing my room . i rose , opened my door , and peeped out . a long black shadow was trailing down the corridor . it was thrown by a man who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in his hand . he was in shirt and trousers , with no covering to his feet . i could merely see the outline , but his height told me that it was barrymore . he walked very slowly and circumspectly , and there was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole appearance .",20
"not a sound could penetrate into it , even the thunder peals could not pierce its thick sides .",2
""" ' this life , ' said i at last , ' is hell : this is the air -- those are the sounds of the bottomless pit !",23
"hoarse sounds issued from his throat between his teeth , which were sharp as the teeth of a wild beast made to tear raw flesh .",1
a frightful sound was heard .,2
"but at the moment the glass touched her lips , her hand remained suspended ; she heard something on the road which sounded like the rattling of a distant gallop . then it grew nearer , and it seemed to her , almost at the same time , that she heard the neighing of horses .",22
"' digging for apples , indeed ! ' said the rabbit angrily . ' here ! come and help me out of this ! ' ( sounds of more broken glass . )",26
"barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against the glass . his profile was half turned towards me , and his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the moor . for some minutes he stood watching intently . then he gave a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light . instantly i made my way back to my room , and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing once more upon their return journey . long afterwards when i had fallen into a light sleep i heard a key turn somewhere in a lock , but i could not tell whence the sound came . what it all means i can not guess , but there is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of . i do not trouble you with my theories , for you asked me to furnish you only with facts . i have had a long talk with sir henry this morning , and we have made a plan of campaign founded upon my observations of last night . i will not speak about it just now , but it should make my next report interesting reading .",119
"there was a long silence after this , and alice could only hear whispers now and then ; such as , ' sure , i do n't like it , yer honour , at all , at all ! ' ' do as i tell you , you coward ! ' and at last she spread out her hand again , and made another snatch in the air . this time there were two little shrieks , and more sounds of broken glass . ' what a number of cucumber - frames there must be ! ' thought alice . ' i wonder what they 'll do next ! as for pulling me out of the window , i only wish they could ! i 'm sure i do n't want to stay in here any longer ! '",79
"for some days we saw a large number of aquatic birds with webbed feet , known as gulls or sea mews . some were skillfully slain , and when cooked in a certain fashion , they make a very acceptable platter of water game . among the great wind riders -- carried over long distances from every shore and resting on the waves from their exhausting flights-- i spotted some magnificent albatross , birds belonging to the longipennes ( long - winged ) family , whose discordant calls sound like the braying of an ass . the totipalmes ( fully webbed ) family was represented by swift frigate birds , nimbly catching fish at the surface , and by numerous tropic birds of the genus phaeton , among others the red - tailed tropic bird , the size of a pigeon , its white plumage shaded with pink tints that contrasted with its dark - hued wings .",88
it was as still as a church on a week - day : the pattering rain on the forest leaves was the only sound audible in its vicinage .,23
"they were playing together , as usual , when seven o’clock sounded ; the patrol was heard passing to double the posts . at half past seven the retreat was sounded .",11

"this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape ; so she set off at once , and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath , and till the puppy 's bark sounded quite faint in the distance .",37
"on january 25 , the ocean being completely deserted , the nautilus spent the day on the surface , churning the waves with its powerful propeller and making them spurt to great heights . under these conditions , who would n't have mistaken it for a gigantic cetacean ? i spent three - quarters of the day on the platform . i stared at the sea . nothing on the horizon , except near four o'clock in the afternoon a long steamer to the west , running on our opposite tack . its masting was visible for an instant , but it could n't have seen the nautilus because we were lying too low in the water . i imagine that steamboat belonged to the peninsular & oriental line , which provides service from the island of ceylon to sidney , also calling at king george sound and melbourne .",146
"a continual hissing sound issued from his lips , his aspect was wild , but he did not attempt to resist .",3
"i could observe these strange walls quite closely : our sounding lines indicated that they dropped perpendicularly for more than 300 meters , and our electric beams made the bright limestone positively sparkle .",10
