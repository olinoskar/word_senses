"a sudden pallor overspread the detective 's face . separate himself from the man whom he had so persistently followed step by step ! leave him to wander about in this desert ! fix gazed attentively at mr . fogg , and , despite his suspicions and of the struggle which was going on within him , he lowered his eyes before that calm and frank look .",63
"where formerly stretched the calm waters of the lake now appeared an enormous mass of smoking rocks , as if an upheaving of the soil had formed immense shoals .",4
"phileas fogg gazed at the tempestuous sea , which seemed to be struggling especially to delay him , with his habitual tranquillity . he never changed countenance for an instant , though a delay of twenty hours , by making him too late for the yokohama boat , would almost inevitably cause the loss of the wager . but this man of nerve manifested neither impatience nor annoyance ; it seemed as if the storm were a part of his programme , and had been foreseen . aouda was amazed to find him as calm as he had been from the first time she saw him .",94

"as usual , dinner was served me in my stateroom . full of anxiety , i ate little . i left the table at seven o'clock . 120 minutes-- i was keeping track of them -- still separated me from the moment i was to rejoin ned land . my agitation increased . my pulse was throbbing violently . i could n't stand still . i walked up and down , hoping to calm my troubled mind with movement . the possibility of perishing in our reckless undertaking was the least of my worries ; my heart was pounding at the thought that our plans might be discovered before we had left the nautilus , at the thought of being hauled in front of captain nemo and finding him angered , or worse , saddened by my deserting him .",73

"the prairie , across which the sledge was moving in a straight line , was as flat as a sea . it seemed like a vast frozen lake . the railroad which ran through this section ascended from the south - west to the north - west by great island , columbus , an important nebraska town , schuyler , and fremont , to omaha . it followed throughout the right bank of the platte river . the sledge , shortening this route , took a chord of the arc described by the railway . mudge was not afraid of being stopped by the platte river , because it was frozen . the road , then , was quite clear of obstacles , and phileas fogg had but two things to fear -- an accident to the sledge , and a change or calm in the wind .",143

"if a gust of wind swept the waste , i looked up , fearing it was the rush of a bull ; if a plover whistled , i imagined it a man . finding my apprehensions unfounded , however , and calmed by the deep silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall , i took confidence .",41

""" i know , "" he told me in that calm tone the most dreadful outlook could n't change . "" it 's one more danger , but i do n't know any way of warding it off . our sole chance for salvation is to work faster than the water solidifies . we 've got to get there first , that 's all . """,10

"and yet nobody prolonged his underwater work beyond the time allotted him . his shift over , each man surrendered to a gasping companion the air tank that would revive him . captain nemo set the example and was foremost in submitting to this strict discipline . when his time was up , he yielded his equipment to another and reentered the foul air on board , always calm , unflinching , and uncomplaining .",68
"but i tell you -- and you may mark my words -- you will come some day to a craggy pass in the channel , where the whole of life 's stream will be broken up into whirl and tumult , foam and noise : either you will be dashed to atoms on crag points , or lifted up and borne on by some master - wave into a calmer current -- as i am now .",69

"all on board feared that it could not be done , and every one -- phileas fogg , no doubt , excepted -- felt his heart beat with impatience . the boat must keep up an average of nine miles an hour , and the wind was becoming calmer every moment ! it was a capricious breeze , coming from the coast , and after it passed the sea became smooth . still , the tankadere was so light , and her fine sails caught the fickle zephyrs so well , that , with the aid of the currents john bunsby found himself at six o'clock not more than ten miles from the mouth of shanghai river . shanghai itself is situated at least twelve miles up the stream . at seven they were still three miles from shanghai . the pilot swore an angry oath ; the reward of two hundred pounds was evidently on the point of escaping him . he looked at mr . fogg . mr . fogg was perfectly tranquil ; and yet his whole fortune was at this moment at stake .",48

"after his first depression , passepartout became calmer , and began to study his situation . it was certainly not an enviable one . he found himself on the way to japan , and what should he do when he got there ? his pocket was empty ; he had not a solitary shilling , not so much as a penny . his passage had fortunately been paid for in advance ; and he had five or six days in which to decide upon his future course . he fell to at meals with an appetite , and ate for mr . fogg , aouda , and himself . he helped himself as generously as if japan were a desert , where nothing to eat was to be looked for .",7
the idea calmed me somewhat : i lay down .,2
""" i 'm unable to answer you , mr . land . and trust me on this : for the time being , get rid of these notions of taking over the nautilus or escaping from it . this boat is a masterpiece of modern technology , and i 'd be sorry to have missed it ! many people would welcome the circumstances that have been handed us , just to walk in the midst of these wonders . so keep calm , and let 's see what 's happening around us .

"the wind had now fallen almost to a calm , and the noise of the sea began also to subside .",8
"these wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the storm lasted , and indeed some time after ; but the next day the wind was abated , and the sea calmer , and i began to be a little inured to it ; however , i was very grave for all that day , being also a little sea - sick still ; but towards night the weather cleared up , the wind was quite over , and a charming fine evening followed ; the sun went down perfectly clear , and rose so the next morning ; and having little or no wind , and a smooth sea , the sun shining upon it , the sight was , as i thought , the most delightful that ever i saw .",31
"the sixth day of our being at sea we came into yarmouth roads ; the wind having been contrary and the weather calm , we had made but little way since the storm . here we were obliged to come to an anchor , and here we lay , the wind continuing contrary — viz . at south - west — for seven or eight days , during which time a great many ships from newcastle came into the same roads , as the common harbour where the ships might wait for a wind for the river .",22

"harding wishing to calm him , approached him , but he hastily drew back .",3
"but my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that nothing could resist ; and though i had several times loud calls from my reason and my more composed judgment to go home , yet i had no power to do it . i know not what to call this , nor will i urge that it is a secret overruling decree , that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own destruction , even though it be before us , and that we rush upon it with our eyes open . certainly , nothing but some such decreed unavoidable misery , which it was impossible for me to escape , could have pushed me forward against the calm reasonings and persuasions of my most retired thoughts , and against two such visible instructions as i had met with in my first attempt .",122
a fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to thornfield hall .,4
"it happened one time , that going a - fishing in a calm morning , a fog rose so thick that , though we were not half a league from the shore , we lost sight of it ; and rowing we knew not whither or which way , we laboured all day , and all the next night ; and when the morning came we found we had pulled off to sea instead of pulling in for the shore ; and that we were at least two leagues from the shore . however , we got well in again , though with a great deal of labour and some danger ; for the wind began to blow pretty fresh in the morning ; but we were all very hungry .",12
"when the transports of the two lovers were calmer , milady , who had not the same motives for forgetfulness that d’artagnan had , was the first to return to reality , and asked the young man if the means which were on the morrow to bring on the encounter between him and de wardes were already arranged in his mind .",8

"there was a full complement of passengers on board , among them english , many americans , a large number of coolies on their way to california , and several east indian officers , who were spending their vacation in making the tour of the world . nothing of moment happened on the voyage ; the steamer , sustained on its large paddles , rolled but little , and the pacific almost justified its name . mr . fogg was as calm and taciturn as ever . his young companion felt herself more and more attached to him by other ties than gratitude ; his silent but generous nature impressed her more than she thought ; and it was almost unconsciously that she yielded to emotions which did not seem to have the least effect upon her protector . aouda took the keenest interest in his plans , and became impatient at any incident which seemed likely to retard his journey .",81
"i had three encouragements—1st , a smooth , calm sea ; 2ndly , the tide rising , and setting in to the shore ; 3rdly , what little wind there was blew me towards the land . and thus , having found two or three broken oars belonging to the boat — and , besides the tools which were in the chest , i found two saws , an axe , and a hammer ; with this cargo i put to sea . for a mile or thereabouts my raft went very well , only that i found it drive a little distant from the place where i had landed before ; by which i perceived that there was some indraft of the water , and consequently i hoped to find some creek or river there , which i might make use of as a port to get to land with my cargo .",8
"i had been now thirteen days on shore , and had been eleven times on board the ship , in which time i had brought away all that one pair of hands could well be supposed capable to bring ; though i believe verily , had the calm weather held , i should have brought away the whole ship , piece by piece . but preparing the twelfth time to go on board , i found the wind began to rise : however , at low water i went on board , and though i thought i had rummaged the cabin so effectually that nothing more could be found , yet i discovered a locker with drawers in it , in one of which i found two or three razors , and one pair of large scissors , with some ten or a dozen of good knives and forks : in another i found about thirty - six pounds value in money — some european coin , some brazil , some pieces of eight , some gold , and some silver .",47
"and dangerous he looked : his black eyes darted sparks . calming himself by an effort , he added--",11
"yes , indeed , those are the marks of teeth imprinted upon the metal ! the jaws which they arm must be possessed of amazing strength . is there some monster beneath us belonging to the extinct races , more voracious than the shark , more fearful in vastness than the whale ? i could not take my eyes off this indented iron bar . surely will my last night 's dream be realised ? these thoughts agitated me all day , and my imagination scarcely calmed down after several hours ' sleep .",86
""" you have sent for me , sir , "" said athos to m. de treville , in a feeble yet perfectly calm voice , "" you have sent for me , as my comrades inform me , and i have hastened to receive your orders . i am here ; what do you want with me ? """,22

"but cyrus harding , after some moments ' thought , replied in the calm tone which was usual to him,--",13

"with these words , jefferson hope leaned back in his chair and began the following remarkable statement . he spoke in a calm and methodical manner , as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough . i can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account , for i have had access to lestrade 's note - book , in which the prisoner 's words were taken down exactly as they were uttered .",22

""" me , i 'm out like a light ! "" ned land replied . my two companions lay down on the cabin 's carpeting and were soon deep in slumber . as for me , i gave in less readily to this intense need for sleep . too many thoughts had piled up in my mind , too many insoluble questions had arisen , too many images were keeping my eyelids open ! where were we ? what strange power was carrying us along ? i felt -- or at least i thought i did -- the submersible sinking toward the sea 's lower strata . intense nightmares besieged me . in these mysterious marine sanctuaries , i envisioned hosts of unknown animals , and this underwater boat seemed to be a blood relation of theirs : living , breathing , just as fearsome . . . ! then my mind grew calmer , my imagination melted into hazy drowsiness , and i soon fell into an uneasy slumber .",153

"but even so , was the man going to let us die of starvation , locked up in this cramped prison , exposed to those horrible temptations to which people are driven by extreme hunger ? this grim possibility took on a dreadful intensity in my mind , and fired by my imagination , i felt an unreasoning terror run through me . conseil stayed calm . ned land bellowed .",65
