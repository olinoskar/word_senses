"it was just at high - water when these people came on shore ; and while they rambled about to see what kind of a place they were in , they had carelessly stayed till the tide was spent , and the water was ebbed considerably away , leaving their boat aground . they had left two men in the boat , who , as i found afterwards , having drunk a little too much brandy , fell asleep ; however , one of them waking a little sooner than the other and finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it , hallooed out for the rest , who were straggling about : upon which they all soon came to the boat : but it was past all their strength to launch her , the boat being very heavy , and the shore on that side being a soft oozy sand , almost like a quicksand . in this condition , like true seamen , who are , perhaps , the least of all mankind given to forethought , they gave it over , and away they strolled about the country again ; and i heard one of them say aloud to another , calling them off from the boat , “ why , let her alone , jack , ca n’t you ? she ’ll float next tide ; ” by which i was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of what countrymen they were .",22

"here a question popped into my head . how did the commander of this aquatic residence go about it ? did he obtain air using chemical methods , releasing the oxygen contained in potassium chlorate by heating it , meanwhile absorbing the carbon dioxide with potassium hydroxide ? if so , he would have to keep up some kind of relationship with the shore , to come by the materials needed for such an operation . did he simply limit himself to storing the air in high - pressure tanks and then dispense it according to his crew 's needs ? perhaps . or , proceeding in a more convenient , more economical , and consequently more probable fashion , was he satisfied with merely returning to breathe at the surface of the water like a cetacean , renewing his oxygen supply every twenty - four hours ? in any event , whatever his method was , it seemed prudent to me that he use this method without delay .",58

"we did so , and it was well we did ; for never was a more furious charge than the creatures made upon us in this place . they came on with a growling kind of noise , and mounted the piece of timber , which , as i said , was our breastwork , as if they were only rushing upon their prey ; and this fury of theirs , it seems , was principally occasioned by their seeing our horses behind us . i ordered our men to fire as before , every other man ; and they took their aim so sure that they killed several of the wolves at the first volley ; but there was a necessity to keep a continual firing , for they came on like devils , those behind pushing on those before .",34
"the fact is that our friend , the baronet , begins to display a considerable interest in our fair neighbour . it is not to be wondered at , for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an active man like him , and she is a very fascinating and beautiful woman . there is something tropical and exotic about her which forms a singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother . yet he also gives the idea of hidden fires . he has certainly a very marked influence over her , for i have seen her continually glance at him as she talked as if seeking approbation for what she said . i trust that he is kind to her . there is a dry glitter in his eyes , and a firm set of his thin lips , which goes with a positive and possibly a harsh nature . you would find him an interesting study .",120

"from the corner of the divan of persian saddle - bags on which he was lying , smoking , as was his custom , innumerable cigarettes , lord henry wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey - sweet and honey- coloured blossoms of a laburnum , whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs ; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore - silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window , producing a kind of momentary japanese effect , and making him think of those pallid , jade - faced painters of tokio who , through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile , seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion .",97
