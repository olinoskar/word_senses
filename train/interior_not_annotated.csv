"7 the interior of "" the musketeers """,2
"this was the cart entering the circle of light , and cyrus harding could hear the noise made by the door , as his companions shut it and fastened the interior bars .",30
"some think that it will arise from the falling of the temperature , which the sun will experience after millions of years ; others , from the gradual extinction of the fires in the interior of our globe , which have a greater influence on it than is generally supposed .",34
"if , then , the moon has become cold , it is because the interior fires to which , as do all the stars of the stellar world , it owes its origin , are completely extinct .",14
"in its interior i heard the sound of footsteps and muffled voices . but captain nemo did n't appear . just as i was about to leave the lounge , ned land and conseil entered .",2
"the deck , the upperworks , the interior woodwork and the rigging might be finished afterwards , but the essential point was that the colonists should have an assured refuge away from the island .",7
"now this project was to minutely explore the interior well , the mouth of which was on a level with the passage of granite house , and which communicated with the sea , since it formerly supplied a way to the waters of the lake .",8
my uncle now took the opportunity to explain to hans that it was his intention to explore the interior of the volcano to its farthest limits .,18
"the aperture , which was almost round , was about five feet in diameter ; the dark passage was cut out in the live rock and lined with a coat of the eruptive matter which formerly issued from it ; the interior was level with the ground outside , so that we were able to enter without difficulty . we were following a horizontal plane , when , only six paces in , our progress was interrupted by an enormous block just across our way .",41
"by means of the diving dress he could easily reach the well in the interior of granite house , and climbing by the projections of rock to its upper orifice he heard the colonists as they recounted the past , and studied the present and future .",14
"the frigate 's interior accommodations complemented its nautical virtues . i was well satisfied with my cabin , which was located in the stern and opened into the officers ' mess .",3
suddenly a noise from the ship 's interior became audible . voices were answering each other hurriedly . what was it ? had they spotted our escape ? i felt ned land sliding a dagger into my hand .,7
"this outlet had now become practicable , since the water no longer rushed through it , and it would doubtless be easy to explore the interior .",25
"placed where he was , d’artagnan could not perceive the face of aramis . we say aramis , because the young man entertained no doubt that it was his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of the exterior . curiosity prevailed over prudence ; and profiting by the preoccupation into which the sight of the handkerchief appeared to have plunged the two personages now on the scene , he stole from his hiding place , and quick as lightning , but stepping with utmost caution , he ran and placed himself close to the angle of the wall , from which his eye could pierce the interior of aramis ’s room .",111
"they did not speak , but they thought ; and the thought came to more than one , that some polypus or other gigantic cephalopod might inhabit the interior cavities , which were in communication with the sea .",28
""" very well . have the interior seats , bunks , and frames pulled down , and burn them . """,6
"before more carefully examining the interior features of this enormous cavern , and before deciding if it was the work of nature or humankind , i went over to captain nemo .",5
"the colonists , not having any pressing work out of doors , profited by the bad weather to work at the interior of granite house , the arrangement of which was becoming more complete from day to day .",21
"twenty minutes later we boarded ship . the hatches were open . after mooring the skiff , we reentered the nautilus 's interior .",22
""" this is my decision , "" replied professor liedenbrock , putting on one of his grandest airs . "" neither you nor anybody else knows with any certainty what is going on in the interior of this globe , since not the twelve thousandth part of its radius is known ; science is eminently perfectible ; and every new theory is soon routed by a newer . was it not always believed until fourier that the temperature of the interplanetary spaces decreased perpetually ? and is it not known at the present time that the greatest cold of the ethereal regions is never lower than 40 degrees below zero fahr . ? why should it not be the same with the internal heat ? why should it not , at a certain depth , attain an impassable limit , instead of rising to such a point as to fuse the most infusible metals ? """,35
"for this , it was enough to augment the flow of the little stream which supplied the interior of granite house with water .",17
was there any connection between the commotion of the atmosphere and that of the interior of the earth ?,14
"but at any rate , if we have no enemies in the interior , they may come from the exterior , for parts of the pacific are very dangerous .",12
"unhappily for his master , as well as himself , his curiosity drew him unconsciously farther off than he intended to go . at last , having seen the parsee carnival wind away in the distance , he was turning his steps towards the station , when he happened to espy the splendid pagoda on malabar hill , and was seized with an irresistible desire to see its interior . he was quite ignorant that it is forbidden to christians to enter certain indian temples , and that even the faithful must not go in without first leaving their shoes outside the door . it may be said here that the wise policy of the british government severely punishes a disregard of the practices of the native religions .",68
would the interior acclivities of the crater be practicable ?,2
"little by little , herbert and he climbing up the sides of the interior , saw the crater widen above their heads .",13
"in fact , an earthquake -- a phenomenon which often accompanies volcanic eruption -- is enough to change the interior arrangement of a mountain , and to open new outlets for the burning lava .",19
"it had been used , apparently , in remote feudal times , for the worst purposes of a donjon - keep , and , in later days , as a place of deposit for powder , or some other highly combustible substance , as a portion of its floor , and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it , were carefully sheathed with copper .",53
"when these interior arrangements were finished , the engineer occupied himself in blocking up the outlet by the lake , so as to prevent any access by that way .",2
"on january 16 the nautilus seemed to have fallen asleep just a few meters beneath the surface of the water . its electric equipment had been turned off , and the motionless propeller let it ride with the waves . i assumed that the crew were busy with interior repairs , required by the engine 's strenuous mechanical action .",48
"during the lecture the train had been making good progress , and towards half - past twelve it reached the northwest border of the great salt lake . thence the passengers could observe the vast extent of this interior sea , which is also called the dead sea , and into which flows an american jordan . it is a picturesque expanse , framed in lofty crags in large strata , encrusted with white salt -- a superb sheet of water , which was formerly of larger extent than now , its shores having encroached with the lapse of time , and thus at once reduced its breadth and increased its depth .",38
"they set noiselessly to work , and the parsee on one side and passepartout on the other began to loosen the bricks so as to make an aperture two feet wide . they were getting on rapidly , when suddenly a cry was heard in the interior of the temple , followed almost instantly by other cries replying from the outside . passepartout and the guide stopped . had they been heard ? was the alarm being given ? common prudence urged them to retire , and they did so , followed by phileas fogg and sir francis . they again hid themselves in the wood , and waited till the disturbance , whatever it might be , ceased , holding themselves ready to resume their attempt without delay . but , awkwardly enough , the guards now appeared at the rear of the temple , and there installed themselves , in readiness to prevent a surprise .",46
""" that is probable , "" replied the engineer , "" although we have not yet explored the interior ; but if no human beings are found , i fear that dangerous animals may abound .",18
"after renewing its air , the nautilus stayed at an average depth of fifteen meters , enabling it to return quickly to the surface of the waves . and , contrary to custom , it executed such a maneuver several times during that day of january 19 . the chief officer would then climb onto the platform , and his usual phrase would ring through the ship 's interior .",68
"at that moment he thought of the trees , upon whose leaves the light still shone ; and as one of them drooped over the road , he thought that from its branches he might get a glimpse of the interior of the pavilion .",40
"nothing had changed in its interior arrangements . the prison was still a prison and its prisoners still prisoners . but , taking advantage of our slumber , the steward had cleared the table . consequently , nothing indicated any forthcoming improvement in our situation , and i seriously wondered if we were doomed to spend the rest of our lives in this cage .",5
"however -- and cyrus harding observed it in silent astonishment -- not only , as has been said , had the hull of the brig enormously suffered from the shock , whatever it was , that had occasioned the catastrophe , but the interior arrangements had been destroyed , especially towards the bows .",43
"d’artagnan drew back the bolt with precaution , and both , light as shadows , glided through the interior door into the passage , ascended the stairs as quietly as possible , and entered d’artagnan ’s chambers .",18
"taken below the frozen surface , and conducted through the passage , it preserved its fluidity , and arrived at an interior reservoir which had been hollowed out at the back part of the storeroom , while the overflow ran through the well to the sea .",21
"the sea had penetrated to the end of the passages , and everything was overthrown and destroyed in the interior of the chimneys !",19
