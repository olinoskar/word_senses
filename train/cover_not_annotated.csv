"a week later dorian gray was sitting in the conservatory at selby royal , talking to the pretty duchess of monmouth , who with her husband , a jaded - looking man of sixty , was amongst his guests . it was tea- time , and the mellow light of the huge , lace - covered lamp that stood on the table lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service at which the duchess was presiding . her white hands were moving daintily among the cups , and her full red lips were smiling at something that dorian had whispered to her . lord henry was lying back in a silk - draped wicker chair , looking at them . on a peach - coloured divan sat lady narborough , pretending to listen to the duke 's description of the last brazilian beetle that he had added to his collection . three young men in elaborate smoking - suits were handing tea - cakes to some of the women . the house - party consisted of twelve people , and there were more expected to arrive on the next day .",55
"the vast liquid plain , lashed without mercy by the storm , appeared as if covered with herds of furious chargers , whose white and disheveled crests were streaming in the wind .",15
"some of these wrecked ships had perished in collisions , others from hitting granite reefs . i saw a few that had sunk straight down , their masting still upright , their rigging stiffened by the water . they looked like they were at anchor by some immense , open , offshore mooring where they were waiting for their departure time . when the nautilus passed between them , covering them with sheets of electricity , they seemed ready to salute us with their colors and send us their serial numbers ! but no , nothing but silence and death filled this field of catastrophes !",69
"the one which had been seized in the hall of granite house was a great fellow , six feet high , with an admirably poportioned frame , a broad chest , head of a moderate size , the facial angle reaching sixty - five degrees , round skull , projecting nose , skin covered with soft glossy hair , in short , a fine specimen of the anthropoids .",53
"the engineer 's condition would , therefore , have been bad enough , if his companions had not carefully covered him with their coats and waistcoats .",19
"in the northeast there emerged two volcanic islands of unequal size , surrounded by a coral reef whose circuit measured forty miles . we were facing the island of vanikoro proper , to which captain dumont d'urville had given the name "" island of the search "" ; we lay right in front of the little harbor of vana , located in latitude 16 degrees 4 ' south and longitude 164 degrees 32 ' east . its shores seemed covered with greenery from its beaches to its summits inland , crowned by mt . kapogo , which is 476 fathoms high .",79
"arriving at the topmost ridge of this promontory , i could see vast white plains covered with walruses . these animals were playing among themselves . they were howling not in anger but in glee .",15
"d’artagnan glanced down at his boots , all covered with mud ; but that same glance fell upon the shoes and stockings of the mercer , and it might have been said they had been dipped in the same mud heap . both were stained with splashes of mud of the same appearance .",8
"the officer who had stopped in front of her and studied her with so much care might have been twenty - five or twenty - six years of age . he was of pale complexion , with clear blue eyes , rather deeply set ; his mouth , fine and well cut , remained motionless in its correct lines ; his chin , strongly marked , denoted that strength of will which in the ordinary britannic type denotes mostly nothing but obstinacy ; a brow a little receding , as is proper for poets , enthusiasts , and soldiers , was scarcely shaded by short thin hair which , like the beard which covered the lower part of his face , was of a beautiful deep chestnut color .",113
"what a sad and fearful sight , and how painful to the colonists , who , from a fertile domain covered with forests , irrigated by watercourses , and enriched by the produce of their toils , found themselves , as it were , transported to a desolate rock , upon which , but for their reserves of provisions , they could not even gather the means of subsistence !",20
"i have often thought of all these things , my friends , and i seriously believe that the aspect of our globe will some day be completely changed ; that by the raising of new continents the sea will cover the old , and that , in future ages , a columbus will go to discover the islands of chimborazo , of the himalayas , or of mont blanc , remains of a submerged america , asia , and europe .",39
"another blow full upon his forehead at the same moment brought him to the ground , covered with blood and almost fainting .",16
"i rushed to the window and saw crusts of coral : fungus coral , siphonula coral , alcyon coral , sea anemone from the genus caryophylia , plus myriads of charming fish including greenfish , damselfish , sweepers , snappers , and squirrelfish ; underneath this coral covering i detected some rubble the old dredges had n't been able to tear free-- iron stirrups , anchors , cannons , shells , tackle from a capstan , a stempost , all objects hailing from the wrecked ships and now carpeted in moving flowers .",47
"the name of liedenbrock was honourably mentioned in colleges and learned societies . humphry davy , [ 2 ] humboldt , captain sir john franklin , general sabine , never failed to call upon him on their way through hamburg . becquerel , ebelman , brewster , dumas , milne - edwards , saint - claire - deville frequently consulted him upon the most difficult problems in chemistry , a science which was indebted to him for considerable discoveries , for in 1853 there had appeared at leipzig an imposing folio by otto liedenbrock , entitled , "" a treatise upon transcendental chemistry , "" with plates ; a work , however , which failed to cover its expenses .",116
"then i began to lose my head . i arose with my arms stretched out before me , attempting painfully to feel my way . i began to run wildly , hurrying through the inextricable maze , still descending , still running through the substance of the earth 's thick crust , a struggling denizen of geological ' faults , ' crying , shouting , yelling , soon bruised by contact with the jagged rock , falling and rising again bleeding , trying to drink the blood which covered my face , and even waiting for some rock to shatter my skull against .",88
"on this ground he placed a layer of branches and chopped wood , on which were piled some pieces of shistose pyrites , buttressed one against the other , the whole being covered with a thin layer of pyrites , previously reduced to the size of a nut .",32
"then new layers of bruised pyrites were arranged so as to form an immense heap , the exterior of which was covered with earth and grass , several air - holes being left , as if it was a stack of wood which was to be carbonized to make charcoal .",21
"an enormous mass was sinking beneath the waters , and the nautilus , missing none of its death throes , was descending into the depths with it . ten meters away , i could see its gaping hull , into which water was rushing with a sound of thunder , then its double rows of cannons and railings . its deck was covered with dark , quivering shadows .",62
"the juncture was favorable . the english , who require , above everything , good living in order to be good soldiers , only eating salt meat and bad biscuit , had many invalids in their camp . still further , the sea , very rough at this period of the year all along the sea coast , destroyed every day some little vessel ; and the shore , from the point of l’aiguillon to the trenches , was at every tide literally covered with the wrecks of pinnacles , roberges , and feluccas . the result was that even if the king ’s troops remained quietly in their camp , it was evident that some day or other , buckingham , who only continued in the isle from obstinacy , would be obliged to raise the siege .",83
"i would not give up this paper if covered with as many gold pieces . """,8
"it was a library . tall , black - rosewood bookcases , inlaid with copperwork , held on their wide shelves a large number of uniformly bound books . these furnishings followed the contours of the room , their lower parts leading to huge couches upholstered in maroon leather and curved for maximum comfort . light , movable reading stands , which could be pushed away or pulled near as desired , allowed books to be positioned on them for easy study . in the center stood a huge table covered with pamphlets , among which some newspapers , long out of date , were visible . electric light flooded this whole harmonious totality , falling from four frosted half globes set in the scrollwork of the ceiling . i stared in genuine wonderment at this room so ingeniously laid out , and i could n't believe my eyes .",90
"then cyrus harding , having ended his survey , re - ascended , drew up the ladder , covered the mouth of the well , and returned thoughtfully to the diningroom , saying to himself,-- "" i have seen nothing , and yet there is something there ! """,18
"the exploration was therefore continued for another two miles in the midst of country covered with eucalypti , which predominated in the woods of this portion of the island .",14
""" hallo ! the islet is covered with snow ! """,6
"mr . rochester , as he sat in his damask - covered chair , looked different to what i had seen him look before ; not quite so stern -- much less gloomy .",11
"their companions were soon beside them , but could only ascertain one thing , that not only the islet but all the beach below granite house was covered with one uniform sheet of white .",27
""" jane , your little feet are bare ; lie down and cover yourself with my quilt . """,12
"in fact , three or four of these unfortunate men , covered with dirt and blood , fled along the hollow way , and at length regained the city . these were all who were left of the little troop .",11
"glades , bristling with stumps worn away by time , were covered with dry wood , which formed an inexhaustible store of fuel .",11
"the poor fowl was thin , and covered with one of those thick , bristly skins through which the teeth can not penetrate with all their efforts . the fowl must have been sought for a long time on the perch , to which it had retired to die of old age .",7
"when i came to myself , i was stretched in half darkness , covered with thick coats and blankets . my uncle was watching over me , to discover the least sign of life . at my first sigh he took my hand ; when i opened my eyes he uttered a cry of joy .",13
"the frigate then went along the new jersey coast -- the wonderful right bank of this river , all loaded down with country homes-- and passed by the forts to salutes from their biggest cannons . the abraham lincoln replied by three times lowering and hoisting the american flag , whose thirty - nine stars gleamed from the gaff of the mizzen sail ; then , changing speed to take the buoy - marked channel that curved into the inner bay formed by the spit of sandy hook , it hugged this sand - covered strip of land where thousands of spectators acclaimed us one more time .",94
"with these words mr . brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn in a cover , and having rung for his carriage , he departed .",16
"and besides , my dear old basil , if you really want to console me , teach me rather to forget what has happened , or to see it from a proper artistic point of view . was it not gautier who used to write about la consolation des arts ? i remember picking up a little vellum - covered book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase . well , i am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at marlow together , the young man who used to say that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life . i love beautiful things that one can touch and handle . old brocades , green bronzes , lacquer - work , carved ivories , exquisite surroundings , luxury , pomp -- there is much to be got from all these . but the artistic temperament that they create , or at any rate reveal , is still more to me .",59
"i sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain : it was a chilly night ; i covered my shoulders with a shawl , and then i proceeded _ to think _ again with all my might .",20
"the hill , covered with trees disposed in terraces , intercepted the view .",3
"equipped with a magnifying glass , he lit a fire of deadwood that was soon crackling merrily . meanwhile conseil and i selected the finest artocarpus fruit . some still were n't ripe enough , and their thick skins covered white , slightly fibrous pulps . but a great many others were yellowish and gelatinous , just begging to be picked .",39
"like a covey of snipe over a marsh , there rose underfoot schools of unusual fish from the genus monopterus , whose members have no fin but their tail . i recognized the javanese eel , a genuine eight - decimeter serpent with a bluish gray belly , which , without the gold lines over its flanks , could easily be confused with the conger eel . from the butterfish genus , whose oval bodies are very flat , i observed several adorned in brilliant colors and sporting a dorsal fin like a sickle , edible fish that , when dried and marinated , make an excellent dish known by the name "" karawade "" ; then some sea poachers , fish belonging to the genus aspidophoroides , whose bodies are covered with scaly armor divided into eight lengthwise sections .",131
"these were the historical memories that captain nemo 's scrawl sent rushing through my mind . thus , led by the strangest of fates , i was treading underfoot one of the mountains of that continent ! my hands were touching ruins many thousands of years old , contemporary with prehistoric times ! i was walking in the very place where contemporaries of early man had walked ! my heavy soles were crushing the skeletons of animals from the age of fable , animals that used to take cover in the shade of these trees now turned to stone !",88
"as i mused in this way , trying to establish in my memory every detail of this impressive landscape , captain nemo was leaning his elbows on a moss - covered monument , motionless as if petrified in some mute trance . was he dreaming of those lost generations , asking them for the secret of human destiny ? was it here that this strange man came to revive himself , basking in historical memories , reliving that bygone life , he who had no desire for our modern one ? i would have given anything to know his thoughts , to share them , understand them !",30
"pencroft looked attentively at the plant , covered with long silky hair , the leaves being clothed with soft down .",7
"the face of this young woman was covered with a black velvet mask ; but notwithstanding this precaution , which was in fact taken rather against others than against him , he at once recognized his usual guide , the light and intelligent mme . bonacieux .",7
"at this place the beach was covered with little mounds , concealing perfectly spherical turtles ' eggs , with white hard shells , the albumen of which does not coagulate as that of birds ' eggs .",6
"poor jup still held in his hand the stump of his broken cudgel , but deprived of his weapon he had been overpowered by numbers , and his chest was covered with severe wounds .",30
"at this moment a flock of birds , of a small size and pretty plumage , with long glancing tails , dispersed themselves among the branches strewing their feathers , which covered the ground as with fine down .",31
"i then understood captain nemo 's intent . by leaving the pearl buried beneath the giant clam 's mantle , he allowed it to grow imperceptibly . with each passing year the mollusk 's secretions added new concentric layers . the captain alone was familiar with the cave where this wonderful fruit of nature was "" ripening "" ; he alone reared it , so to speak , in order to transfer it one day to his dearly beloved museum . perhaps , following the examples of oyster farmers in china and india , he had even predetermined the creation of this pearl by sticking under the mollusk 's folds some piece of glass or metal that was gradually covered with mother - of - pearl . in any case , comparing this pearl to others i already knew about , and to those shimmering in the captain 's collection , i estimated that it was worth at least 10,000,000 francs . it was a superb natural curiosity rather than a luxurious piece of jewelry , because i do n't know of any female ear that could handle it .",119
"the sailor and the lad , creeping among the grass , arrived at the foot of a tree , whose lower branches were covered with little birds .",23
"on looking around him , however , as he could perceive no threatening object , as nothing indicated that he ran any real danger , as the bench was comfortably covered with a well - stuffed cushion , as the wall was ornamented with a beautiful cordova leather , and as large red damask curtains , fastened back by gold clasps , floated before the window , he perceived by degrees that his fear was exaggerated , and he began to turn his head to the right and the left , upward and downward .",30
"it was a stormy and dark night ; vast clouds covered the heavens , concealing the stars ; the moon would not rise till midnight .",10
"a square table , covered with books and papers , upon which was unrolled an immense plan of the city of la rochelle , occupied the center of the room .",4
""" well , sir , you 'll be covered with cobwebs if you go into it . why , it has n't been opened for nearly five years -- not since his lordship died . """,8
"this man , except a sword , had all the appearance of a soldier ; and his buff boots still slightly covered with dust , indicated that he had been on horseback in the course of the day .",21
""" i mean to say that when i came in , although i had the key of your apartment in my pocket , and that key had never quit me , i found a letter on the green table cover in your bedroom . """,39
"a sandy beach unfolded before us , measuring 500 feet at its widest point between the waters of the lake and the foot of the mountain 's walls . via this strand you could easily circle the lake . but the base of these high walls consisted of broken soil over which there lay picturesque piles of volcanic blocks and enormous pumice stones . all these crumbling masses were covered with an enamel polished by the action of underground fires , and they glistened under the stream of electric light from our beacon . stirred up by our footsteps , the mica - rich dust on this beach flew into the air like a cloud of sparks .",69
""" this , "" replied dorian , moving the screen back . "" can you move it , covering and all , just as it is ? i do n't want it to get scratched going upstairs . """,18
"when he had once passed the massive door covered with long square - headed nails , he fell into the midst of a troop of swordsmen , who crossed one another in their passage , calling out , quarreling , and playing tricks one with another .",8
"but the plateau of prospect heights was open to them , and not covered by the fire of granite house .",13
"at an elevation of about thirty meters , the nature of the terrain changed without becoming any easier . pudding stones and trachyte gave way to black basaltic rock : here , lying in slabs all swollen with blisters ; there , shaped like actual prisms and arranged into a series of columns that supported the springings of this immense vault , a wonderful sample of natural architecture . then , among this basaltic rock , there snaked long , hardened lava flows inlaid with veins of bituminous coal and in places covered by wide carpets of sulfur . the sunshine coming through the crater had grown stronger , shedding a hazy light over all the volcanic waste forever buried in the heart of this extinct mountain .",92
"by then the frigate lay in latitude 31 degrees 15 ' north and longitude 136 degrees 42 ' east . the shores of japan were less than 200 miles to our leeward . night was coming on . eight o'clock had just struck . huge clouds covered the moon 's disk , then in its first quarter . the sea undulated placidly beneath the frigate 's stempost .",46
"for calking the seams they made oakum of dry seaweed , which was hammered in between the planks ; then these seams were covered with boiling tar , which was obtained in great abundance from the pines in the forest .",23

"this bird belonged to the finest of the eight species credited to papua and its neighboring islands . it was a "" great emerald , "" one of the rarest birds of paradise . it measured three decimeters long . its head was comparatively small , and its eyes , placed near the opening of its beak , were also small . but it offered a wonderful mixture of hues : a yellow beak , brown feet and claws , hazel wings with purple tips , pale yellow head and scruff of the neck , emerald throat , the belly and chest maroon to brown . two strands , made of a horn substance covered with down , rose over its tail , which was lengthened by long , very light feathers of wonderful fineness , and they completed the costume of this marvelous bird that the islanders have poetically named "" the sun bird .

"after the heat of these warm summer days , in the evening when their work was finished and the sea - breeze began to blow , they liked to sit on the edge of prospect heights , in a sort of veranda , covered with creepers , which neb had made with his own hands .",43
"i approached my cheek to her lips : she would not touch it . she said i oppressed her by leaning over the bed , and again demanded water . as i laid her down -- for i raised her and supported her on my arm while she drank -- i covered her ice - cold and clammy hand with mine : the feeble fingers shrank from my touch -- the glazing eyes shunned my gaze .",51
"then she cried , "" ahem ! "" under cover of the mea culpa , striking her breast so vigorously that everybody , even the lady with the red cushion , turned round toward her . porthos paid no attention . nevertheless , he understood it all , but was deaf .",9
"the platform emerged only eighty centimeters above the waves . the nautilus 's bow and stern boasted that spindle - shaped outline that had caused the ship to be compared appropriately to a long cigar . i noted the slight overlap of its sheet - iron plates , which resembled the scales covering the bodies of our big land reptiles . so i had a perfectly natural explanation for why , despite the best spyglasses , this boat had always been mistaken for a marine animal .",52
"during those nineteen days just mentioned , no unique incidents distinguished our voyage . i saw little of the captain . he was at work . in the library i often found books he had left open , especially books on natural history . he had thumbed through my work on the great ocean depths , and the margins were covered with his notes , which sometimes contradicted my theories and formulations . but the captain remained content with this method of refining my work , and he rarely discussed it with me . sometimes i heard melancholy sounds reverberating from the organ , which he played very expressively , but only at night in the midst of the most secretive darkness , while the nautilus slumbered in the wilderness of the ocean .",60
"the colonists , therefore , were careful to observe the sea around the island , and every day their telescope covered the horizon enclosed by union and washington bays .",20
""" nor that either , "" he answered . "" this is no northern mountain ; here are no granite peaks capped with snow . look , axel , look !

"the tempest ended about the 9th of march , but the sky remained covered with clouds during the whole of this last summer month .",13
in addition to this he perceived that the top of a wardrobe and the marble of a commode were covered with empty bottles .,19
"after half an hour 's walking , on the other side of the promontory which formed the little natural harbour , i perceived hans at work . in a few more steps i was at his side . to my great surprise a half - finished raft was already lying on the sand , made of a peculiar kind of wood , and a great number of planks , straight and bent , and of frames , were covering the ground , enough almost for a little fleet .",78
"beyond portsmouth the sea was covered with vessels whose masts , like a forest of poplars despoiled by the winter , bent with each breath of the wind .",5
"hallward glanced round him with a puzzled expression . the room looked as if it had not been lived in for years . a faded flemish tapestry , a curtained picture , an old italian cassone , and an almost empty book - case -- that was all that it seemed to contain , besides a chair and a table . as dorian gray was lighting a half - burned candle that was standing on the mantelshelf , he saw that the whole place was covered with dust and that the carpet was in holes . a mouse ran scuffling behind the wainscoting . there was a damp odour of mildew .",85
"felton arrived at the palace of the admiralty , covered with dust , and streaming with perspiration .",9

"the garden was a wide inclosure , surrounded with walls so high as to exclude every glimpse of prospect ; a covered verandah ran down one side , and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little beds : these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate , and each bed had an owner .",21

"there once more , through the panels opening into these caribbean waters ten meters below the surface of the waves , i found so many fascinating exhibits to describe in my daily notes ! among other zoophytes there were portuguese men - of - war known by the name physalia pelagica , like big , oblong bladders with a pearly sheen , spreading their membranes to the wind , letting their blue tentacles drift like silken threads ; to the eye delightful jellyfish , to the touch actual nettles that ooze a corrosive liquid . among the articulates there were annelid worms one and a half meters long , furnished with a pink proboscis , equipped with 1,700 organs of locomotion , snaking through the waters , and as they went , throwing off every gleam in the solar spectrum . from the fish branch there were manta rays , enormous cartilaginous fish ten feet long and weighing 600 pounds , their pectoral fin triangular , their midback slightly arched , their eyes attached to the edges of the face at the front of the head ; they floated like wreckage from a ship , sometimes fastening onto our windows like opaque shutters . there were american triggerfish for which nature has ground only black and white pigments , feather - shaped gobies that were long and plump with yellow fins and jutting jaws , sixteen - decimeter mackerel with short , sharp teeth , covered with small scales , and related to the albacore species . next came swarms of red mullet corseted in gold stripes from head to tail , their shining fins all aquiver , genuine masterpieces of jewelry , formerly sacred to the goddess diana , much in demand by rich romans , and about which the old saying goes : "" he who catches them does n't eat them ! "" finally , adorned with emerald ribbons and dressed in velvet and silk , golden angelfish passed before our eyes like courtiers in the paintings of veronese ; spurred gilthead stole by with their swift thoracic fins ; thread herring fifteen inches long were wrapped in their phosphorescent glimmers ; gray mullet thrashed the sea with their big fleshy tails ; red salmon seemed to mow the waves with their slicing pectorals ; and silver moonfish , worthy of their name , rose on the horizon of the waters like the whitish reflections of many moons .",245

"the canadian was not mistaken . cavorting around the nautilus was a school of triggerfish with flat bodies , grainy skins , armed with stings on their dorsal fins , and with four prickly rows of quills quivering on both sides of their tails . nothing could have been more wonderful than the skin covering them : white underneath , gray above , with spots of gold sparkling in the dark eddies of the waves . around them , rays were undulating like sheets flapping in the wind , and among these i spotted , much to my glee , a chinese ray , yellowish on its topside , a dainty pink on its belly , and armed with three stings behind its eyes ; a rare species whose very existence was still doubted in lacépède 's day , since that pioneering classifier of fish had seen one only in a portfolio of japanese drawings .",54
"the two castaways , john ferrier and the little girl who had shared his fortunes and had been adopted as his daughter , accompanied the mormons to the end of their great pilgrimage . little lucy ferrier was borne along pleasantly enough in elder stangerson 's waggon , a retreat which she shared with the mormon 's three wives and with his son , a headstrong forward boy of twelve . having rallied , with the elasticity of childhood , from the shock caused by her mother 's death , she soon became a pet with the women , and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving canvas - covered home . in the meantime ferrier having recovered from his privations , distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable hunter . so rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions , that when they reached the end of their wanderings , it was unanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers , with the exception of young himself , and of stangerson , kemball , johnston , and drebber , who were the four principal elders .",111

"these cries had something so heartrending in them that m. d’artagnan , who had been at first the most eager in pursuit of milady , sat down on the stump of a tree and hung his head , covering his ears with the palms of his hands ; and yet , notwithstanding , he could still hear her cry and threaten .",38
"in the deep shade , at the farther end of the room , a figure ran backwards and forwards . what it was , whether beast or human being , one could not , at first sight , tell : it grovelled , seemingly , on all fours ; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal : but it was covered with clothing , and a quantity of dark , grizzled hair , wild as a mane , hid its head and face .",62
"a group of old fakirs were capering and making a wild ado round the statue ; these were striped with ochre , and covered with cuts whence their blood issued drop by drop -- stupid fanatics , who , in the great indian ceremonies , still throw themselves under the wheels of juggernaut . some brahmins , clad in all the sumptuousness of oriental apparel , and leading a woman who faltered at every step , followed . this woman was young , and as fair as a european . her head and neck , shoulders , ears , arms , hands , and toes were loaded down with jewels and gems with bracelets , earrings , and rings ; while a tunic bordered with gold , and covered with a light muslin robe , betrayed the outline of her form .",23

"the fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface from our minds the grim and gray impression which had been left upon both of us by our first experience of baskerville hall . as sir henry and i sat at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through the high mullioned windows , throwing watery patches of colour from the coats of arms which covered them . the dark panelling glowed like bronze in the golden rays , and it was hard to realize that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such a gloom into our souls upon the evening before .",64
"however , herbert , who had gone forward a little more to the left , soon came upon rocks covered with sea - weed , which , some hours later , would be hidden by the high tide .",19
"still more , he has lifted the corner of her mask -- that shield with which she covered herself and which rendered her so strong .",17
"the plesiosaurus , a serpent with a cylindrical body and a short tail , has four flappers or paddles to act like oars . its body is entirely covered with a thick armour of scales , and its neck , as flexible as a swan 's , rises thirty feet above the waves .",28
"trees , meadows , all disappeared beneath a covering several inches in depth .",8
"and the pocket - book was again deliberately produced , opened , sought through ; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of paper , hastily torn off : i recognised in its texture and its stains of ultra - marine , and lake , and vermillion , the ravished margin of the portrait - cover .",58
"herbert and gideon spilett killed two kangaroos with bows and arrows , and also an animal which strongly resembled both a hedgehog and an ant - eater . it was like the first because it rolled itself into a ball , and bristled with spines , and the second because it had sharp claws , a long slender snout which terminated in a bird 's beak , and an extendible tongue , covered with little thorns which served to hold the insects .",72
"but this hard substance could have been a bony carapace , like those that covered some prehistoric animals , and i might have left it at that and classified this monster among such amphibious reptiles as turtles or alligators .",14
""" yes , sir . our propeller is jammed . i think the horn - covered mandibles of one of these squid are entangled in the blades . that 's why we are n't moving . """,15
"the sea was covered with mutilated corpses . a fearsome explosion could n't have slashed , torn , or shredded these fleshy masses with greater violence . we were floating in the midst of gigantic bodies , bluish on the back , whitish on the belly , and all deformed by enormous protuberances . a few frightened sperm whales were fleeing toward the horizon . the waves were dyed red over an area of several miles , and the nautilus was floating in the middle of a sea of blood .",3
"my companions and i then witnessed an unusual sight . the panels in the lounge were open , and since the nautilus 's beacon was off , a hazy darkness reigned in the midst of the waters . covered with heavy clouds , the stormy sky gave only the faintest light to the ocean 's upper strata .",38
""" yes , indeed . i have no doubt that my friend 's explanation will cover the facts . i will take an unpleasant remembrance back to london with me to - morrow . """,15
"aramis , in a black gown , his head enveloped in a sort of round flat cap , not much unlike a calotte , was seated before an oblong table , covered with rolls of paper and enormous volumes in folio . at his right hand was placed the superior of the jesuits , and on his left the curate of montdidier .",31

"the night was dark . the moon , on the wane , scarcely left the horizon , and was covered with heavy clouds ; the height of the trees deepened the darkness .",19
"louis xiii appeared , walking fast . he was in hunting costume covered with dust , wearing large boots , and holding a whip in his hand .",12
in the twilight it was just possible to see that it was built of planks and covered with a thick tarpaulin .,16
"anyone consulting conseil would soon learn from the gallant lad that the branch mollusca is divided into five classes ; that the first class features the cephalopoda ( whose members are sometimes naked , sometimes covered with a shell ) , which consists of two families , the dibranchiata and the tetrabranchiata , which are distinguished by their number of gills ; that the family dibranchiata includes three genera , the argonaut , the squid , and the cuttlefish , and that the family tetrabranchiata contains only one genus , the nautilus . after this catalog , if some recalcitrant listener confuses the argonaut , which is acetabuliferous ( in other words , a bearer of suction tubes ) , with the nautilus , which is tentaculiferous ( a bearer of tentacles ) , it will be simply unforgivable .",35
"passepartout was dispatched in search of the steward , and soon returned with two packs of cards , some pins , counters , and a shelf covered with cloth . the game commenced . aouda understood whist sufficiently well , and even received some compliments on her playing from mr . fogg . as for the detective , he was simply an adept , and worthy of being matched against his present opponent .",26
"they were then careful to cover their eyes and mouths with handkerchiefs , for they ran the risk of being blinded and suffocated .",5
"on entering he found a man of short stature and intelligent eyes , but covered with rags .",14
"violent squalls assaulted us during the daytime . thanks to certain heavy mists , we could n't see from one end of the platform to the other . the wind shifted abruptly to every point on the compass . the snow was piling up in such packed layers , it had to be chipped loose with blows from picks . even in a temperature of merely -5 degrees centigrade , every outside part of the nautilus was covered with ice . a ship 's rigging would have been unusable , because all its tackle would have jammed in the grooves of the pulleys . only a craft without sails , driven by an electric motor that needed no coal , could face such high latitudes .",77
"this current swept along with it a whole host of moving creatures . argonauts , so common in the mediterranean , voyaged here in schools of large numbers . among cartilaginous fish , the most remarkable were rays whose ultra slender tails made up nearly a third of the body , which was shaped like a huge diamond twenty - five feet long ; then little one - meter sharks , the head large , the snout short and rounded , the teeth sharp and arranged in several rows , the body seemingly covered with scales .",93
"in open day the descent was less perilous , and , besides , the bed of ashes which covered the polished surface of the rock enabled them to make their footing more secure .",18
"my uncle left in haste his floating prison , or rather hospital . but before quitting the deck of the schooner he dragged me forward , and pointing with outstretched finger north of the bay at a distant mountain terminating in a double peak , a pair of cones covered with perpetual snow , he cried :",49
""" concealing the mad - woman 's neighbourhood from you , however , was something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a upas - tree : that demon 's vicinage is poisoned , and always was .",16
"there was a general disappointment among the passengers , who , without reckoning the delay , saw themselves compelled to trudge fifteen miles over a plain covered with snow . they grumbled and protested , and would certainly have thus attracted phileas fogg 's attention if he had not been completely absorbed in his game .",26
"the whole steep slope was covered with gray circular rings of stone , a score of them at least .",5
""" excuse the admiration of a connoisseur , "" said he as he waved his hand towards the line of portraits which covered the opposite wall . "" watson wo n't allow that i know anything of art , but that is mere jealousy , because our views upon the subject differ . now , these are a really very fine series of portraits . """,22
"arrived at the summit of the mound , pencroft and his two companions set to work , with no other tools than their hands , to despoil of its principal branches a rather sickly tree , a sort of marine fir ; with these branches they made a litter , on which , covered with grass and leaves , they could carry the engineer .",53

"the two found themselves in a small chapel covered with a tapestry of persian silk worked with gold , and brilliantly lighted with a vast number of candles .",8
"they proceeded but slowly , frequently looking back ; but , in consequence of the inclination of the soil , the lava gained rapidly in the east , and as its lower waves became solidified others , at boiling heat , covered them immediately .",41
"some old trunks , bent with age , showed black against the verdant grass which covered the ground .",15
"it was made of oak wood , very carefully closed and covered with a thick hide , which was secured by copper nails .",11
"we turned on our ruhmkorff devices and went along a coral shoal in the process of forming , which , given time , will someday close off this whole part of the indian ocean . our path was bordered by hopelessly tangled bushes , formed from snarls of shrubs all covered with little star - shaped , white - streaked flowers . only , contrary to plants on shore , these tree forms become attached to rocks on the seafloor by heading from top to bottom .",50
"as i said , the nautilus veered to the east . to be more accurate , i should have said to the northeast . sometimes on the surface of the waves , sometimes beneath them , the ship wandered for days amid these mists so feared by navigators . these are caused chiefly by melting ice , which keeps the air extremely damp . how many ships have perished in these waterways as they tried to get directions from the hazy lights on the coast ! how many casualties have been caused by these opaque mists ! how many collisions have occurred with these reefs , where the breaking surf is covered by the noise of the wind ! how many vessels have rammed each other , despite their running lights , despite the warnings given by their bosun 's pipes and alarm bells !",111
"the nets were hauled on board . they were a breed of trawl resembling those used off the normandy coast , huge pouches held half open by a floating pole and a chain laced through the lower meshes . trailing in this way from these iron glove makers , the resulting receptacles scoured the ocean floor and collected every marine exhibit in their path . that day they gathered up some unusual specimens from these fish - filled waterways : anglerfish whose comical movements qualify them for the epithet "" clowns , "" black commerson anglers equipped with their antennas , undulating triggerfish encircled by little red bands , bloated puffers whose venom is extremely insidious , some olive - hued lampreys , snipefish covered with silver scales , cutlass fish whose electrocuting power equals that of the electric eel and the electric ray , scaly featherbacks with brown crosswise bands , greenish codfish , several varieties of goby , etc . ; finally , some fish of larger proportions : a one - meter jack with a prominent head , several fine bonito from the genus scomber decked out in the colors blue and silver , and three magnificent tuna whose high speeds could n't save them from our trawl .",124
"the grave was then covered over with the rubble dug from the seafloor , and it formed a low mound .",4
the litter was brought ; the transverse branches had been covered with leaves and long grass .,10
"herbert 's wounds , covered with compresses and lint , were pressed neither too much nor too little , so as to cause their cicatrization without effecting any inflammatory reaction .",4
"in an hour we had reached the islet . two hours later we had completed a full circle around it . it measured four to five miles in circumference . a narrow channel separated it from a considerable shore , perhaps a continent whose limits we could n't see . the existence of this shore seemed to bear out commander maury 's hypotheses . in essence , this ingenious american has noted that between the south pole and the 60th parallel , the sea is covered with floating ice of dimensions much greater than any found in the north atlantic . from this fact he drew the conclusion that the antarctic circle must contain considerable shores , since icebergs ca n't form on the high seas but only along coastlines . according to his calculations , this frozen mass enclosing the southernmost pole forms a vast ice cap whose width must reach 4,000 kilometers .",85
"their shortest way was to cross the mercy on the ice , which then covered it .",14
"after leaving these delightful islands to the protection of the french flag , the nautilus covered about 2,000 miles from december 4 to the 11th . its navigating was marked by an encounter with an immense school of squid , unusual mollusks that are near neighbors of the cuttlefish . french fishermen give them the name "" cuckoldfish , "" and they belong to the class cephalopoda , family dibranchiata , consisting of themselves together with cuttlefish and argonauts . the naturalists of antiquity made a special study of them , and these animals furnished many ribald figures of speech for soapbox orators in the greek marketplace , as well as excellent dishes for the tables of rich citizens , if we 're to believe athenaeus , a greek physician predating galen .",15
"important changes had occurred ; great blocks of stone lay on the beach , which was also covered with a thick carpet of sea - weed , algae , and wrack .",17
"its ravages were terrible in america , europe , and asia , covering a distance of eighteen hundred miles , and extending obliquely to the equator from the thirty - fifth north parallel to the fortieth south parallel .",12
"he found him clothed in a magnificent dress covered with splendid embroidery , admiring himself before a glass .",8
"but as beautiful as it was , i could get only a quick look at this basin whose surface area comprises 2,000,000 square kilometers . even captain nemo 's personal insights were denied me , because that mystifying individual did n't appear one single time during our high - speed crossing . i estimate that the nautilus covered a track of some 600 leagues under the waves of this sea , and this voyage was accomplished in just twenty - four hours times two . departing from the waterways of greece on the morning of february 16 , we cleared the strait of gibraltar by sunrise on the 18th .",57
"the bent whalebones , imprisoned in a case of ice , and covered with a thick outer layer of fat , were placed on the border of the forest at a spot where animals usually passed on their way to the lake .",12
"clumps of australian cedars rose on the sloping banks , which were also covered with the high grass called "" tussac "" in new holland ; but the cocoanut , so abundant in the archipelagoes of the pacific , seemed to be wanting in the island , the latitude , doubtless , being too low .",13
"they perceived by the tranquillity of the sea , in which no shallows troubled the waters , by its uniform color , which was stained by no yellow shades , by the absence of even a reef , that the coast was steep and that the ocean there covered a deep abyss .",48
