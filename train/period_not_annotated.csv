""" 192,000 years , my gallant conseil , which significantly extends the biblical days of creation . what 's more , the formation of coal-- in other words , the petrification of forests swallowed by floods-- and the cooling of basaltic rocks likewise call for a much longer period of time . i might add that those ' days ' in the bible must represent whole epochs and not literally the lapse of time between two sunrises , because according to the bible itself , the sun does n't date from the first day of creation .

therefore the genuineness of a fossil human relic of the quaternary period seemed to be incontestably proved and admitted .,11
"it is true that this theory met with a most obstinate opponent in m. elie de beaumont . this high authority maintained that the soil of moulin quignon was not diluvial at all , but was of much more recent formation ; and , agreeing in that with cuvier , he refused to admit that the human species could be contemporary with the animals of the quaternary period . my uncle liedenbrock , along with the great body of the geologists , had maintained his ground , disputed , and argued , until m. elie de beaumont stood almost alone in his opinion .",67

"we knew all these details , but we were not aware that since our departure the question had advanced to farther stages . other similar maxillaries , though belonging to individuals of various types and different nations , were found in the loose grey soil of certain grottoes in france , switzerland , and belgium , as well as weapons , tools , earthen utensils , bones of children and adults . the existence therefore of man in the quaternary period seemed to become daily more certain .",80
"aramis , after a journey into lorraine , disappeared all at once , and ceased to write to his friends ; they learned at a later period through mme . de chevreuse , who told it to two or three of her intimates , that , yielding to his vocation , he had retired into a convent -- only into which , nobody knew .",26

"the musketeer could not forget the evil reports which then prevailed , and which indeed have survived them , of the procurators of the period -- meanness , stinginess , fasts ; but as , after all , excepting some few acts of economy which porthos had always found very unseasonable , the procurator ’s wife had been tolerably liberal -- that is , be it understood , for a procurator ’s wife -- he hoped to see a household of a highly comfortable kind .",24

"but at a later period a wide chasm formed diagonally from south - west to north - east , through which was gradually forced out the trachyte which was to form a mountain chain . no violence accompanied this change ; the matter thrown out was in vast quantities , and the liquid material oozing out from the abysses of the earth slowly spread in extensive plains or in hillocky masses . to this period belong the felspar , syenites , and porphyries .",4

"passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie . up to his arrival at bombay , he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there ; but , now that they were plainly whirling across india at full speed , a sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams . his old vagabond nature returned to him ; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took possession of him . he came to regard his master 's project as intended in good earnest , believed in the reality of the bet , and therefore in the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail within the designated period . already he began to worry about possible delays , and accidents which might happen on the way . he recognised himself as being personally interested in the wager , and trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable folly of the night before . being much less cool - headed than mr . fogg , he was much more restless , counting and recounting the days passed over , uttering maledictions when the train stopped , and accusing it of sluggishness , and mentally blaming mr . fogg for not having bribed the engineer . the worthy fellow was ignorant that , while it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer , it could not be done on the railway .",114
