"several hours passed . the weather was dismal , and it was very cold . fix sat motionless on a bench in the station ; he might have been thought asleep . aouda , despite the storm , kept coming out of the waiting - room , going to the end of the platform , and peering through the tempest of snow , as if to pierce the mist which narrowed the horizon around her , and to hear , if possible , some welcome sound . she heard and saw nothing . then she would return , chilled through , to issue out again after the lapse of a few moments , but always in vain .",36
""" evidently , "" said i , "" we have not landed again at our original starting point , but the storm has carried us a little higher , and if we follow the shore we shall find port gr√§uben . """,21
"his idea was still with me , because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse , nor a sand - traced effigy storms could wash away ; it was a name graven on a tablet , fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed .",23
""" but , whether it is an island or a continent , "" asked gideon spilett , "" whereabouts do you think , cyrus , this storm has thrown us ? """,26
"it was an insane idea . fortunately i controlled myself and stretched out on the bed to soothe my bodily agitation . my nerves calmed a little , but with my brain so aroused , i did a swift review of my whole existence aboard the nautilus , every pleasant or unpleasant incident that had crossed my path since i went overboard from the abraham lincoln : the underwater hunting trip , the torres strait , our running aground , the savages of papua , the coral cemetery , the suez passageway , the island of santorini , the cretan diver , the bay of vigo , atlantis , the ice bank , the south pole , our imprisonment in the ice , the battle with the devilfish , the storm in the gulf stream , the avenger , and that horrible scene of the vessel sinking with its crew . . . ! all these events passed before my eyes like backdrops unrolling upstage in a theater . in this strange setting captain nemo then grew fantastically . his features were accentuated , taking on superhuman proportions . he was no longer my equal , he was the man of the waters , the spirit of the seas .",130
"but in the midst of this snow - storm , as terrible as if it had been produced in some polar country , neither cyrus harding nor his companions could , notwithstanding their wish for it , venture forth , and they remained shut up for five days , from the 20th to the 25th of august .",8
""" sir , "" captain nemo said , showing me the instruments hanging on the walls of his stateroom , "" these are the devices needed to navigate the nautilus . here , as in the lounge , i always have them before my eyes , and they indicate my position and exact heading in the midst of the ocean . you 're familiar with some of them , such as the thermometer , which gives the temperature inside the nautilus ; the barometer , which measures the heaviness of the outside air and forecasts changes in the weather ; the humidistat , which indicates the degree of dryness in the atmosphere ; the storm glass , whose mixture decomposes to foretell the arrival of tempests ; the compass , which steers my course ; the sextant , which takes the sun 's altitude and tells me my latitude ; chronometers , which allow me to calculate my longitude ; and finally , spyglasses for both day and night , enabling me to scrutinize every point of the horizon once the nautilus has risen to the surface of the waves . """,114
"the storm of rain and wind descended upon them towards eight o'clock . with but its bit of sail , the tankadere was lifted like a feather by a wind , an idea of whose violence can scarcely be given . to compare her speed to four times that of a locomotive going on full steam would be below the truth .",1
"the whole sky was of a threatening aspect , and the first symptoms of a violent storm were clearly visible .",16
""" yes , sir , clever , daring , and invulnerable ! it fears neither the red sea 's dreadful storms nor its currents and reefs . """,20
"hoisting the jib to the mainmast by way of a storm - sail , he hove to , putting the head of the vessel towards the land .",10
"for some days the heat was overpowering , and the atmosphere , saturated with electricity , was only cleared by violent storms .",21
"the sailor strained his ears , but could hear no noise beyond those caused by the storm .",16
""" you have taken my confidence by storm , "" he continued , "" and now it is much at your service . i am simply , in my original state -- stripped of that blood - bleached robe with which christianity covers human deformity -- a cold , hard , ambitious man .",7
"the rumbling was mingled with a subterranean roar , which formed a sort of rinforzando , and died slowly away , as if some violent storm had passed through the profundities of the globe .",25
""" singular instinct ! "" returned the reporter , "" since notwithstanding the storm of rain and wind which was raging during that night , top arrived at the chimneys , dry and without a speck of mud ! """,13
"it is very possible that a storm may have driven them to the island without destroying their vessel , and that , the storm over , they went away again . """,6
"it is very possible that a storm may have driven them to the island without destroying their vessel , and that , the storm over , they went away again . """,23
"it may well be supposed that such storms , comparable to water - spouts in which were mingled rain and snow , would cause great havoc on the plateau of prospect heights .",7
"it was , beyond doubt , the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention ; for , amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements , and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm , the sound , in itself , had nothing , surely , which should have interested or disturbed me .",36
"at ten o'clock a vivid flash showed them the palisade , and as they reached the gate the storm burst forth with tremendous fury .",18

"i feel peculiar sensations , like many creatures on earth at the approach of violent atmospheric changes . the heavily voluted cumulus clouds lower gloomily and threateningly ; they wear that implacable look which i have sometimes noticed at the outbreak of a great storm . the air is heavy ; the sea is calm .",44
""" oh , mention it ! if i storm , you have the art of weeping . """,8
"at ten o'clock in the evening , the skies caught on fire . the air was streaked with violent flashes of lightning . i could n't stand this brightness , but captain nemo stared straight at it , as if to inhale the spirit of the storm . a dreadful noise filled the air , a complicated noise made up of the roar of crashing breakers , the howl of the wind , claps of thunder . the wind shifted to every point of the horizon , and the cyclone left the east to return there after passing through north , west , and south , moving in the opposite direction of revolving storms in the southern hemisphere .",113
"he motioned to me to look . an exclamation of astonishment burst from me . the north pole of the needle was turned to what we supposed to be the south . it pointed to the shore instead of to the open sea ! i shook the box , examined it again , it was in perfect condition . in whatever position i placed the box the needle pertinaciously returned to this unexpected quarter . therefore there seemed no reason to doubt that during the storm there had been a sudden change of wind unperceived by us , which had brought our raft back to the shore which we thought we had left so long a distance behind us .",85
