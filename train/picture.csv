"but the picture ? what was he to say of that ? it held the secret of his life , and told his story . it had taught him to love his own beauty . would it teach him to loathe his own soul ? would he ever look at it again ?",2,"('picture', 'portrait', 'retratar')",0
no ; it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses . the horrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it . suddenly there had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck that makes men mad . the picture had not changed . it was folly to think so .,43,"('picture', 'portrait', 'cuadrar')",1
"leaning against the walls , i dragged myself down the gangways to the lounge , whose ceiling lights were on . the furniture had been knocked over . fortunately the glass cases were solidly secured at the base and had stood fast . since we were no longer vertical , the starboard pictures were glued to the tapestries , while those to port had their lower edges hanging a foot away from the wall . so the nautilus was lying on its starboard side , completely stationary to boot .",52,"('picture', 'tableau', 'cuadro')",2
"he made no answer at first , but remained quite still . the knocking still continued and grew louder . yes , it was better to let lord henry in , and to explain to him the new life he was going to lead , to quarrel with him if it became necessary to quarrel , to part if parting was inevitable . he jumped up , drew the screen hastily across the picture , and unlocked the door .",73,"('picture', 'portrait', 'cuadrar')",1
"some thirty pictures by the masters , uniformly framed and separated by gleaming panoplies of arms , adorned walls on which were stretched tapestries of austere design . there i saw canvases of the highest value , the likes of which i had marveled at in private european collections and art exhibitions . the various schools of the old masters were represented by a raphael madonna , a virgin by leonardo da vinci , a nymph by correggio , a woman by titian , an adoration of the magi by veronese , an assumption of the virgin by murillo , a holbein portrait , a monk by velazquez , a martyr by ribera , a village fair by rubens , two flemish landscapes by teniers , three little genre paintings by gerard dow , metsu , and paul potter , two canvases by gericault and prud'hon , plus seascapes by backhuysen and vernet . among the works of modern art were pictures signed by delacroix , ingres , decamps , troyon , meissonier , daubigny , etc . , and some wonderful miniature statues in marble or bronze , modeled after antiquity 's finest originals , stood on their pedestals in the corners of this magnificent museum . as the nautilus 's commander had predicted , my mind was already starting to fall into that promised state of stunned amazement .",2,"('picture', 'tableau', 'cuadro')",2
"he drew the screen back into its former place in front of the picture , smiling as he did so , and passed into his bedroom , where his valet was already waiting for him . an hour later he was at the opera , and lord henry was leaning over his chair .",13,"('picture', 'portrait', 'retratar')",0
""" you know the picture is yours , dorian . i gave it to you before it existed . """,4,"('picture', 'tableau', 'cuadrar')",3

"the painter bit his lip and walked over , cup in hand , to the picture . "" i shall stay with the real dorian , "" he said , sadly .",15,"('picture', 'portrait', 'cuadrar')",1
""" basil , "" he said , coming over quite close and looking him straight in the face , "" we have each of us a secret . let me know yours , and i shall tell you mine . what was your reason for refusing to exhibit my picture ? """,49,"('picture', 'portrait', 'retratar')",0
"the painter shuddered in spite of himself . "" dorian , if i told you , you might like me less than you do , and you would certainly laugh at me . i could not bear your doing either of those two things . if you wish me never to look at your picture again , i am content . i have always you to look at . if you wish the best work i have ever done to be hidden from the world , i am satisfied . your friendship is dearer to me than any fame or reputation . """,54,"('picture', 'portrait', 'cuadrar')",1
""" let us sit down , dorian , "" said the painter , looking troubled . "" let us sit down . and just answer me one question . have you noticed in the picture something curious?--something that probably at first did not strike you , but that revealed itself to you suddenly ? """,34,"('picture', 'portrait', 'cuadrar')",1
"it was possible , i reflected , that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene , of the details of the picture , would be sufficient to modify , or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression ; and , acting upon this idea , i reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling , and gazed down — but with a shudder even more thrilling than before — upon the remodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge , and the ghastly tree - stems , and the vacant and eye - like windows .",24,"('picture', 'tableau', 'cuadrar')",3
"dorian shook his head . "" you must not ask me that , basil . i could not possibly let you stand in front of that picture . """,26,"('picture', 'tableau', 'cuadrar')",3
""" why , what did you expect , dorian ? you did n't see anything else in the picture , did you ? there was nothing else to see ? """,18,"('picture', 'tableau', 'cuadrar')",3
""" pleasanter for you , i am afraid , "" murmured hallward regretfully . "" and now good - bye . i am sorry you wo n't let me look at the picture once again . but that ca n't be helped . i quite understand what you feel about it . """,32,"('picture', 'tableau', 'cuadrar')",3
"he shuddered , and for a moment he regretted that he had not told basil the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away . basil would have helped him to resist lord henry 's influence , and the still more poisonous influences that came from his own temperament . the love that he bore him -- for it was really love-- had nothing in it that was not noble and intellectual . it was not that mere physical admiration of beauty that is born of the senses and that dies when the senses tire . it was such love as michelangelo had known , and montaigne , and winckelmann , and shakespeare himself . yes , basil could have saved him . but it was too late now . the past could always be annihilated . regret , denial , or forgetfulness could do that . but the future was inevitable . there were passions in him that would find their terrible outlet , dreams that would make the shadow of their evil real .",25,"('picture', 'tableau', 'retratar')",4
""" i am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming round , mr . hubbard . i shall certainly drop in and look at the frame-- though i do n't go in much at present for religious art -- but to - day i only want a picture carried to the top of the house for me . it is rather heavy , so i thought i would ask you to lend me a couple of your men . """,50,"('picture', 'tableau', 'cuadrar')",3
""" there will be no difficulty , sir , "" said the genial frame - maker , beginning , with the aid of his assistant , to unhook the picture from the long brass chains by which it was suspended . "" and , now , where shall we carry it to , mr . gray ? """,29,"('picture', 'tableau', 'cuadrar')",3
"he held the door open for them , and they passed out into the hall and began the ascent . the elaborate character of the frame had made the picture extremely bulky , and now and then , in spite of the obsequious protests of mr . hubbard , who had the true tradesman 's spirited dislike of seeing a gentleman doing anything useful , dorian put his hand to it so as to help them .",29,"('picture', 'tableau', 'retratar')",4
"he wondered if he had met the men in the hall as they were leaving the house and had wormed out of them what they had been doing . he would be sure to miss the picture -- had no doubt missed it already , while he had been laying the tea - things . the screen had not been set back , and a blank space was visible on the wall . perhaps some night he might find him creeping upstairs and trying to force the door of the room . it was a horrible thing to have a spy in one 's house . he had heard of rich men who had been blackmailed all their lives by some servant who had read a letter , or overheard a conversation , or picked up a card with an address , or found beneath a pillow a withered flower or a shred of crumpled lace .",36,"('picture', 'tableau', 'cuadrar')",3
"after a few years he could not endure to be long out of england , and gave up the villa that he had shared at trouville with lord henry , as well as the little white walled - in house at algiers where they had more than once spent the winter . he hated to be separated from the picture that was such a part of his life , and was also afraid that during his absence some one might gain access to the room , in spite of the elaborate bars that he had caused to be placed upon the door .",59,"('picture', 'tableau', 'retratar')",4
"he now furtively raised his eyes : he glanced at me , irresolute , disturbed : he again surveyed the picture .",20,"('picture', 'portrait', 'pintura')",5
"by this time he had sat down : he had laid the picture on the table before him , and with his brow supported on both hands , hung fondly over it .",12,"('picture', 'portrait', 'retratar')",0
"amidst this hush the quartet sped ; he replaced the watch , laid the picture down , rose , and stood on the hearth .",14,"('picture', 'portrait', 'pintura')",5
"hallward glanced round him with a puzzled expression . the room looked as if it had not been lived in for years . a faded flemish tapestry , a curtained picture , an old italian cassone , and an almost empty book - case -- that was all that it seemed to contain , besides a chair and a table . as dorian gray was lighting a half - burned candle that was standing on the mantelshelf , he saw that the whole place was covered with dust and that the carpet was in holes . a mouse ran scuffling behind the wainscoting . there was a damp odour of mildew .",30,"('picture', 'tableau', 'cuadrar')",3
"it was some foul parody , some infamous ignoble satire . he had never done that . still , it was his own picture . he knew it , and he felt as if his blood had changed in a moment from fire to sluggish ice . his own picture ! what did it mean ? why had it altered ? he turned and looked at dorian gray with the eyes of a sick man . his mouth twitched , and his parched tongue seemed unable to articulate . he passed his hand across his forehead . it was dank with clammy sweat .",23,"('picture', 'tableau', 'retratar')",4
