"how strange a chequer - work of providence is the life of man ! and by what secret different springs are the affections hurried about , as different circumstances present ! to - day we love what to - morrow we hate ; to - day we seek what to - morrow we shun ; to - day we desire what to - morrow we fear , nay , even tremble at the apprehensions of . this was exemplified in me , at this time , in the most lively manner imaginable ; for i , whose only affliction was that i seemed banished from human society , that i was alone , circumscribed by the boundless ocean , cut off from mankind , and condemned to what i call silent life ; that i was as one whom heaven thought not worthy to be numbered among the living , or to appear among the rest of his creatures ; that to have seen one of my own species would have seemed to me a raising me from death to life , and the greatest blessing that heaven itself , next to the supreme blessing of salvation , could bestow ; i say , that i should now tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a man , and was ready to sink into the ground at but the shadow or silent appearance of a man having set his foot in the island .",155
"near two o'clock i was busy organizing my notes in the lounge , when the captain opened the door and appeared . i bowed to him . he gave me an almost imperceptible bow in return , without saying a word to me . i resumed my work , hoping he might give me some explanation of the previous afternoon 's events . he did nothing of the sort . i stared at him . his face looked exhausted ; his reddened eyes had n't been refreshed by sleep ; his facial features expressed profound sadness , real chagrin . he walked up and down , sat and stood , picked up a book at random , discarded it immediately , consulted his instruments without taking his customary notes , and seemed unable to rest easy for an instant .",134

"by adding all that he heard from the mouth of the young man to his own remembrances , he was enabled to form a pretty exact idea of a position of the seriousness of which , for the rest , the queen ’s letter , short but explicit , gave him the clue .",38

"cyrus harding ate a little of the grouse , and the rest was divided among his companions , who found it but a meager breakfast , for they were suffering extremely from hunger .",11
"it was just at high - water when these people came on shore ; and while they rambled about to see what kind of a place they were in , they had carelessly stayed till the tide was spent , and the water was ebbed considerably away , leaving their boat aground . they had left two men in the boat , who , as i found afterwards , having drunk a little too much brandy , fell asleep ; however , one of them waking a little sooner than the other and finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it , hallooed out for the rest , who were straggling about : upon which they all soon came to the boat : but it was past all their strength to launch her , the boat being very heavy , and the shore on that side being a soft oozy sand , almost like a quicksand . in this condition , like true seamen , who are , perhaps , the least of all mankind given to forethought , they gave it over , and away they strolled about the country again ; and i heard one of them say aloud to another , calling them off from the boat , “ why , let her alone , jack , ca n’t you ? she ’ll float next tide ; ” by which i was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of what countrymen they were .",109
"while this was doing , i sent friday with the captain ’s mate to the boat with orders to secure her , and bring away the oars and sails , which they did ; and by - and - by three straggling men , that were ( happily for them ) parted from the rest , came back upon hearing the guns fired ; and seeing the captain , who was before their prisoner , now their conqueror , they submitted to be bound also ; and so our victory was complete .",54
"though this was all but a fiction of his own , yet it had its desired effect ; atkins fell upon his knees to beg the captain to intercede with the governor for his life ; and all the rest begged of him , for god ’s sake , that they might not be sent to england .",39
"when this was done , and all safe upon deck , the captain ordered the mate , with three men , to break into the round - house , where the new rebel captain lay , who , having taken the alarm , had got up , and with two men and a boy had got firearms in their hands ; and when the mate , with a crow , split open the door , the new captain and his men fired boldly among them , and wounded the mate with a musket ball , which broke his arm , and wounded two more of the men , but killed nobody . the mate , calling for help , rushed , however , into the round - house , wounded as he was , and , with his pistol , shot the new captain through the head , the bullet entering at his mouth , and came out again behind one of his ears , so that he never spoke a word more : upon which the rest yielded , and the ship was taken effectually , without any more lives lost .",177

"nothing had changed in its interior arrangements . the prison was still a prison and its prisoners still prisoners . but , taking advantage of our slumber , the steward had cleared the table . consequently , nothing indicated any forthcoming improvement in our situation , and i seriously wondered if we were doomed to spend the rest of our lives in this cage .",57
"they dispersed about the room , reminding me , by the lightness and buoyancy of their movements , of a flock of white plumy birds . some of them threw themselves in half - reclining positions on the sofas and ottomans : some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books : the rest gathered in a group round the fire : all talked in a low but clear tone which seemed habitual to them .",55
