""" my dear gladys , i would not alter either name for the world . they are both perfect . i was thinking chiefly of flowers . yesterday i cut an orchid , for my button - hole . it was a marvellous spotted thing , as effective as the seven deadly sins . in a thoughtless moment i asked one of the gardeners what it was called . he told me it was a fine specimen of robinsoniana , or something dreadful of that kind . it is a sad truth , but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to things . names are everything . i never quarrel with actions . my one quarrel is with words . that is the reason i hate vulgar realism in literature . the man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one . it is the only thing he is fit for .

""" oh , never mind him . people like him get over the ground without a thought . there is so little action in this man that he will never get tired ; and besides , if he wants it , he shall have my horse . i shall get cramped if i do n't have a little action . the arms are all right , but the legs want exercise .

"on the right bank of the river grew magnificent specimens of the ulmaceae tribe , the precious elm , so valuable to builders , and which withstands well the action of water .",29
it was at this moment that people came flocking to the scene of action from all sides .,13
"part of the night passed without incident . we kept watch for an opportunity to take action . we talked little , being too keyed up . ned land was all for jumping overboard . i forced him to wait . as i saw it , the nautilus would attack the double - decker on the surface of the waves , and then it would be not only possible but easy to escape .",16
"gregson and lestrade had watched the manoeuvres of their amateur companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt . they evidently failed to appreciate the fact , which i had begun to realize , that sherlock holmes ' smallest actions were all directed towards some definite and practical end .",38
"i understood this maneuver . it was too late to take action . the nautilus was n't going to strike the double - decker where it was clad in impenetrable iron armor , but below its waterline , where the metal carapace no longer protected its planking .",11
"but as m. de toiras gave information that everything was preparing in the enemy ’s camp for a fresh assault , the king judged that it would be best to put an end to the affair , and gave the necessary orders for a decisive action .",45
""" it was my game to watch stapleton . it was evident , however , that i could not do this if i were with you , since he would be keenly on his guard . i deceived everybody , therefore , yourself included , and i came down secretly when i was supposed to be in london . my hardships were not so great as you imagined , though such trifling details must never interfere with the investigation of a case . i stayed for the most part at coombe tracey , and only used the hut upon the moor when it was necessary to be near the scene of action . cartwright had come down with me , and in his disguise as a country boy he was of great assistance to me . i was dependent upon him for food and clean linen . when i was watching stapleton , cartwright was frequently watching you , so that i was able to keep my hand upon all the strings .",111
"he who is mistaken in an action which he sincerely believes to be right may be an enemy , but retains our esteem .",6
passepartout had a moist sensation about the eyes ; his master 's action touched his susceptible heart .,12
"yet hans did not think it prudent to spend the night upon the sides of the cone . we continued our zigzag climb . the fifteen hundred remaining feet took us five hours to clear ; the circuitous route , the diagonal and the counter marches , must have measured at least three leagues . i could stand it no longer . i was yielding to the effects of hunger and cold . the rarefied air scarcely gave play to the action of my lungs .",81
the action was more frank and fearless than any i was habituated to indulge in : somehow it pleased her .,1
"his action was alternately vivacious and sullen . his voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision ( when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance ) to that species of energetic concision — that abrupt , weighty , unhurried , and hollow - sounding enunciation — that leaden , self - balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance , which may be observed in the lost drunkard , or the irreclaimable eater of opium , during the periods of his most intense excitement .",1
the taking of the capital of the confederates must have been the last action of this terrible struggle .,13
"in a state between sleeping and waking , you noticed her entrance and her actions ; but feverish , almost delirious as you were , you ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her own : the long dishevelled hair , the swelled black face , the exaggerated stature , were figments of imagination ; results of nightmare : the spiteful tearing of the veil was real : and it is like her .",14
"i share maury 's view , and i was able to study the phenomenon in this exclusive setting where ships rarely go . above us , huddled among the brown weeds , there floated objects originating from all over : tree trunks ripped from the rocky mountains or the andes and sent floating down the amazon or the mississippi , numerous pieces of wreckage , remnants of keels or undersides , bulwarks staved in and so weighed down with seashells and barnacles , they could n't rise to the surface of the ocean . and the passing years will someday bear out maury 's other view that by collecting in this way over the centuries , these substances will be turned to stone by the action of the waters and will then form inexhaustible coalfields . valuable reserves prepared by farseeing nature for that time when man will have exhausted his mines on the continents .",125
"miss miller was more ordinary ; ruddy in complexion , though of a careworn countenance ; hurried in gait and action , like one who had always a multiplicity of tasks on hand : she looked , indeed , what i afterwards found she really was , an under - teacher .",20
"d’artagnan , in fact , heard a great noise on the side next the cellar . he rose , and preceded by the host wringing his hands , and followed by planchet with his musketoon ready for use , he approached the scene of action .",44
""" i will now cut one of these pills in two , "" said holmes , and drawing his penknife he suited the action to the word . "" one half we return into the box for future purposes . the other half i will place in this wine glass , in which is a teaspoonful of water . you perceive that our friend , the doctor , is right , and that it readily dissolves . """,23
"as to going home , shame opposed the best motions that offered to my thoughts , and it immediately occurred to me how i should be laughed at among the neighbours , and should be ashamed to see , not my father and mother only , but even everybody else ; from whence i have since often observed , how incongruous and irrational the common temper of mankind is , especially of youth , to that reason which ought to guide them in such cases — viz . that they are not ashamed to sin , and yet are ashamed to repent ; not ashamed of the action for which they ought justly to be esteemed fools , but are ashamed of the returning , which only can make them be esteemed wise men .",107
""" yet it is evident that the surface of the globe has been subject to the action of fire , "" i replied , "" and it is quite reasonable to suppose that the external crust cooled down first , whilst the heat took refuge down to the centre . """,16
"so i begged ned to let me think about it before taking action . if this measure proved fruitless , it could arouse the captain 's suspicions , make our circumstances even more arduous , and jeopardize the canadian 's plans . i might add that i could hardly use our state of health as an argument . except for that grueling ordeal under the ice bank at the south pole , we had never felt better , neither ned , conseil , nor i. the nutritious food , life - giving air , regular routine , and uniform temperature kept illness at bay ; and for a man who did n't miss his past existence on land , for a captain nemo who was at home here , who went where he wished , who took paths mysterious to others if not himself in attaining his ends , i could understand such a life . but we ourselves had n't severed all ties with humanity . for my part , i did n't want my new and unusual research to be buried with my bones . i had now earned the right to pen the definitive book on the sea , and sooner or later i wanted that book to see the light of day .",12
"ah ! women and young girls , how incomprehensible are your feminine hearts ! when you are not the timidest , you are the bravest of creatures . reason has nothing to do with your actions . what ! did this child encourage me in such an expedition ! would she not be afraid to join it herself ? and she was driving me to it , one whom she loved !",35
"i pass over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on the character of my beloved ; indeed , when you are far away , janet , i 'll try to forget it : i shall notice only its wisdom ; which is such that i have made it my law of action .",53
it was better that the colonists should be together at the moment when they were about to engage in a decisive action .,21
"this note was in the first place a forgery ; it was likewise an indelicacy . it was even , according to our present manners , something like an infamous action ; but at that period people did not manage affairs as they do today .",30
""" well , we 've got to accept ! "" the canadian answered . "" once we 're on solid ground , we 'll figure out a course of action . besides , it would n't pain me to eat a couple slices of fresh venison ! """,29
"the recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very dim in my mind . i can recall some sensations felt in that interval ; but few thoughts framed , and no actions performed .",34
"on january 16 the nautilus seemed to have fallen asleep just a few meters beneath the surface of the water . its electric equipment had been turned off , and the motionless propeller let it ride with the waves . i assumed that the crew were busy with interior repairs , required by the engine 's strenuous mechanical action .",58
"having once explained to them that i could not now be explicit about my plans , they kindly and wisely acquiesced in the silence with which i pursued them , according to me the privilege of free action i should under similar circumstances have accorded them .",37
"it is far better to endure patiently a smart which nobody feels but yourself , than to commit a hasty action whose evil consequences will extend to all connected with you ; and besides , the bible bids us return good for evil . """,20
"herbert and gideon spilett , who were just about to set out hunting , left their guns , pencroft threw down his ax , and harding and neb joining their companions , all rushed towards the scene of action .",38
""" so be it . i 'll see him today , "" i answered the canadian , who , if he took action himself , would certainly have ruined everything .",22
"in three hours i had seen not only the town but its environs . the general aspect was wonderfully dull . no trees , and scarcely any vegetation . everywhere bare rocks , signs of volcanic action . the icelandic huts are made of earth and turf , and the walls slope inward ; they rather resemble roofs placed on the ground . but then these roofs are meadows of comparative fertility . thanks to the internal heat , the grass grows on them to some degree of perfection . it is carefully mown in the hay season ; if it were not , the horses would come to pasture on these green abodes .",36
""" i 'll sit down , with your leave , "" the prisoner said , suiting the action to the word . "" this aneurism of mine makes me easily tired , and the tussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters . i 'm on the brink of the grave , and i am not likely to lie to you . every word i say is the absolute truth , and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to me . """,17
"every quarter of an hour we were obliged to halt , to take a little necessary repose and restore the action of our limbs . we then sat down upon a fragment of rock , and we talked as we ate and drank from the stream .",20
"teachers , you must watch her : keep your eyes on her movements , weigh well her words , scrutinise her actions , punish her body to save her soul : if , indeed , such salvation be possible , for ( my tongue falters while i tell it ) this girl , this child , the native of a christian land , worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to brahma and kneels before juggernaut -- this girl is -- a liar ! """,21
"but it was in the air that life was superabundant . there various species of birds flew and fluttered by the thousands , deafening us with their calls . crowding the rocks , other fowl watched without fear as we passed and pressed familiarly against our feet . these were auks , as agile and supple in water , where they are sometimes mistaken for fast bonito , as they are clumsy and heavy on land . they uttered outlandish calls and participated in numerous public assemblies that featured much noise but little action .",93
