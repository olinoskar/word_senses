"the _ valkyria _ kept at some distance from the coast , taking a westerly course amidst great shoals of whales and sharks . soon we came in sight of an enormous perforated rock , through which the sea dashed furiously . the westman islets seemed to rise out of the ocean like a group of rocks in a liquid plain . from that time the schooner took a wide berth and swept at a great distance round cape rejkianess , which forms the western point of iceland .",33

"often these chains of barren rocks made a dip towards the sea , and encroached upon the scanty pasturage : but there was always enough room to pass . besides , our horses instinctively chose the easiest places without ever slackening their pace . my uncle was refused even the satisfaction of stirring up his beast with whip or voice . he had no excuse for being impatient . i could not help smiling to see so tall a man on so small a pony , and as his long legs nearly touched the ground he looked like a six - legged centaur .",5

""" it is difficult to speak decidedly , uncle , for all these rocks are so very much alike . yet i think i recognise the promontory at the foot of which hans constructed our launch . we must be very near the little port , if indeed this is not it , "" i added , examining a creek which i thought i recognised .",13
"and so we arrived at a place where the shore was much narrowed . here the sea came to lap the foot of the steep cliff , leaving a passage no wider than a couple of yards . between two boldly projecting rocks appeared the mouth of a dark tunnel .",42
"the wind was unfavourable to a species of launch not calculated for shallow water . in many places we were obliged to push ourselves along with iron - pointed sticks . often the sunken rocks just beneath the surface obliged us to deviate from our straight course . at last , after three hours ' sailing , about six in the evening we reached a place suitable for our landing . i jumped ashore , followed by my uncle and the icelander . this short passage had not served to cool my ardour . on the contrary , i even proposed to burn ' our ship , ' to prevent the possibility of return ; but my uncle would not consent to that . i thought him singularly lukewarm .",34
"i begged for the honour of lighting the fuse . this duty done , i was to join my companions on the raft , which had not yet been unloaded ; we should then push off as far as we could and avoid the dangers arising from the explosion , the effects of which were not likely to be confined to the rock itself .",62
""" two ! one ! down , granite rocks ; down with you . """,8
"on the other side of the blown - up rock was an abyss . the explosion had caused a kind of earthquake in this fissured and abysmal region ; a great gulf had opened ; and the sea , now changed into a torrent , was hurrying us along into it .",9
"in the midst of this moving vegetation , under arbors of water plants , there raced legions of clumsy articulates , in particular some fanged frog crabs whose carapaces form a slightly rounded triangle , robber crabs exclusive to these waterways , and horrible parthenope crabs whose appearance was repulsive to the eye . one animal no less hideous , which i encountered several times , was the enormous crab that mr . darwin observed , to which nature has given the instinct and requisite strength to eat coconuts ; it scrambles up trees on the beach and sends the coconuts tumbling ; they fracture in their fall and are opened by its powerful pincers . here , under these clear waves , this crab raced around with matchless agility , while green turtles from the species frequenting the malabar coast moved sluggishly among the crumbling rocks .",146
"near seven o'clock we finally surveyed the bank of shellfish , where pearl oysters reproduce by the millions . these valuable mollusks stick to rocks , where they 're strongly attached by a mass of brown filaments that forbids their moving about . in this respect oysters are inferior even to mussels , to whom nature has not denied all talent for locomotion .",24
"not without cause was this sentiment : mrs . reed looked frightened ; her work had slipped from her knee ; she was lifting up her hands , rocking herself to and fro , and even twisting her face as if she would cry .",28
"but we could n't stop . we had to follow the captain , who headed down trails seemingly known only to himself . the seafloor rose noticeably , and when i lifted my arms , sometimes they would pass above the surface of the sea . then the level of the oysterbank would lower unpredictably . often we went around tall , pointed rocks rising like pyramids . in their dark crevices huge crustaceans , aiming their long legs like heavy artillery , watched us with unblinking eyes , while underfoot there crept millipedes , bloodworms , aricia worms , and annelid worms , whose antennas and tubular tentacles were incredibly long .",63
"what could be the meaning of such a change ? up to this time facts had supported the theories of davy and of liedenbrock ; until now particular conditions of non - conducting rocks , electricity and magnetism , had tempered the laws of nature , giving us only a moderately warm climate , for the theory of a central fire remained in my estimation the only one that was true and explicable . were we then turning back to where the phenomena of central heat ruled in all their rigour and would reduce the most refractory rocks to the state of a molten liquid ? i feared this , and said to the professor :",33

""" what ! "" i shouted . "" are we being taken up in an eruption ? our fate has flung us here among burning lavas , molten rocks , boiling waters , and all kinds of volcanic matter ; we are going to be pitched out , expelled , tossed up , vomited , spit out high into the air , along with fragments of rock , showers of ashes and scoria , in the midst of a towering rush of smoke and flames ; and it is the best thing that could happen to us ! """,28
"after leaving this gulf we raised muscat for an instant , the most important town in the country of oman . i marveled at its strange appearance in the midst of the black rocks surrounding it , against which the white of its houses and forts stood out sharply . i spotted the rounded domes of its mosques , the elegant tips of its minarets , and its fresh , leafy terraces . but it was only a fleeting vision , and the nautilus soon sank beneath the dark waves of these waterways .",33
"then the nautilus drew near the beaches of africa , where the sea is considerably deeper . there , through the open panels and in a midwater of crystal clarity , our ship enabled us to study wonderful bushes of shining coral and huge chunks of rock wrapped in splendid green furs of algae and fucus . what an indescribable sight , and what a variety of settings and scenery where these reefs and volcanic islands leveled off by the libyan coast ! but soon the nautilus hugged the eastern shore where these tree forms appeared in all their glory . this was off the coast of tihama , and there such zoophyte displays not only flourished below sea level but they also fashioned picturesque networks that unreeled as high as ten fathoms above it ; the latter were more whimsical but less colorful than the former , which kept their bloom thanks to the moist vitality of the waters .",46
"so i called conseil to my side , while at an average depth of eight to nine meters , the nautilus slowly skimmed every beautiful rock on the easterly coast .",25
"we could not even suppose that after it had stayed for any length of time on the shore , it would have been swept off by the sea , for the south coast is all rocks , and it would certainly have been smashed to pieces there ! """,35
"at nightfall he did not return to the room assigned to him , but remained under some clump of trees , or when the weather was bad crouched in some cleft of the rocks .",33
"the turn of the rocks sheltered them from the wind , and they could breathe after this walk or rather run of a quarter of an hour .",4
"the canoe followed the windings of the shore , avoiding the rocks which fringed it , and which the rising tide began to cover .",11
"this was formed of granite rocks , capriciously distributed , very different from the cliff at prospect heights , and of an extremely wild aspect .",5
it might have been said that an immense cartload of rocks had been emptied out there .,10
"she slept as a prisoner sleeps , rocked by his first hope .",7
