""" you do n't understand me , harry , "" answered the artist . "" of course i am not like him . i know that perfectly well . indeed , i should be sorry to look like him . you shrug your shoulders ? i am telling you the truth . there is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction , the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings . it is better not to be different from one 's fellows . the ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world . they can sit at their ease and gape at the play . if they know nothing of victory , they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat . they live as we all should live -- undisturbed , indifferent , and without disquiet . they neither bring ruin upon others , nor ever receive it from alien hands . your rank and wealth , harry ; my brains , such as they are -- my art , whatever it may be worth ; dorian gray 's good looks -- we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us , suffer terribly .

"' oh , i beg your pardon !

"then -- but i do n't know how to explain it to you . something seemed to tell me that i was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life . i had a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and exquisite sorrows . i grew afraid and turned to quit the room . it was not conscience that made me do so : it was a sort of cowardice . i take no credit to myself for trying to escape .

"on the morning of the 24th , in latitude 12 degrees 5 ' south and longitude 94 degrees 33 ' , we raised keeling island , a madreporic upheaving planted with magnificent coconut trees , which had been visited by mr . darwin and captain fitzroy . the nautilus cruised along a short distance off the shore of this desert island . our dragnets brought up many specimens of polyps and echinoderms plus some unusual shells from the branch mollusca . captain nemo 's treasures were enhanced by some valuable exhibits from the delphinula snail species , to which i joined some pointed star coral , a sort of parasitic polypary that often attaches itself to seashells .",107
"among the various fish inhabiting it , some i viewed , others i glimpsed , and the rest i missed completely because of the nautilus 's speed . kindly allow me to sort them out using this whimsical system of classification . it will at least convey the quickness of my observations .",32

""" no : you are very well ; and much improved of late ; and mr . rochester , i daresay , is fond of you . i have always noticed that you were a sort of pet of his . there are times when , for your sake , i have been a little uneasy at his marked preference , and have wished to put you on your guard : but i did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong .",35
"i stood amazed . my uncle had uplifted his long arms to the vault which was our sky ; his mouth gaping wide , his eyes flashing behind his shining spectacles , his head balancing with an up - and - down motion , his whole attitude denoted unlimited astonishment . here he stood facing an immense collection of scattered leptotheria , mericotheria , lophiodia , anoplotheria , megatheria , mastodons , protopithecæ , pterodactyles , and all sorts of extinct monsters here assembled together for his special satisfaction . fancy an enthusiastic bibliomaniac suddenly brought into the midst of the famous alexandrian library burnt by omar and restored by a miracle from its ashes ! just such a crazed enthusiast was my uncle , professor liedenbrock .",78
