harding and his companions mounted on the platform .,7,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"followed by captain nemo , i climbed onto the platform , and from there my eyes eagerly scanned the horizon .",9,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"by then the ironclad was no more than three miles off . despite its violent cannonade , captain nemo had n't appeared on the platform . and yet if one of those conical shells had scored a routine hit on the nautilus 's hull , it could have been fatal to him .",24,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"emerging from the strait of gibraltar , the nautilus took to the high seas . it returned to the surface of the waves , so our daily strolls on the platform were restored to us .",30,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"and in the bow of the platform , captain nemo unfurled a black flag , like the one he had left planted at the south pole .",6,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"the next day , march 21 , bright and early at five o'clock in the morning , i climbed onto the platform . i found captain nemo there .",21,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"several hours passed . the weather was dismal , and it was very cold . fix sat motionless on a bench in the station ; he might have been thought asleep . aouda , despite the storm , kept coming out of the waiting - room , going to the end of the platform , and peering through the tempest of snow , as if to pierce the mist which narrowed the horizon around her , and to hear , if possible , some welcome sound . she heard and saw nothing . then she would return , chilled through , to issue out again after the lapse of a few moments , but always in vain .",53,"('platform', 'quai', 'andén')",1
"i repaired to my stateroom . the captain and his chief officer stayed on the platform . the propeller was set in motion . the nautilus swiftly retreated , putting us outside the range of the vessel 's shells . but the chase continued , and captain nemo was content to keep his distance .",15,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"near four o'clock in the afternoon , unable to control the impatience and uneasiness devouring me , i went back to the central companionway . the hatch was open . i ventured onto the platform . the captain was still strolling there , his steps agitated . he stared at the ship , which stayed to his leeward five or six miles off . he was circling it like a wild beast , drawing it eastward , letting it chase after him . yet he did n't attack . was he , perhaps , still undecided ?",34,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"at three o'clock in the morning , full of uneasiness , i climbed onto the platform . captain nemo had n't left it . he stood in the bow next to his flag , which a mild breeze was unfurling above his head . his eyes never left that vessel . the extraordinary intensity of his gaze seemed to attract it , beguile it , and draw it more surely than if he had it in tow !",15,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
""" basil , "" cried dorian gray , "" if lord henry wotton goes , i shall go , too . you never open your lips while you are painting , and it is horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant . ask him to stay . i insist upon it . """,39,"('platform', 'plate', 'estrado')",2
"the painter laughed . "" i do n't think there will be any difficulty about that . sit down again , harry . and now , dorian , get up on the platform , and do n't move about too much , or pay any attention to what lord henry says . he has a very bad influence over all his friends , with the single exception of myself . """,32,"('platform', 'plate', 'estrado')",2
"taking advantage of this situation , my two companions and i found seats on the ever - deserted platform . in front of us stood the pilothouse , and unless i 'm extremely mistaken , captain nemo must have been inside , steering his nautilus himself .",18,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"when i stood up , i saw captain nemo and his chief officer on the platform . they were examining the ship 's circumstances , exchanging a few words in their incomprehensible dialect .",15,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"as they entered the studio , dorian gray put his hand upon lord henry 's arm . "" in that case , let our friendship be a caprice , "" he murmured , flushing at his own boldness , then stepped up on the platform and resumed his pose .",44,"('platform', 'plate', 'estrado')",2
""" is it really finished ? "" he murmured , stepping down from the platform .",14,"('platform', 'plate', 'estrado')",2
"my mind was made up . the canadian left me . i went out on the platform , where i could barely stand upright against the jolts of the billows . the skies were threatening , but land lay inside those dense mists , and we had to escape . not a single day , or even a single hour , could we afford to lose .",16,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"the next day , january 5 , after its deck paneling was opened , the skiff was wrenched from its socket and launched to sea from the top of the platform . two men were sufficient for this operation . the oars were inside the longboat and we had only to take our seats .",30,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"i could hardly wait until our position was reported on the chart . near 11:30 the ballast tanks emptied , and the submersible rose to the surface of the ocean . i leaped onto the platform . ned land was already there .",35,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"after passing the well of the companionway that led to the platform , i saw a cabin 2 meters long in which conseil and ned land , enraptured with their meal , were busy devouring it to the last crumb . then a door opened into the galley , 3 meters long and located between the vessel 's huge storage lockers .",11,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"i set foot on the platform and waited . the darkness was so profound i could n't see even captain nemo . however , looking at the zenith directly overhead , i thought i caught sight of a feeble glimmer , a sort of twilight filtering through a circular hole . just then the beacon suddenly went on , and its intense brightness made that hazy light vanish .",5,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"i thanked the captain and went to look for my two companions , who had n't yet left their cabin . i invited them to follow me , not telling them where we were . they climbed onto the platform . conseil , whom nothing could startle , saw it as a perfectly natural thing to fall asleep under the waves and wake up under a mountain . but ned land had no idea in his head other than to see if this cavern offered some way out .",39,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"and athos ran back to the bastion , mounted the platform , and bore off the flag ; but as the rochellais had arrived within musket range , they opened a terrible fire upon this man , who appeared to expose himself for pleasure ’s sake .",10,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"at certain turns in the trail we were going along , the lake appeared in its full expanse . the ship 's beacon lit up that whole placid surface , which experienced neither ripples nor undulations . the nautilus lay perfectly still . on its platform and on the embankment , crewmen were bustling around , black shadows that stood out clearly in the midst of the luminous air .",45,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"i made my way to the central companionway , which led to the platform . i climbed its metal steps , passed through the open hatches , and arrived topside on the nautilus .",13,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"the platform emerged only eighty centimeters above the waves . the nautilus 's bow and stern boasted that spindle - shaped outline that had caused the ship to be compared appropriately to a long cigar . i noted the slight overlap of its sheet - iron plates , which resembled the scales covering the bodies of our big land reptiles . so i had a perfectly natural explanation for why , despite the best spyglasses , this boat had always been mistaken for a marine animal .",1,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"near the middle of the platform , the skiff was half set in the ship 's hull , making a slight bulge . fore and aft stood two cupolas of moderate height , their sides slanting and partly inset with heavy biconvex glass , one reserved for the helmsman steering the nautilus , the other for the brilliance of the powerful electric beacon lighting his way .",5,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"our strength returned promptly , and when i looked around , i saw that we were alone on the platform . no crewmen . not even captain nemo . those strange seamen on the nautilus were content with the oxygen circulating inside . not one of them had come up to enjoy the open air .",19,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"how i got onto the platform i 'm unable to say . perhaps the canadian transferred me there . but i could breathe , i could inhale the life - giving sea air . next to me my two companions were getting tipsy on the fresh oxygen particles . poor souls who have suffered from long starvation must n't pounce heedlessly on the first food given them . we , on the other hand , did n't have to practice such moderation : we could suck the atoms from the air by the lungful , and it was the breeze , the breeze itself , that poured into us this luxurious intoxication !",5,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"at noon that day after our position fix , captain nemo climbed onto the platform , where i happened to be . i vowed not to let him go below again without at least sounding him out on his future plans . as soon as he saw me , he came over , graciously offered me a cigar , and said to me :",14,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"in two minutes we were on the strand . loading provisions and weapons into the skiff , pushing it to sea , and positioning its two oars were the work of an instant . we had n't gone two cable lengths when a hundred savages , howling and gesticulating , entered the water up to their waists . i looked to see if their appearance might draw some of the nautilus 's men onto the platform . but no . lying well out , that enormous machine still seemed completely deserted .",75,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"by then all our past sufferings were forgotten . the memory of that imprisonment under the ice faded from our minds . we had thoughts only of the future . captain nemo no longer appeared , neither in the lounge nor on the platform . the positions reported each day on the world map were put there by the chief officer , and they enabled me to determine the nautilus 's exact heading . now then , that evening it became obvious , much to my satisfaction , that we were returning north by the atlantic route .",43,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"i climbed onto the platform . night had already fallen , because in this low latitude the sun sets quickly , without any twilight . i could see gueboroa island only dimly . but numerous fires had been kindled on the beach , attesting that the natives had no thoughts of leaving it .",4,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"at six o'clock in the morning , january 8 , i climbed onto the platform . the morning shadows were lifting . the island was soon on view through the dissolving mists , first its beaches , then its summits .",14,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"fix , who had followed mr . fogg to the station , and saw that he was really going to leave bombay , was there , upon the platform . he had resolved to follow the supposed robber to calcutta , and farther , if necessary . passepartout did not observe the detective , who stood in an obscure corner ; but fix heard him relate his adventures in a few words to mr . fogg .",28,"('platform', 'quai', 'andén')",1
our friends had already secured a first - class carriage and were waiting for us upon the platform .,17,"('platform', 'quai', 'andén')",1
"with ned and conseil , i went to sit on the platform . the coast to the east looked like a slightly blurred mass in a damp fog .",11,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"we were seated on the platform next to a tranquil sea . the month of march , since it 's the equivalent of october in these latitudes , was giving us some fine autumn days . it was the canadian-- on this topic he was never mistaken -- who sighted a baleen whale on the eastern horizon . if you looked carefully , you could see its blackish back alternately rise and fall above the waves , five miles from the nautilus .",5,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"i looked back at the platform when we had left it far behind , and saw the tall , austere figure of holmes standing motionless and gazing after us .",5,"('platform', 'quai', 'andén')",1
""" but if these papuans are occupying the platform at that moment , i do n't see how you can prevent them from entering . """,8,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"early in the morning on november 11 , fresh air poured through the nautilus 's interior , informing me that we had returned to the surface of the ocean to renew our oxygen supply . i headed for the central companionway and climbed onto the platform .",45,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"so i was marveling at this delightful sunrise , so life - giving and cheerful , when i heard someone climbing onto the platform .",23,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
five days passed in this way with no change in our situation . every morning i climbed onto the platform . the same phrase was pronounced by the same individual . captain nemo did not appear .,19,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"just then , as mute and emotionless as ever , seven crewmen climbed onto the platform . one carried a harpoon and line similar to those used in whale fishing . its deck paneling opened , the skiff was wrenched from its socket and launched to sea . six rowers sat on the thwarts , and the coxswain took the tiller . ned , conseil , and i found seats in the stern .",15,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"it took pulleys of great strength to hoist this dugong onto the platform . the beast weighed 5,000 kilograms . it was carved up in sight of the canadian , who remained to watch every detail of the operation . at dinner the same day , my steward served me some slices of this flesh , skillfully dressed by the ship 's cook . i found it excellent , even better than veal if not beef .",12,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"at 9:15 when our boat returned to the surface , i climbed onto the platform . i was quite impatient to clear captain nemo 's tunnel , could n't sit still , and wanted to breathe the fresh night air .",14,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"it happened the morning of january 15 . the captain , with whom i was strolling on the platform , asked me if i knew how salt water differs in density from sea to sea . i said no , adding that there was a lack of rigorous scientific observations on this subject .",18,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"captain nemo led me to the central companionway . in midstair he opened a door , went along the upper gangways , and arrived at the wheelhouse , which , as you know , stands at one end of the platform .",40,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"the cabin was dark ; but my eyes soon grew accustomed to its darkness and i saw the pilot , a muscular man whose hands rested on the pegs of the wheel . outside , the sea was brightly lit by the beacon shining behind the cabin at the other end of the platform .",53,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
finally this mass of sperm whales thinned out . the waves grew tranquil again . i felt us rising to the surface of the ocean . the hatch opened and we rushed onto the platform .,34,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"at sunrise the next morning , february 12 , the nautilus rose to the surface of the waves . i rushed onto the platform . the hazy silhouette of pelusium was outlined three miles to the south . a torrent had carried us from one sea to the other . but although that tunnel was easy to descend , going back up must have been impossible .",23,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"i had climbed onto the platform just as the chief officer was taking his readings of hour angles . out of habit i waited for him to pronounce his daily phrase . but that day it was replaced by a different phrase , just as incomprehensible . almost at once i saw captain nemo appear , lift his spyglass , and inspect the horizon .",5,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"just as we were crowding each other to reach the platform , two more arms lashed the air , swooped on the seaman stationed in front of captain nemo , and carried the fellow away with irresistible violence . captain nemo gave a shout and leaped outside . we rushed after him .",10,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"what rage then drove us against these monsters ! we lost all self - control . ten or twelve devilfish had overrun the nautilus 's platform and sides . we piled helter - skelter into the thick of these sawed - off snakes , which darted over the platform amid waves of blood and sepia ink . it seemed as if these viscous tentacles grew back like the many heads of hydra . at every thrust ned land 's harpoon would plunge into a squid 's sea - green eye and burst it . but my daring companion was suddenly toppled by the tentacles of a monster he could not avoid .",25,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0

"meanwhile captain nemo strolled from one end of the platform to the other , not glancing at me , perhaps not even seeing me . his step was firm but less regular than usual . sometimes he would stop , cross his arms over his chest , and observe the sea . what could he be looking for over that immense expanse ? by then the nautilus lay hundreds of miles from the nearest coast !",9,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"daylight appeared . the morning mists surrounded us , but they soon broke up . i was about to proceed with a careful examination of the hull , whose topside formed a sort of horizontal platform , when i felt it sinking little by little .",35,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"near noon i was on the platform with conseil . i shared with him the relevant details on the gulf stream . when my explanation was over , i invited him to dip his hands into its current .",6,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"violent squalls assaulted us during the daytime . thanks to certain heavy mists , we could n't see from one end of the platform to the other . the wind shifted abruptly to every point on the compass . the snow was piling up in such packed layers , it had to be chipped loose with blows from picks . even in a temperature of merely -5 degrees centigrade , every outside part of the nautilus was covered with ice . a ship 's rigging would have been unusable , because all its tackle would have jammed in the grooves of the pulleys . only a craft without sails , driven by an electric motor that needed no coal , could face such high latitudes .",23,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"the blizzard lasted until the next day . it was impossible to stay on the platform . from the lounge , where i was writing up the incidents of this excursion to the polar continent , i could hear the calls of petrel and albatross cavorting in the midst of the turmoil . the nautilus did n't stay idle , and cruising along the coast , it advanced some ten miles farther south amid the half light left by the sun as it skimmed the edge of the horizon .",15,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"after renewing its air , the nautilus stayed at an average depth of fifteen meters , enabling it to return quickly to the surface of the waves . and , contrary to custom , it executed such a maneuver several times during that day of january 19 . the chief officer would then climb onto the platform , and his usual phrase would ring through the ship 's interior .",56,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"just then i was on the platform . observing the situation for some while , the captain said to me :",6,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"unshaken by these squalls , captain nemo stationed himself on the platform . he was lashed around the waist to withstand the monstrous breakers foaming over the deck . i hoisted and attached myself to the same place , dividing my wonderment between the storm and this incomparable man who faced it head - on .",11,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"by the next morning , november 18 , i was fully recovered from my exhaustion of the day before , and i climbed onto the platform just as the nautilus 's chief officer was pronouncing his daily phrase . it then occurred to me that these words either referred to the state of the sea , or that they meant : "" there 's nothing in sight . """,25,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"then i heard the sound of footsteps on the platform . i realized that the skiff was being detached and launched to sea . for an instant it bumped the nautilus 's side , then all sounds ceased .",9,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"captain nemo stopped , straightened up , took a few steps along the platform , and returned to me :",13,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"after changing clothes , i climbed onto the platform , and in the grip of dreadfully obsessive thoughts , i sat next to the beacon .",8,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"at eleven o'clock the locomotive 's whistle announced that they were approaching plum creek station . mr . fogg rose , and , followed by fix , went out upon the platform . passepartout accompanied him , carrying a pair of revolvers . aouda remained in the car , as pale as death .",31,"('platform', 'passerelle', 'galería')",3
"the door of the next car opened , and colonel proctor appeared on the platform , attended by a yankee of his own stamp as his second . but just as the combatants were about to step from the train , the conductor hurried up , and shouted , "" you ca n't get off , gentlemen ! """,14,"('platform', 'passerelle', 'galería')",3
"i rushed up onto the platform . yes , open sea ! barely a few sparse floes , some moving icebergs ; a sea stretching into the distance ; hosts of birds in the air and myriads of fish under the waters , which varied from intense blue to olive green depending on the depth . the thermometer marked 3 degrees centigrade . it was as if a comparative springtime had been locked up behind that ice bank , whose distant masses were outlined on the northern horizon .",5,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"on november 26 , at three o'clock in the morning , the nautilus cleared the tropic of cancer at longitude 172 degrees . on the 27th it passed in sight of the hawaiian islands , where the famous captain cook met his death on february 14 , 1779 . by then we had fared 4,860 leagues from our starting point . when i arrived on the platform that morning , i saw the island of hawaii two miles to leeward , the largest of the seven islands making up this group . i could clearly distinguish the tilled soil on its outskirts , the various mountain chains running parallel with its coastline , and its volcanoes , crowned by mauna kea , whose elevation is 5,000 meters above sea level . among other specimens from these waterways , our nets brought up some peacock - tailed flabellarian coral , polyps flattened into stylish shapes and unique to this part of the ocean .",66,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"the two combatants , their seconds , and the conductor passed through the cars to the rear of the train . the last car was only occupied by a dozen passengers , whom the conductor politely asked if they would not be so kind as to leave it vacant for a few moments , as two gentlemen had an affair of honour to settle . the passengers granted the request with alacrity , and straightway disappeared on the platform .",78,"('platform', 'passerelle', 'galería')",3
"that day , january 21 , 1868 , the chief officer went at noon to take the sun 's altitude . i climbed onto the platform , lit a cigar , and watched him at work . it seemed obvious to me that this man did n't understand french , because i made several remarks in a loud voice that were bound to provoke him to some involuntary show of interest had he understood them ; but he remained mute and emotionless .",25,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"i was on the platform just then . after determining our position , the captain pronounced only these words :",4,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"on january 25 , the ocean being completely deserted , the nautilus spent the day on the surface , churning the waves with its powerful propeller and making them spurt to great heights . under these conditions , who would n't have mistaken it for a gigantic cetacean ? i spent three - quarters of the day on the platform . i stared at the sea . nothing on the horizon , except near four o'clock in the afternoon a long steamer to the west , running on our opposite tack . its masting was visible for an instant , but it could n't have seen the nautilus because we were lying too low in the water . i imagine that steamboat belonged to the peninsular & oriental line , which provides service from the island of ceylon to sidney , also calling at king george sound and melbourne .",59,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
"but when the passengers counted each other on the station platform several were found missing ; among others the courageous frenchman , whose devotion had just saved them .",10,"('platform', 'quai', 'andén')",1
i left him and climbed onto the platform . conseil and the canadian were already there .,7,"('platform', 'plate', 'plataforma')",0
