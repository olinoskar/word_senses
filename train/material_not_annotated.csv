"indeed , larger blocks of ice soon appeared , their brilliance varying at the whim of the mists . some of these masses displayed green veins , as if scrawled with undulating lines of copper sulfate . others looked like enormous amethysts , letting the light penetrate their insides . the latter reflected the sun 's rays from the thousand facets of their crystals . the former , tinted with a bright limestone sheen , would have supplied enough building material to make a whole marble town .",80
"the tool , the manufacture of which presented the most difficulty , was the pipe of the glass - maker , an iron tube , five or six feet long , which collects on one end the material in a state of fusion .",37
"if you knew it , you are peculiarly situated : very near happiness ; yes , within reach of it . the materials are all prepared ; there only wants a movement to combine them . chance laid them somewhat apart ; let them be once approached and bliss results . """,22
"there fermented in that sublimated brain plans so vast , projects so tumultuous , that there remained no room for any capricious or material love -- that sentiment which is fed by leisure and grows with corruption .",23
"these americans refused to give up . the daring cyrus field , who had risked his whole fortune to promote this undertaking , called for a new bond issue . it sold out immediately . another cable was put down under better conditions . its sheaves of conducting wire were insulated within a gutta - percha covering , which was protected by a padding of textile material enclosed in a metal sheath . the great eastern put back to sea on july 13 , 1866 .",66
it had not even been necessary to resort again to the manufacture of the coarse felt materials .,16
"the musmons in the corral had been stripped of their wool , and this precious textile material was now to be transformed into stuff .",16
"and indeed he proposed to make use of the property which the filaments of wool possess when subjected to a powerful pressure of mixing together , and of manufacturing by this simple process the material called felt .",34
"this sort of material must have been known from the most ancient times , and , in fact , the first woolen stuffs were manufactured by the process which harding was now about to employ .",3
"here a question popped into my head . how did the commander of this aquatic residence go about it ? did he obtain air using chemical methods , releasing the oxygen contained in potassium chlorate by heating it , meanwhile absorbing the carbon dioxide with potassium hydroxide ? if so , he would have to keep up some kind of relationship with the shore , to come by the materials needed for such an operation . did he simply limit himself to storing the air in high - pressure tanks and then dispense it according to his crew 's needs ? perhaps . or , proceeding in a more convenient , more economical , and consequently more probable fashion , was he satisfied with merely returning to breathe at the surface of the water like a cetacean , renewing his oxygen supply every twenty - four hours ? in any event , whatever his method was , it seemed prudent to me that he use this method without delay .",69
"i saw he was of the material from which nature hews her heroes -- christian and pagan -- her lawgivers , her statesmen , her conquerors : a steadfast bulwark for great interests to rest upon ; but , at the fireside , too often a cold cumbrous column , gloomy and out of place .",6
"the road between prospect heights and the sources of the stream was already partly beaten , and with a better cart than the first , the material could be easily conveyed to the spot , especially if they could manage to capture some animals to draw it .",26
"the carriage went on , and left the two men facing each other ; no material obstacle separated them .",15
"there was no want of wood , cut up into planks , in the storeroom , and little by little they completed their furnishing ; constructing the most solid of tables and chairs , for material was not spared .",35
"and yet this nature so distinguished , this creature so beautiful , this essence so fine , was seen to turn insensibly toward material life , as old men turn toward physical and moral imbecility .",23
"some large stones , found at the north of the lake , could be easily transformed into millstones , and as to the sails , the inexhaustible case of the balloon furnished the necessary material .",34
"just then the gulf stream 's speed was 2.25 meters per second . so distinct is its current from the surrounding sea , its confined waters stand out against the ocean and operate on a different level from the colder waters . murky as well , and very rich in saline material , their pure indigo contrasts with the green waves surrounding them . moreover , their line of demarcation is so clear that abreast of the carolinas , the nautilus 's spur cut the waves of the gulf stream while its propeller was still churning those belonging to the ocean .",51
