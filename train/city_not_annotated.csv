"in every big city the monster was the latest rage ; they sang about it in the coffee houses , they ridiculed it in the newspapers , they dramatized it in the theaters . the tabloids found it a fine opportunity for hatching all sorts of hoaxes . in those newspapers short of copy , you saw the reappearance of every gigantic imaginary creature , from "" moby dick , "" that dreadful white whale from the high arctic regions , to the stupendous kraken whose tentacles could entwine a 500-ton craft and drag it into the ocean depths . they even reprinted reports from ancient times : the views of aristotle and pliny accepting the existence of such monsters , then the norwegian stories of bishop pontoppidan , the narratives of paul egede , and finally the reports of captain harrington-- whose good faith is above suspicion -- in which he claims he saw , while aboard the castilian in 1857 , one of those enormous serpents that , until then , had frequented only the seas of france 's old extremist newspaper , the constitutionalist .",3
"the city carpenters had erected scaffolds upon which the invited ladies were to be placed ; the city grocer had ornamented the chambers with two hundred flambeaux of white wax , a piece of luxury unheard of at that period ; and twenty violins were ordered , and the price for them fixed at double the usual rate , upon condition , said the report , that they should be played all night .",17

"oh , why was i so short of time ! i would have gone down the steep slopes of this mountain , crossed this entire immense continent , which surely connects africa with america , and visited its great prehistoric cities . under my eyes there perhaps lay the warlike town of makhimos or the pious village of eusebes , whose gigantic inhabitants lived for whole centuries and had the strength to raise blocks of stone that still withstood the action of the waters . one day perhaps , some volcanic phenomenon will bring these sunken ruins back to the surface of the waves ! numerous underwater volcanoes have been sighted in this part of the ocean , and many ships have felt terrific tremors when passing over these turbulent depths . a few have heard hollow noises that announced some struggle of the elements far below , others have hauled in volcanic ash hurled above the waves . as far as the equator this whole seafloor is still under construction by plutonic forces . and in some remote epoch , built up by volcanic disgorgings and successive layers of lava , who knows whether the peaks of these fire - belching mountains may reappear above the surface of the atlantic !",40

"and he was right . imagine the large development attained by these plants , which prefer a warm , moist climate . i knew that the _ lycopodon giganteum _ attains , according to bulliard , a circumference of eight or nine feet ; but here were pale mushrooms , thirty to forty feet high , and crowned with a cap of equal diameter . there they stood in thousands . no light could penetrate between their huge cones , and complete darkness reigned beneath those giants ; they formed settlements of domes placed in close array like the round , thatched roofs of a central african city .",107
""" i liked bonbons too in those days , miss eyre , and i was _ croquant_--(overlook the barbarism)--_croquant _ chocolate comfits , and smoking alternately , watching meantime the equipages that rolled along the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera - house , when in an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of english horses , and distinctly seen in the brilliant city - night , i recognised the ' voiture ' i had given celine .",65
""" my dear boy , they have only been talking about it for six weeks , and the british public are really not equal to the mental strain of having more than one topic every three months . they have been very fortunate lately , however . they have had my own divorce - case and alan campbell 's suicide . now they have got the mysterious disappearance of an artist . scotland yard still insists that the man in the grey ulster who left for paris by the midnight train on the ninth of november was poor basil , and the french police declare that basil never arrived in paris at all . i suppose in about a fortnight we shall be told that he has been seen in san francisco . it is an odd thing , but every one who disappears is said to be seen at san francisco . it must be a delightful city , and possess all the attractions of the next world .

"on february 6 the nautilus cruised in sight of the city of aden , perched on a promontory connected to the continent by a narrow isthmus , a sort of inaccessible gibraltar whose fortifications the english rebuilt after capturing it in 1839 . i glimpsed the octagonal minarets of this town , which used to be one of the wealthiest , busiest commercial centers along this coast , as the arab historian idrisi tells it .",10

"after the earthquake , which had destroyed three - fourths of the city of lisbon , the sages of that country could think of no means more effectual to preserve the kingdom from utter ruin than to entertain the people with an auto - da - fe , it having been decided by the university of coimbra , that the burning of a few people alive by a slow fire , and with great ceremony , is an infallible preventive of earthquakes .",12

"it was a warm june morning , and the latter day saints were as busy as the bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem . in the fields and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry . down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavily - laden mules , all heading to the west , for the gold fever had broken out in california , and the overland route lay through the city of the elect . there , too , were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands , and trains of tired immigrants , men and horses equally weary of their interminable journey . through all this motley assemblage , threading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider , there galloped lucy ferrier , her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out behind her . she had a commission from her father in the city , and was dashing in as she had done many a time before , with all the fearlessness of youth , thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed . the travel - stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment , and even the unemotional indians , journeying in with their pelties , relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale - faced maiden .",166
"on the morning which followed his interview with the mormon prophet , john ferrier went in to salt lake city , and having found his acquaintance , who was bound for the nevada mountains , he entrusted him with his message to jefferson hope . in it he told the young man of the imminent danger which threatened them , and how necessary it was that he should return . having done thus he felt easier in his mind , and returned home with a lighter heart .",19

""" the moment for which i had waited so long had at last come . i had my enemies within my power . together they could protect each other , but singly they were at my mercy . i did not act , however , with undue precipitation . my plans were already formed . there is no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes him , and why retribution has come upon him . i had my plans arranged by which i should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out . it chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in the brixton road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage . it was claimed that same evening , and returned ; but in the interval i had taken a moulding of it , and had a duplicate constructed . by means of this i had access to at least one spot in this great city where i could rely upon being free from interruption . how to get drebber to that house was the difficult problem which i had now to solve .",189
"meanwhile i was carefully examining these unleashed breakers . they measured up to fifteen meters in height over a length of 150 to 175 meters , and the speed of their propagation ( half that of the wind ) was fifteen meters per second . their volume and power increased with the depth of the waters . i then understood the role played by these waves , which trap air in their flanks and release it in the depths of the sea where its oxygen brings life . their utmost pressure -- it has been calculated-- can build to 3,000 kilograms on every square foot of surface they strike . it was such waves in the hebrides that repositioned a stone block weighing 84,000 pounds . it was their relatives in the tidal wave on december 23 , 1854 , that toppled part of the japanese city of tokyo , then went that same day at 700 kilometers per hour to break on the beaches of america .",146
