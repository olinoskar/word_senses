"at eleven o'clock the rangoon rode out of singapore harbour , and in a few hours the high mountains of malacca , with their forests , inhabited by the most beautifully - furred tigers in the world , were lost to view . singapore is distant some thirteen hundred miles from the island of hong kong , which is a little english colony near the chinese coast . phileas fogg hoped to accomplish the journey in six days , so as to be in time for the steamer which would leave on the 6th of november for yokohama , the principal japanese port .",102
"this idea soon became so insupportable to her that at the risk of whatever terrible consequences might result to herself from it , she implored the captain to put her on shore ; but the captain , eager to escape from his false position -- placed between french and english cruisers , like the bat between the mice and the birds -- was in great haste to regain england , and positively refused to obey what he took for a woman ’s caprice , promising his passenger , who had been particularly recommended to him by the cardinal , to land her , if the sea and the french permitted him , at one of the ports of brittany , either at lorient or brest . but the wind was contrary , the sea bad ; they tacked and kept offshore .",116

"leaning against the walls , i dragged myself down the gangways to the lounge , whose ceiling lights were on . the furniture had been knocked over . fortunately the glass cases were solidly secured at the base and had stood fast . since we were no longer vertical , the starboard pictures were glued to the tapestries , while those to port had their lower edges hanging a foot away from the wall . so the nautilus was lying on its starboard side , completely stationary to boot .",62
"the hunters proceeded in the direction of port balloon , in order to reach the marsh , after having promised to be back by the evening .",7
"by then it was three o'clock in the afternoon . the current was slacking off , it was almost full tide . the nautilus drew near this island , which i can see to this day with its remarkable fringe of screw pines . we hugged it from less than two miles out . a sudden jolt threw me down . the nautilus had just struck a reef , and it remained motionless , listing slightly to port .",77

"all around had disappeared in the abyss ; the inferior cone of mount franklin , rent asunder by the explosion ; the lava jaws of shark gulf , the plateau of prospect heights , safety islet , the granite rocks of port balloon , the basalts of dakkar grotto , the long serpentine peninsula , so distant nevertheless from the center of the eruption .",41
""" certainly , "" said pencroft , "" a beast of burden would be very useful to us until the captain has made a steam cart , or even an engine , for some day we shall have a railroad from granite house to port balloon , with a branch line to mount franklin ! """,44
"in the meantime harness of vegetable fiber had been manufactured , and some days after the capture of the onagers , not only the cart was ready , but a straight road , or rather a cutting , had been made through the forests of the far west , from the angle of the mercy to port balloon .",56

"this work had been so quickly done , that pencroft , gideon spilett , and herbert found time to make an expedition to port balloon , the sailor was very anxious to know if the little creek in which the "" bonadventure "" was moored , had been visited by the convicts .",23
"pencroft 's apprehensions were not without foundation , and a visit to port balloon appeared to be very desirable .",12
"the moment the little troop passed goskal and were approaching the port , a man sheltered beneath a tree detached himself from the trunk with which he had been confounded in the darkness , and advanced into the middle of the road , putting his finger on his lips .",11
"arrived at port balloon , pencroft saw with extreme satisfaction that the "" bonadventure "" was tranquilly floating in the narrow creek .",2
""" in order to steer this boat to port or starboard , in short , to make turns on a horizontal plane , i use an ordinary , wide - bladed rudder that 's fastened to the rear of the sternpost and worked by a wheel and tackle . but i can also move the nautilus upward and downward on a vertical plane by the simple method of slanting its two fins , which are attached to its sides at its center of flotation ; these fins are flexible , able to assume any position , and can be operated from inside by means of powerful levers . if these fins stay parallel with the boat , the latter moves horizontally . if they slant , the nautilus follows the angle of that slant and , under its propeller 's thrust , either sinks on a diagonal as steep as it suits me , or rises on that diagonal . and similarly , if i want to return more swiftly to the surface , i throw the propeller in gear , and the water 's pressure makes the nautilus rise vertically , as an air balloon inflated with hydrogen lifts swiftly into the skies .

"the daily labors were pursued methodically , and , as well as improving the roads to the corral and to port balloon , a third was commenced , which , starting from the enclosure , proceeded towards the western coast .",20
"it was evident that the vessel had been moved , more or less , since pencroft had brought her to port balloon .",20

"i had three encouragements—1st , a smooth , calm sea ; 2ndly , the tide rising , and setting in to the shore ; 3rdly , what little wind there was blew me towards the land . and thus , having found two or three broken oars belonging to the boat — and , besides the tools which were in the chest , i found two saws , an axe , and a hammer ; with this cargo i put to sea . for a mile or thereabouts my raft went very well , only that i found it drive a little distant from the place where i had landed before ; by which i perceived that there was some indraft of the water , and consequently i hoped to find some creek or river there , which i might make use of as a port to get to land with my cargo .",145
"we were traveling due west and on january 11 we doubled cape wessel , located in longitude 135 degrees and latitude 10 degrees north , the western tip of the gulf of carpentaria . reefs were still numerous but more widely scattered and were fixed on the chart with the greatest accuracy . the nautilus easily avoided the money breakers to port and the victoria reefs to starboard , positioned at longitude 130 degrees on the tenth parallel , which we went along rigorously .",61

"lord glenarvan then told him , that at the first port they put into , he would be delivered up to the english authorities .",10
"but by continuing in this direction she must soon disappear behind claw cape , as the wind was from the southwest , and to watch her it would be then necessary to ascend the height of washington bay , near port balloon -- a provoking circumstance , for it was already five o'clock in the evening , and the twilight would soon make any observation extremely difficult .",40
"it was therefore decided that neb and pencroft should go to port balloon , and that there , at nightfall , they should light an immense fire , the blaze of which would necessarily attract the attention of the brig .",11

"during that day a fearsome school of sharks provided us with an escort . dreadful animals that teem in these seas and make them extremely dangerous . there were port jackson sharks with a brown back , a whitish belly , and eleven rows of teeth , bigeye sharks with necks marked by a large black spot encircled in white and resembling an eye , and isabella sharks whose rounded snouts were strewn with dark speckles . often these powerful animals rushed at the lounge window with a violence less than comforting . by this point ned land had lost all self - control . he wanted to rise to the surface of the waves and harpoon the monsters , especially certain smooth - hound sharks whose mouths were paved with teeth arranged like a mosaic , and some big five - meter tiger sharks that insisted on personally provoking him . but the nautilus soon picked up speed and easily left astern the fastest of these man - eaters .",29
