"breathing that sea breeze , so much more invigorating and balsamic as the land is approached , contemplating all the power of those preparations she was commissioned to destroy , all the power of that army which she was to combat alone -- she , a woman with a few bags of gold -- milady compared herself mentally to judith , the terrible jewess , when she penetrated the camp of the assyrians and beheld the enormous mass of chariots , horses , men , and arms , which a gesture of her hand was to dissipate like a cloud of smoke .",77,"('mass', 'masse', 'masa')",1
"in essence , on july 20 , 1866 , the steamer governor higginson , from the calcutta & burnach steam navigation co. , encountered this moving mass five miles off the eastern shores of australia . captain baker at first thought he was in the presence of an unknown reef ; he was even about to fix its exact position when two waterspouts shot out of this inexplicable object and sprang hissing into the air some 150 feet . so , unless this reef was subject to the intermittent eruptions of a geyser , the governor higginson had fair and honest dealings with some aquatic mammal , until then unknown , that could spurt from its blowholes waterspouts mixed with air and steam .",26,"('mass', 'masse', 'masa')",1

"suddenly i let out a yell . there had been a collision , but it was comparatively mild . i could feel the penetrating force of the steel spur . i could hear scratchings and scrapings . carried away with its driving power , the nautilus had passed through the vessel 's mass like a sailmaker 's needle through canvas !",52,"('mass', 'masse', 'masa')",1
"an enormous mass was sinking beneath the waters , and the nautilus , missing none of its death throes , was descending into the depths with it . ten meters away , i could see its gaping hull , into which water was rushing with a sound of thunder , then its double rows of cannons and railings . its deck was covered with dark , quivering shadows .",2,"('mass', 'masse', 'masa')",1

"two hours after leaving the nautilus , we had cleared the timberline , and 100 feet above our heads stood the mountain peak , forming a dark silhouette against the brilliant glare that came from its far slope . petrified shrubs rambled here and there in sprawling zigzags . fish rose in a body at our feet like birds startled in tall grass . the rocky mass was gouged with impenetrable crevices , deep caves , unfathomable holes at whose far ends i could hear fearsome things moving around . my blood would curdle as i watched some enormous antenna bar my path , or saw some frightful pincer snap shut in the shadow of some cavity ! a thousand specks of light glittered in the midst of the gloom . they were the eyes of gigantic crustaceans crouching in their lairs , giant lobsters rearing up like spear carriers and moving their claws with a scrap - iron clanking , titanic crabs aiming their bodies like cannons on their carriages , and hideous devilfish intertwining their tentacles like bushes of writhing snakes .",66,"('mass', 'masse', 'masa')",1
"this tree is distinguished from other trees by a straight trunk forty feet high . to the naturalist 's eye , its gracefully rounded crown , formed of big multilobed leaves , was enough to denote the artocarpus that has been so successfully transplanted to the mascarene islands east of madagascar . from its mass of greenery , huge globular fruit stood out , a decimeter wide and furnished on the outside with creases that assumed a hexangular pattern . it 's a handy plant that nature gives to regions lacking in wheat ; without needing to be cultivated , it bears fruit eight months out of the year .",54,"('mass', 'masse', 'masa')",1
