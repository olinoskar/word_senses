"yet i decided to return to the nautilus . we went along a steep , narrow path that ran over the cliff 's summit . by 11:30 we had arrived at our landing place . the beached skiff had brought the captain ashore . i spotted him standing on a chunk of basalt . his instruments were beside him . his eyes were focused on the northern horizon , along which the sun was sweeping in its extended arc .",2
"but his habit of silence gained upon him day by day , and was infecting us . external objects produce decided effects upon the brain . a man shut up between four walls soon loses the power to associate words and ideas together . how many prisoners in solitary confinement become idiots , if not mad , for want of exercise for the thinking faculty !",20
"pretty perplexed , dumont d'urville did n't know if he should give credence to these reports , which had been carried in some of the less reliable newspapers ; nevertheless , he decided to start on dillon 's trail .",32
fix now decided to make a bold move ; he resolved to tell passepartout all . it seemed to be the only possible means of keeping phileas fogg several days longer at hong kong .,2
"the colonists were driven to their last entrenchment , and although the upper seams of the vessel were not yet calked , they decided to launch her at once .",23
""" well , of course , that is possible also . i am very much indebted to you , dr . mortimer , for introducing me to a problem which presents several interesting alternatives . but the practical point which we now have to decide , sir henry , is whether it is or is not advisable for you to go to baskerville hall .

it was a chamber whose furniture was at once appropriate for a prisoner or a free man ; and yet bars at the windows and outside bolts at the door decided the question in favor of the prison .,30
"when i consulted the chart an hour later , i saw that the nautilus 's position was marked at longitude 16 degrees 17 ' and latitude 33 degrees 22 ' , a good 150 leagues from the nearest coast . it would n't do to even dream of escaping , and i 'll let the reader decide how promptly the canadian threw a tantrum when i ventured to tell him our situation .",56

""" hum ! "" observed the reporter , who had not given any decided opinion .",13
"as for the crew , they only wanted to encounter the unicorn , harpoon it , haul it on board , and carve it up . they surveyed the sea with scrupulous care . besides , commander farragut had mentioned that a certain sum of $ 2,000.00 was waiting for the man who first sighted the animal , be he cabin boy or sailor , mate or officer . i 'll let the reader decide whether eyes got proper exercise aboard the abraham lincoln .",74

"whitcross regained , i followed a road which led from the sun , now fervent and high . by no other circumstance had i will to decide my choice .",26
"however , the chief business of the colonists was to make that complete exploration of the island which had been decided upon , and which would have two objects : to discover the mysterious being whose existence was now indisputable , and at the same time to find out what had become of the pirates , what retreat they had chosen , what sort of life they were leading , and what was to be feared from them .",20
"matters being thus decided , the building of a vessel large enough to sail either to the archipelagoes in the north , or to new zealand in the west , was no longer talked of , and they busied themselves in their accustomed occupations , with a view to wintering a third time in granite house .",3
"cyrus harding informed ayrton of the projected expedition , and proposed that he should take part in it , but ayrton preferring to remain on shore , it was decided that he should come to granite house during the absence of his companions .",29

"before more carefully examining the interior features of this enormous cavern , and before deciding if it was the work of nature or humankind , i went over to captain nemo .",14
"nothing else until the moment when , through a rift in the clouds , i saw the daring captain clinging to one of the animal 's fins , fighting the monster at close quarters , belaboring his enemy 's belly with stabs of the dagger yet unable to deliver the deciding thrust , in other words , a direct hit to the heart . in its struggles the man - eater churned the watery mass so furiously , its eddies threatened to knock me over .",50
"the next day , january 6 : nothing new on board . not a sound inside , not a sign of life . the skiff stayed alongside in the same place we had left it . we decided to return to gueboroa island . ned land hoped for better luck in his hunting than on the day before , and he wanted to visit a different part of the forest .",37

"that day , the sixth of our imprisonment , captain nemo concluded that picks and mattocks were too slow to deal with the ice layer still separating us from open water -- and he decided to crush this layer . the man had kept his energy and composure . he had subdued physical pain with moral strength . he could still think , plan , and act .",34

"after his first depression , passepartout became calmer , and began to study his situation . it was certainly not an enviable one . he found himself on the way to japan , and what should he do when he got there ? his pocket was empty ; he had not a solitary shilling , not so much as a penny . his passage had fortunately been paid for in advance ; and he had five or six days in which to decide upon his future course . he fell to at meals with an appetite , and ate for mr . fogg , aouda , and himself . he helped himself as generously as if japan were a desert , where nothing to eat was to be looked for .",82
