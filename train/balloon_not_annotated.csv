"with the winter , work had been resumed in the interior of granite house , mending clothes and different occupations , among others making the sails for their vessel , which were cut from the inexhaustible balloon - case .",36
the delicate sensibility of balloons is well known .,4
"the bridge would render easy the transport of the balloon case , which would furnish them with linen , and the inhabitants of the enclosure would yield wool which would supply them with winter clothes .",9
might not the balloon before that be emptied of all the fluid it yet retained ?,3
"the balloon - case bulged out again , and the wind , taking it , drove it along like a vessel .",1
"the missing person had evidently been swept off by the sea , which had just struck the net , and it was owing to this circumstance that the lightened balloon rose the last time , and then soon after reached the land .",29
a hundred times had they almost fallen from their torn balloon into the depths of the ocean .,10
"the settlers now began to talk of fetching the balloon - case , which they were anxious to place in perfect security ; but to bring it , it would be necessary to take a cart to port balloon , and consequently , necessary to beat a road through the dense forests of the far west .",9
"also , neb and pencroft having gone to examine into the state of things at port balloon , and reported that the stock of cloth would suffer no damage in the grotto where it was stored , it was decided that the work at prospect heights should not be discontinued .",16
"lastly , the time had come for turning the balloon - case to use , by cutting it up to make shirts and other articles ; for as to keeping it in its present form , and risking themselves in a balloon filled with gas , above a sea of the limits of which they had no idea , it was not to be thought of .",9
""" certainly , "" said pencroft , "" a beast of burden would be very useful to us until the captain has made a steam cart , or even an engine , for some day we shall have a railroad from granite house to port balloon , with a branch line to mount franklin ! """,45
"the cloth of which the balloon - case was made was then cleaned by means of soda and potash , obtained by the incineration of plants , in such a way that the cotton , having got rid of the varnish , resumed its natural softness and elasticity ; then , exposed to the action of the atmosphere , it soon became perfectly white .",5
""" in order to steer this boat to port or starboard , in short , to make turns on a horizontal plane , i use an ordinary , wide - bladed rudder that 's fastened to the rear of the sternpost and worked by a wheel and tackle . but i can also move the nautilus upward and downward on a vertical plane by the simple method of slanting its two fins , which are attached to its sides at its center of flotation ; these fins are flexible , able to assume any position , and can be operated from inside by means of powerful levers . if these fins stay parallel with the boat , the latter moves horizontally . if they slant , the nautilus follows the angle of that slant and , under its propeller 's thrust , either sinks on a diagonal as steep as it suits me , or rises on that diagonal . and similarly , if i want to return more swiftly to the surface , i throw the propeller in gear , and the water 's pressure makes the nautilus rise vertically , as an air balloon inflated with hydrogen lifts swiftly into the skies . """,195
our readers will recollect what befell these five daring individuals who set out on their hazardous expedition in the balloon on the 20th of march .,19
""" but if we had not thrown them away , pencroft , the balloon would have thrown us to the bottom of the sea ! "" said herbert .",13
"but it was necessary to bring down the remains of the balloon from the tree , to place it in security , and this was no slight task .",11
"neb , herbert , and the sailor , climbing to the summit of the tree , used all their skill to disengage the now reduced balloon .",25
