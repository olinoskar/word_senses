"when the nautilus returned to the surface of the ocean , i could take in reao island over its whole flat , wooded expanse . obviously its madreporic rocks had been made fertile by tornadoes and thunderstorms . one day , carried off by a hurricane from neighboring shores , some seed fell onto these limestone beds , mixing with decomposed particles of fish and marine plants to form vegetable humus . propelled by the waves , a coconut arrived on this new coast . its germ took root . its tree grew tall , catching steam off the water . a brook was born . little by little , vegetation spread . tiny animals -- worms , insects -- rode ashore on tree trunks snatched from islands to windward . turtles came to lay their eggs . birds nested in the young trees . in this way animal life developed , and drawn by the greenery and fertile soil , man appeared . and that 's how these islands were formed , the immense achievement of microscopic animals .",63,"('fish', 'poisson', 'pez')",0
"by december 15 we had left the alluring society islands in the west , likewise elegant tahiti , queen of the pacific . in the morning i spotted this island 's lofty summits a few miles to leeward . its waters supplied excellent fish for the tables on board : mackerel , bonito , albacore , and a few varieties of that sea serpent named the moray eel .",43,"('fish', 'poisson', 'pez')",0

"two hours after leaving the nautilus , we had cleared the timberline , and 100 feet above our heads stood the mountain peak , forming a dark silhouette against the brilliant glare that came from its far slope . petrified shrubs rambled here and there in sprawling zigzags . fish rose in a body at our feet like birds startled in tall grass . the rocky mass was gouged with impenetrable crevices , deep caves , unfathomable holes at whose far ends i could hear fearsome things moving around . my blood would curdle as i watched some enormous antenna bar my path , or saw some frightful pincer snap shut in the shadow of some cavity ! a thousand specks of light glittered in the midst of the gloom . they were the eyes of gigantic crustaceans crouching in their lairs , giant lobsters rearing up like spear carriers and moving their claws with a scrap - iron clanking , titanic crabs aiming their bodies like cannons on their carriages , and hideous devilfish intertwining their tentacles like bushes of writhing snakes .",49,"('fish', 'poisson', 'pez')",0
