""" what nonsense you talk , harry ! "" cried the lad , taking a light from a fire - breathing silver dragon that the waiter had placed on the table . "" let us go down to the theatre . when sibyl comes on the stage you will have a new ideal of life . she will represent something to you that you have never known . """,11
""" good lads ! "" the canadian muttered .",2
""" i am going to see the play through , "" answered the lad , in a hard bitter voice . "" i am awfully sorry that i have made you waste an evening , harry . i apologize to you both . """,13
""" do you mean about sibyl vane ? "" asked the lad .",11
"the lad was allowed to run on , and he delivered his little botanical lecture with great animation .",1
""" harry , harry , it is terrible ! "" cried the lad .",12
"the lad was thirty years old , and his age to that of his employer was as fifteen is to twenty . please forgive me for this underhanded way of admitting i had turned forty .",1
""" what is that , harry ? "" said the lad listlessly .",10
""" she will never come to life again now , "" muttered the lad , burying his face in his hands .",13
"a quarter of an hour later , our trunks were ready . conseil did them in a flash , and i was sure the lad had n't missed a thing , because he classified shirts and suits as expertly as birds and mammals .",24
"the lad flushed up and , going to the window , looked out for a few moments on the green , flickering , sun - lashed garden . "" i owe a great deal to harry , basil , "" he said at last , "" more than i owe to you . you only taught me to be vain . """,1
""" my dear fellow , you exaggerate . i have some recollection , wilson , that you had among your boys a lad named cartwright , who showed some ability during the investigation . """,22
""" i should like to come to the theatre with you , lord henry , "" said the lad .",18
"hallward was thunderstruck . he looked at dorian gray in absolute amazement . he had never seen him like this before . the lad was actually pallid with rage . his hands were clenched , and the pupils of his eyes were like disks of blue fire . he was trembling all over .",23
""" ay , ay ! "" said athos , exchanging a smile with dâ€™artagnan and aramis , "" it is very clear you acted nobly with regard to the poor lad ; that is like a good master . """,30
""" basil ! "" cried the lad , clutching the arms of his chair with trembling hands and gazing at him with wild startled eyes .",6
"the lad hesitated , and looked over at lord henry , who was watching them from the tea - table with an amused smile .",1
""" herbert , "" he asked of the lad , "" is not this the 15th of april ? """,8
"was this done on purpose ? or was it a mistake ? did he want to reduce us by famine ? this seemed like going rather too far ! what ! should martha and i be victims of a position of things in which we had not the smallest interest ? it was a fact that a few years before this , whilst my uncle was working at his great classification of minerals , he was forty - eight hours without eating , and all his household were obliged to share in this scientific fast . as for me , what i remember is , that i got severe cramps in my stomach , which hardly suited the constitution of a hungry , growing lad .",124
"yes ; it was an interesting background . it posed the lad , made him more perfect , as it were . behind every exquisite thing that existed , there was something tragic . worlds had to be in travail , that the meanest flower might blow . . . . and how charming he had been at dinner the night before , as with startled eyes and lips parted in frightened pleasure he had sat opposite to him at the club , the red candleshades staining to a richer rose the wakening wonder of his face . talking to him was like playing upon an exquisite violin . he answered to every touch and thrill of the bow . . . .",11
"he remembered something like it in history . was it not plato , that artist in thought , who had first analyzed it ? was it not buonarotti who had carved it in the coloured marbles of a sonnet - sequence ? but in our own century it was strange . . . . yes ; he would try to be to dorian gray what , without knowing it , the lad was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderful portrait . he would seek to dominate him -- had already , indeed , half done so . he would make that wonderful spirit his own . there was something fascinating in this son of love and death .",71
"it was a poisonous book . the heavy odour of incense seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain . the mere cadence of the sentences , the subtle monotony of their music , so full as it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately repeated , produced in the mind of the lad , as he passed from chapter to chapter , a form of reverie , a malady of dreaming , that made him unconscious of the falling day and creeping shadows .",56
thus the lad reasoned .,2
"when they opened the window , they saw the poor lad lying senseless , with his head split by a blow with a pitchfork .",10
"but what was still more inexplicable was , that top was neither tired , nor exhausted , nor even soiled with mud or sand!--herbert had drawn him towards him , and was patting his head , the dog rubbing his neck against the lad 's hands .",43
"from time to time herbert relieved him at the helm , and the lad 's hand was so firm that the sailor had not a point to find fault with .",13
the reporter listened to ascertain if the poor lad 's heart was still beating .,8
"the sailor trusted herbert as he would himself , and his confidence was justified by the coolness and judgment of the lad .",21
""" for medicine , "" replied the lad , "" to treat us when we are ill . """,7
"conseil had coolly reasoned out this hypothesis and laid his plans accordingly . an amazing character , this boy ; in midocean , this stoic lad seemed right at home !",25
"there cyrus harding listened to the lad 's account , shook his head and said nothing .",6
"his father had encouraged him in it , by letting him attend the lectures of the best professors in boston , who were very fond of the intelligent , industrious lad .",30
"as he left the room , lord henry 's heavy eyelids drooped , and he began to think . certainly few people had ever interested him so much as dorian gray , and yet the lad 's mad adoration of some one else caused him not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy . he was pleased by it . it made him a more interesting study . he had been always enthralled by the methods of natural science , but the ordinary subject - matter of that science had seemed to him trivial and of no import .",35
"mrs . vane glanced at her , and with one of those false theatrical gestures that so often become a mode of second nature to a stage - player , clasped her in her arms . at this moment , the door opened and a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room . he was thick - set of figure , and his hands and feet were large and somewhat clumsy in movement . he was not so finely bred as his sister . one would hardly have guessed the close relationship that existed between them . mrs . vane fixed her eyes on him and intensified her smile . she mentally elevated her son to the dignity of an audience . she felt sure that the tableau was interesting .",46
""" you might keep some of your kisses for me , sibyl , i think , "" said the lad with a good - natured grumble .",19
""" society ! "" muttered the lad . "" i do n't want to know anything about that . i should like to make some money to take you and sibyl off the stage . i hate it . """,6
""" you do n't know his name , though , "" said the lad harshly .",13
the lad muttered something to himself and drummed on the window - pane with his coarse fingers . he had just turned round to say something when the door opened and sibyl ran in .,1
"in a kind of little bay , created by a point of the shore which broke the current , the sailor and the lad placed some good - sized pieces of wood , which they had fastened together with dry creepers . a raft was thus formed , on which they stacked all they had collected , sufficient , indeed , to have loaded at least twenty men .",23
the lad listened sulkily to her and made no answer . he was heart - sick at leaving home .,1
"cunegund , not knowing that she was grown ugly , as no one had informed her of it , reminded candide of his promise in so peremptory a manner , that the simple lad did not dare to refuse her ; he then acquainted the baron that he was going to marry his sister .",33
"herbert , become again the healthy and vigorous lad he was before his illness , derived great benefit from this life in the open air , between the sea breezes and the vivifying air from the forests .",8
""" your friend conseil , "" the fine lad replied serenely , "" has nothing to say for himself . he 's a completely disinterested party on this question . like his master , like his comrade ned , he 's a bachelor . neither wife , parents , nor children are waiting for him back home . he 's in master 's employ , he thinks like master , he speaks like master , and much to his regret , he ca n't be counted on to form a majority . only two persons face each other here : master on one side , ned land on the other . that said , your friend conseil is listening , and he 's ready to keep score . """,8
""" why , you do n't even know his name , "" answered the lad . "" who is he ? i have a right to know . """,14
""" he is a gentleman , "" said the lad sullenly .",9
""" take this , "" said athos , with his usual careless generosity , giving him his own , "" and be a good lad .",24
"this short break was a delight . it lacked only the charm of conversation . but it was impossible to speak , impossible to reply . i simply nudged my big copper headpiece against conseil 's headpiece . i saw a happy gleam in the gallant lad 's eyes , and to communicate his pleasure , he jiggled around inside his carapace in the world 's silliest way .",46
"in sybil 's own room they parted . there was jealousy in the lad 's heart , and a fierce murderous hatred of the stranger who , as it seemed to him , had come between them . yet , when her arms were flung round his neck , and her fingers strayed through his hair , he softened and kissed her with real affection . there were tears in his eyes as he went downstairs .",13
""" my father was a scoundrel then ! "" cried the lad , clenching his fists .",11
""" extremely well , my gallant lad , "" i replied . "" and how about you , mr . ned land ? """,6
""" and i do n't forgive you for being late for dinner , "" broke in lord henry , putting his hand on the lad 's shoulder and smiling as he spoke . "" come , let us sit down and try what the new chef here is like , and then you will tell us how it all came about . """,24
""" none . the only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was rodger baskerville , the youngest of three brothers of whom poor sir charles was the elder . the second brother , who died young , is the father of this lad henry . the third , rodger , was the black sheep of the family . he came of the old masterful baskerville strain , and was the very image , they tell me , of the family picture of old hugo . he made england too hot to hold him , fled to central america , and died there in 1876 of yellow fever . henry is the last of the baskervilles . in one hour and five minutes i meet him at waterloo station . i have had a wire that he arrived at southampton this morning . now , mr . holmes , what would you advise me to do with him ? """,45
"cyrus harding , gideon spilett , and pencroft had become very skilful in dressing the lad 's wounds .",15
"the engineer 's orders were obeyed , and while the reporter and the lad , the best marksmen in the colony , posted themselves in a good position , but out of the monkeys ' sight , neb , pencroft , and cyrus climbed the plateau and entered the forest in order to kill some game , for it was now time for breakfast and they had no provisions remaining .",13
"as for me , i was no longer content with the hypotheses that satisfied conseil . that fine lad persisted in seeing the nautilus 's commander as merely one of those unappreciated scientists who repay humanity 's indifference with contempt . for conseil , the captain was still a misunderstood genius who , tired of the world 's deceptions , had been driven to take refuge in this inaccessible environment where he was free to follow his instincts . but to my mind , this hypothesis explained only one side of captain nemo .",18
""" my dear lad , that was yesterday , when i was telling you silly stories , it was proper to tell me that , and not this morning .",3
"harding could not help smiling on hearing the lad 's reflection , which showed a thoughtful mind .",8
"anyone consulting conseil would soon learn from the gallant lad that the branch mollusca is divided into five classes ; that the first class features the cephalopoda ( whose members are sometimes naked , sometimes covered with a shell ) , which consists of two families , the dibranchiata and the tetrabranchiata , which are distinguished by their number of gills ; that the family dibranchiata includes three genera , the argonaut , the squid , and the cuttlefish , and that the family tetrabranchiata contains only one genus , the nautilus . after this catalog , if some recalcitrant listener confuses the argonaut , which is acetabuliferous ( in other words , a bearer of suction tubes ) , with the nautilus , which is tentaculiferous ( a bearer of tentacles ) , it will be simply unforgivable .",9
"dim and wavering as was the wind - blown light , yet it served to show him the hideous error , as it seemed , into which he had fallen , for the face of the man he had sought to kill had all the bloom of boyhood , all the unstained purity of youth . he seemed little more than a lad of twenty summers , hardly older , if older indeed at all , than his sister had been when they had parted so many years ago . it was obvious that this was not the man who had destroyed her life .",62
