"the captain 's fingers then ran over the instrument 's keyboard , and i noticed that he touched only its black keys , which gave his melodies a basically scottish color . soon he had forgotten my presence and was lost in a reverie that i no longer tried to dispel .",21
"as to the key , it had disappeared . at the hour appointed , lord de winter and the four friends repaired to the convent ; the bells tolled , the chapel was open , the grating of the choir was closed .",3
"it was close upon nine when he set out . i had no idea how long he might be , but i sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages of henri murger 's "" vie de boh√®me . "" ten o'clock passed , and i heard the footsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed . eleven , and the more stately tread of the landlady passed my door , bound for the same destination . it was close upon twelve before i heard the sharp sound of his latch - key . the instant he entered i saw by his face that he had not been successful . amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the mastery , until the former suddenly carried the day , and he burst into a hearty laugh .",97

"suddenly she came upon a little three - legged table , all made of solid glass ; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key , and alice 's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall ; but , alas ! either the locks were too large , or the key was too small , but at any rate it would not open any of them . however , on the second time round , she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before , and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high : she tried the little golden key in the lock , and to her great delight it fitted !",114
"alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage , not much larger than a rat - hole : she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw . how she longed to get out of that dark hall , and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains , but she could not even get her head though the doorway ; ' and even if my head would go through , ' thought poor alice , ' it would be of very little use without my shoulders . oh , how i wish i could shut up like a telescope ! i think i could , if i only know how to begin . ' for , you see , so many out - of - the - way things had happened lately , that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible . there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door , so she went back to the table , half hoping she might find another key on it , or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes : this time she found a little bottle on it , ( ' which certainly was not here before , ' said alice , ) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label , with the words ' drink me ' beautifully printed on it in large letters .",191
"after a while , finding that nothing more happened , she decided on going into the garden at once ; but , alas for poor alice ! when she got to the door , she found she had forgotten the little golden key , and when she went back to the table for it , she found she could not possibly reach it : she could see it quite plainly through the glass , and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table , but it was too slippery ; and when she had tired herself out with trying , the poor little thing sat down and cried .",42
"just then her head struck against the roof of the hall : in fact she was now more than nine feet high , and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door .",32
"i followed with my eyes his trembling hands , i took count of every movement . might not some unhoped - for result come of it ? i trembled , too , very unnecessarily , since the true key was in my hands , and no other would open the secret .",38
"part of the night passed without incident . we kept watch for an opportunity to take action . we talked little , being too keyed up . ned land was all for jumping overboard . i forced him to wait . as i saw it , the nautilus would attack the double - decker on the surface of the waves , and then it would be not only possible but easy to escape .",24

""" the moment for which i had waited so long had at last come . i had my enemies within my power . together they could protect each other , but singly they were at my mercy . i did not act , however , with undue precipitation . my plans were already formed . there is no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes him , and why retribution has come upon him . i had my plans arranged by which i should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out . it chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in the brixton road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage . it was claimed that same evening , and returned ; but in the interval i had taken a moulding of it , and had a duplicate constructed . by means of this i had access to at least one spot in this great city where i could rely upon being free from interruption . how to get drebber to that house was the difficult problem which i had now to solve .",137

"barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against the glass . his profile was half turned towards me , and his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the moor . for some minutes he stood watching intently . then he gave a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light . instantly i made my way back to my room , and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing once more upon their return journey . long afterwards when i had fallen into a light sleep i heard a key turn somewhere in a lock , but i could not tell whence the sound came . what it all means i can not guess , but there is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of . i do not trouble you with my theories , for you asked me to furnish you only with facts . i have had a long talk with sir henry this morning , and we have made a plan of campaign founded upon my observations of last night . i will not speak about it just now , but it should make my next report interesting reading .",105

"once more she found herself in the long hall , and close to the little glass table .
