"was phileas fogg rich ? undoubtedly . but those who knew him best could not imagine how he had made his fortune , and mr . fogg was the last person to whom to apply for the information . he was not lavish , nor , on the contrary , avaricious ; for , whenever he knew that money was needed for a noble , useful , or benevolent purpose , he supplied it quietly and sometimes anonymously . he was , in short , the least communicative of men . he talked very little , and seemed all the more mysterious for his taciturn manner . his daily habits were quite open to observation ; but whatever he did was so exactly the same thing that he had always done before , that the wits of the curious were fairly puzzled .",3

"a sandy beach unfolded before us , measuring 500 feet at its widest point between the waters of the lake and the foot of the mountain 's walls . via this strand you could easily circle the lake . but the base of these high walls consisted of broken soil over which there lay picturesque piles of volcanic blocks and enormous pumice stones . all these crumbling masses were covered with an enamel polished by the action of underground fires , and they glistened under the stream of electric light from our beacon . stirred up by our footsteps , the mica - rich dust on this beach flew into the air like a cloud of sparks .",103

"the effect of these replies upon the already suspicious and excited detective may be imagined . the hasty departure from london soon after the robbery ; the large sum carried by mr . fogg ; his eagerness to reach distant countries ; the pretext of an eccentric and foolhardy bet -- all confirmed fix in his theory . he continued to pump poor passepartout , and learned that he really knew little or nothing of his master , who lived a solitary existence in london , was said to be rich , though no one knew whence came his riches , and was mysterious and impenetrable in his affairs and habits . fix felt sure that phileas fogg would not land at suez , but was really going on to bombay .",99
"yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many his strange and dangerous charm . his great wealth was a certain element of security . society -- civilized society , at least-- is never very ready to believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and fascinating . it feels instinctively that manners are of more importance than morals , and , in its opinion , the highest respectability is of much less value than the possession of a good chef . and , after all , it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has given one a bad dinner , or poor wine , is irreproachable in his private life . even the cardinal virtues can not atone for half - cold entrées , as lord henry remarked once , in a discussion on the subject , and there is possibly a good deal to be said for his view . for the canons of good society are , or should be , the same as the canons of art . form is absolutely essential to it . it should have the dignity of a ceremony , as well as its unreality , and should combine the insincere character of a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us . is insincerity such a terrible thing ? i think not . it is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities .",49
