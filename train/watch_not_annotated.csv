"the next day bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her little sister . of late i had often recalled this saying and this incident ; for during the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not brought with it a dream of an infant , which i sometimes hushed in my arms , sometimes dandled on my knee , sometimes watched playing with daisies on a lawn , or again , dabbling its hands in running water .",68
"hallward amused himself with watching the faces in the pit . the heat was terribly oppressive , and the huge sunlight flamed like a monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire . the youths in the gallery had taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them over the side . they talked to each other across the theatre and shared their oranges with the tawdry girls who sat beside them . some women were laughing in the pit . their voices were horribly shrill and discordant . the sound of the popping of corks came from the bar .",4

"phileas fogg was seated squarely in his armchair , his feet close together like those of a grenadier on parade , his hands resting on his knees , his body straight , his head erect ; he was steadily watching a complicated clock which indicated the hours , the minutes , the seconds , the days , the months , and the years . at exactly half - past eleven mr . fogg would , according to his daily habit , quit saville row , and repair to the reform .",39
dorian gray grew pale as he watched her . he was puzzled and anxious . neither of his friends dared to say anything to him . she seemed to them to be absolutely incompetent . they were horribly disappointed .,6

"as the dawn was just breaking , he found himself close to covent garden . the darkness lifted , and , flushed with faint fires , the sky hollowed itself into a perfect pearl . huge carts filled with nodding lilies rumbled slowly down the polished empty street . the air was heavy with the perfume of the flowers , and their beauty seemed to bring him an anodyne for his pain . he followed into the market and watched the men unloading their waggons . a white - smocked carter offered him some cherries . he thanked him , wondered why he refused to accept any money for them , and began to eat them listlessly . they had been plucked at midnight , and the coldness of the moon had entered into them .",79
"next day , the 28th of march , when the engineer awoke , about eight in the morning , he saw his companions around him watching his sleep , and , as on the day before , his first words were:--",25
"ayrton -- bound , gagged , and closely watched -- lived in this cave for four months .",8
"yet it was watching him , with its beautiful marred face and its cruel smile . its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight . its blue eyes met his own . a sense of infinite pity , not for himself , but for the painted image of himself , came over him . it had altered already , and would alter more . its gold would wither into grey . its red and white roses would die . for every sin that he committed , a stain would fleck and wreck its fairness . but he would not sin . the picture , changed or unchanged , would be to him the visible emblem of conscience . he would resist temptation . he would not see lord henry any more -- would not , at any rate , listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in basil hallward 's garden had first stirred within him the passion for impossible things . he would go back to sibyl vane , make her amends , marry her , try to love her again . yes , it was his duty to do so . she must have suffered more than he had . poor child ! he had been selfish and cruel to her . the fascination that she had exercised over him would return . they would be happy together . his life with her would be beautiful and pure .",3
"part of the night passed without incident . we kept watch for an opportunity to take action . we talked little , being too keyed up . ned land was all for jumping overboard . i forced him to wait . as i saw it , the nautilus would attack the double - decker on the surface of the waves , and then it would be not only possible but easy to escape .",10

"with his subtle smile , lord henry watched him . he knew the precise psychological moment when to say nothing . he felt intensely interested . he was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had produced , and , remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen , a book which had revealed to him much that he had not known before , he wondered whether dorian gray was passing through a similar experience . he had merely shot an arrow into the air . had it hit the mark ? how fascinating the lad was !",7
"the enormous vessel settled slowly . following it down , the nautilus kept watch on its every movement . suddenly there was an eruption . the air compressed inside the craft sent its decks flying , as if the powder stores had been ignited . the thrust of the waters was so great , the nautilus swerved away .",13
"i listened , i watched in the darkness for an answer , a cry , a mere breath of sound , but nothing came . some minutes passed . a whole world of ideas had opened in my mind . i thought that my weakened voice could never penetrate to my companions .",4

"we were both swift runners and in fairly good training , but we soon found that we had no chance of overtaking him . we saw him for a long time in the moonlight until he was only a small speck moving swiftly among the boulders upon the side of a distant hill . we ran and ran until we were completely blown , but the space between us grew ever wider . finally we stopped and sat panting on two rocks , while we watched him disappearing in the distance .",85

it was a moment of intense excitement . the professor was watching the hand of the chronometer .,11
"for there would be a real pleasure in watching it . he would be able to follow his mind into its secret places . this portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors . as it had revealed to him his own body , so it would reveal to him his own soul . and when winter came upon it , he would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of summer . when the blood crept from its face , and left behind a pallid mask of chalk with leaden eyes , he would keep the glamour of boyhood . not one blossom of his loveliness would ever fade . not one pulse of his life would ever weaken . like the gods of the greeks , he would be strong , and fleet , and joyous . what did it matter what happened to the coloured image on the canvas ? he would be safe . that was everything .",8

"two hours after leaving the nautilus , we had cleared the timberline , and 100 feet above our heads stood the mountain peak , forming a dark silhouette against the brilliant glare that came from its far slope . petrified shrubs rambled here and there in sprawling zigzags . fish rose in a body at our feet like birds startled in tall grass . the rocky mass was gouged with impenetrable crevices , deep caves , unfathomable holes at whose far ends i could hear fearsome things moving around . my blood would curdle as i watched some enormous antenna bar my path , or saw some frightful pincer snap shut in the shadow of some cavity ! a thousand specks of light glittered in the midst of the gloom . they were the eyes of gigantic crustaceans crouching in their lairs , giant lobsters rearing up like spear carriers and moving their claws with a scrap - iron clanking , titanic crabs aiming their bodies like cannons on their carriages , and hideous devilfish intertwining their tentacles like bushes of writhing snakes .",96
"dorian watched them as they plunged into the alder - clump , brushing the lithe swinging branches aside . in a few moments they emerged , dragging a body after them into the sunlight . he turned away in horror . it seemed to him that misfortune followed wherever he went . he heard sir geoffrey ask if the man was really dead , and the affirmative answer of the keeper . the wood seemed to him to have become suddenly alive with faces . there was the trampling of myriad feet and the low buzz of voices . a great copper- breasted pheasant came beating through the boughs overhead .",1

"but we could n't stop . we had to follow the captain , who headed down trails seemingly known only to himself . the seafloor rose noticeably , and when i lifted my arms , sometimes they would pass above the surface of the sea . then the level of the oysterbank would lower unpredictably . often we went around tall , pointed rocks rising like pyramids . in their dark crevices huge crustaceans , aiming their long legs like heavy artillery , watched us with unblinking eyes , while underfoot there crept millipedes , bloodworms , aricia worms , and annelid worms , whose antennas and tubular tentacles were incredibly long .",83
