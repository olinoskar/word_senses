"his head , supported by a long and flexible neck , issued from his large black robe , balancing itself with a motion very much like that of the tortoise thrusting his head out of his shell .",3
i was sensible that i could look for no support from a man disappointed in his hopes of an inheritance .,9
"i laid my hand on the back of a chair for support : i shook , i feared -- but i resolved .",11
"although milady would very willingly have gone without sleep , sustained as she was by all the excitements which a new adventure awakened in her heart , ever thirsting for intrigues , she nevertheless accepted the offer of the superior . during the last fifteen days she had experienced so many and such various emotions that if her frame of iron was still capable of supporting fatigue , her mind required repose .",65
his companions supported him .,2
"presently advanced into view miss ingram . she , too , was attired in oriental fashion : a crimson scarf tied sash - like round the waist : an embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples ; her beautifully - moulded arms bare , one of them upraised in the act of supporting a pitcher , poised gracefully on her head .",51
""" can the cannon support the shock of the pyroxyle ? "" asked the reporter , who was not less anxious than pencroft to try the artillery of granite house .",4
"mm bassompierre and schomberg were marshals of france , and claimed their right of commanding the army under the orders of the king ; but the cardinal , who feared that bassompierre , a huguenot at heart , might press but feebly the english and rochellais , his brothers in religion , supported the duc d’angouleme , whom the king , at his instigation , had named lieutenant general .",52

"in fact , four men such as they were -- four men devoted to one another , from their purses to their lives ; four men always supporting one another , never yielding , executing singly or together the resolutions formed in common ; four arms threatening the four cardinal points , or turning toward a single point -- must inevitably , either subterraneously , in open day , by mining , in the trench , by cunning , or by force , open themselves a way toward the object they wished to attain , however well it might be defended , or however distant it may seem .",27
"what could be the meaning of such a change ? up to this time facts had supported the theories of davy and of liedenbrock ; until now particular conditions of non - conducting rocks , electricity and magnetism , had tempered the laws of nature , giving us only a moderately warm climate , for the theory of a central fire remained in my estimation the only one that was true and explicable . were we then turning back to where the phenomena of central heat ruled in all their rigour and would reduce the most refractory rocks to the state of a molten liquid ? i feared this , and said to the professor :",16
"captain nemo went in . we followed him . my eyes soon grew accustomed to this comparative gloom . i distinguished the unpredictably contoured springings of a vault , supported by natural pillars firmly based on a granite foundation , like the weighty columns of tuscan architecture . why had our incomprehensible guide taken us into the depths of this underwater crypt ? i would soon find out .",29

"this man was armand jean duplessis , cardinal de richelieu ; not such as he is now represented -- broken down like an old man , suffering like a martyr , his body bent , his voice failing , buried in a large armchair as in an anticipated tomb ; no longer living but by the strength of his genius , and no longer maintaining the struggle with europe but by the eternal application of his thoughts -- but such as he really was at this period ; that is to say , an active and gallant cavalier , already weak of body , but sustained by that moral power which made of him one of the most extraordinary men that ever lived , preparing , after having supported the duc de nevers in his duchy of mantua , after having taken nimes , castres , and uzes , to drive the english from the isle of re and lay siege to la rochelle .",128
"at an elevation of about thirty meters , the nature of the terrain changed without becoming any easier . pudding stones and trachyte gave way to black basaltic rock : here , lying in slabs all swollen with blisters ; there , shaped like actual prisms and arranged into a series of columns that supported the springings of this immense vault , a wonderful sample of natural architecture . then , among this basaltic rock , there snaked long , hardened lava flows inlaid with veins of bituminous coal and in places covered by wide carpets of sulfur . the sunshine coming through the crater had grown stronger , shedding a hazy light over all the volcanic waste forever buried in the heart of this extinct mountain .",54

"looking down on this very scene , there stood upon the fourth of may , eighteen hundred and forty - seven , a solitary traveller . his appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region . an observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty . his face was lean and haggard , and the brown parchment - like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones ; his long , brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white ; his eyes were sunken in his head , and burned with an unnatural lustre ; while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton . as he stood , he leaned upon his weapon for support , and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution . his gaunt face , however , and his clothes , which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs , proclaimed what it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance . the man was dying — dying from hunger and from thirst .",142

""" seven to five ! "" repeated the other , and the two figures flitted away in different directions . their concluding words had evidently been some form of sign and countersign . the instant that their footsteps had died away in the distance , jefferson hope sprang to his feet , and helping his companions through the gap , led the way across the fields at the top of his speed , supporting and half - carrying the girl when her strength appeared to fail her .",73

"many citizens , seeing the women flying toward the high street , leaving their children crying at the open doors , hastened to don the cuirass , and supporting their somewhat uncertain courage with a musket or a partisan , directed their steps toward the hostelry of the jolly miller , before which was gathered , increasing every minute , a compact group , vociferous and full of curiosity .",28
