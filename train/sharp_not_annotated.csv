"in that place the fiord was at least three english miles wide ; the waves rolled with a rushing din upon the sharp - pointed rocks ; this inlet was confined between walls of rock , precipices crowned by sharp peaks 2,000 feet high , and remarkable for the brown strata which separated the beds of reddish tuff . however much i might respect the intelligence of our quadrupeds , i hardly cared to put it to the test by trusting myself to it on horseback across an arm of the sea .",22

"by nine o'clock we had pulled up to shore . the sky was growing brighter . clouds were fleeing to the south . mists were rising from the cold surface of the water . captain nemo headed toward the peak , which he no doubt planned to make his observatory . it was an arduous climb over sharp lava and pumice stones in the midst of air often reeking with sulfurous fumes from the smoke holes . for a man out of practice at treading land , the captain scaled the steepest slopes with a supple agility i could n't equal , and which would have been envied by hunters of pyrenees mountain goats .",57
"the thermometer marked -12 degrees centigrade , and a fresh breeze left a sharp nip in the air . ice floes were increasing over the open water . the sea was starting to congeal everywhere . numerous blackish patches were spreading over its surface , announcing the imminent formation of fresh ice . obviously this southernmost basin froze over during its six - month winter and became utterly inaccessible . what happened to the whales during this period ? no doubt they went beneath the ice bank to find more feasible seas . as for seals and walruses , they were accustomed to living in the harshest climates and stayed on in these icy waterways . these animals know by instinct how to gouge holes in the ice fields and keep them continually open ; they go to these holes to breathe . once the birds have migrated northward to escape the cold , these marine mammals remain as sole lords of the polar continent .",13

"this was where the nautilus had been sent accidentally-- or perhaps deliberately -- by its captain . it was sweeping around in a spiral whose radius kept growing smaller and smaller . the skiff , still attached to the ship 's plating , was likewise carried around at dizzying speed . i could feel us whirling . i was experiencing that accompanying nausea that follows such continuous spinning motions . we were in dread , in the last stages of sheer horror , our blood frozen in our veins , our nerves numb , drenched in cold sweat as if from the throes of dying ! and what a noise around our frail skiff ! what roars echoing from several miles away ! what crashes from the waters breaking against sharp rocks on the seafloor , where the hardest objects are smashed , where tree trunks are worn down and worked into "" a shaggy fur , "" as norwegians express it !",130
"dorian strolled along by his side . the keen aromatic air , the brown and red lights that glimmered in the wood , the hoarse cries of the beaters ringing out from time to time , and the sharp snaps of the guns that followed , fascinated him and filled him with a sense of delightful freedom . he was dominated by the carelessness of happiness , by the high indifference of joy .",38

""" you do not understand me , gentlemen , "" said d’artagnan , throwing up his head , the sharp and bold lines of which were at the moment gilded by a bright ray of the sun .

"on the 13th they passed the edge of the banks of newfoundland , a dangerous locality ; during the winter , especially , there are frequent fogs and heavy gales of wind . ever since the evening before the barometer , suddenly falling , had indicated an approaching change in the atmosphere ; and during the night the temperature varied , the cold became sharper , and the wind veered to the south - east .",64
"next morning we awoke half frozen by the sharp keen air , but with the light of a splendid sun . i rose from my granite bed and went out to enjoy the magnificent spectacle that lay unrolled before me .",8
"faithful to his mission of vengeance , athos had requested to be conducted to the garden ; and there upon the sand following the light steps of this woman , who left sharp tracks wherever she went , he advanced toward the gate which led into the wood , and causing it to be opened , he went out into the forest .",32
"it was close upon nine when he set out . i had no idea how long he might be , but i sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages of henri murger 's "" vie de bohème . "" ten o'clock passed , and i heard the footsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed . eleven , and the more stately tread of the landlady passed my door , bound for the same destination . it was close upon twelve before i heard the sharp sound of his latch - key . the instant he entered i saw by his face that he had not been successful . amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the mastery , until the former suddenly carried the day , and he burst into a hearty laugh .",91
"at mid - day we arrived . i raised my head and saw straight above me the upper aperture of the cone , framing a bit of sky of very small circumference , but almost perfectly round . just upon the edge appeared the snowy peak of saris , standing out sharp and clear against endless space .",51
"endowed doubtless with sight which enabled him to pierce the obscurity , he was always in the thick of the fight uttering from time to time -- a sharp hissing sound , which was with him the sign of great rejoicing .",28

"the next day , april 1 , when the nautilus rose to the surface of the waves a few minutes before noon , we raised land to the west . it was tierra del fuego , the land of fire , a name given it by early navigators after they saw numerous curls of smoke rising from the natives ' huts . this land of fire forms a huge cluster of islands over thirty leagues long and eighty leagues wide , extending between latitude 53 degrees and 56 degrees south , and between longitude 67 degrees 50 ' and 77 degrees 15 ' west . its coastline looked flat , but high mountains rose in the distance . i even thought i glimpsed mt . sarmiento , whose elevation is 2,070 meters above sea level : a pyramid - shaped block of shale with a very sharp summit , which , depending on whether it 's clear or veiled in vapor , "" predicts fair weather or foul , "" as ned land told me .",146
"and then at last i heard him . far away came the sharp clink of a boot striking upon a stone . then another and yet another , coming nearer and nearer . i shrank back into the darkest corner , and cocked the pistol in my pocket , determined not to discover myself until i had an opportunity of seeing something of the stranger . there was a long pause which showed that he had stopped . then once more the footsteps approached and a shadow fell across the opening of the hut .",12
"the fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen , defiant air , and put down his hands to assist . at that instant there was a sharp click , the jangling of metal , and sherlock holmes sprang to his feet again .",26

"the blowing operation had given a cylinder of glass terminated by two hemispheric caps , which were easily detached by means of a sharp iron dipped in cold water ; then , by the same proceeding , this cylinder was cut lengthways , and after having been rendered malleable by a second heating , it was extended on a plate and spread out with a wooden roller .",23

"there once more , through the panels opening into these caribbean waters ten meters below the surface of the waves , i found so many fascinating exhibits to describe in my daily notes ! among other zoophytes there were portuguese men - of - war known by the name physalia pelagica , like big , oblong bladders with a pearly sheen , spreading their membranes to the wind , letting their blue tentacles drift like silken threads ; to the eye delightful jellyfish , to the touch actual nettles that ooze a corrosive liquid . among the articulates there were annelid worms one and a half meters long , furnished with a pink proboscis , equipped with 1,700 organs of locomotion , snaking through the waters , and as they went , throwing off every gleam in the solar spectrum . from the fish branch there were manta rays , enormous cartilaginous fish ten feet long and weighing 600 pounds , their pectoral fin triangular , their midback slightly arched , their eyes attached to the edges of the face at the front of the head ; they floated like wreckage from a ship , sometimes fastening onto our windows like opaque shutters . there were american triggerfish for which nature has ground only black and white pigments , feather - shaped gobies that were long and plump with yellow fins and jutting jaws , sixteen - decimeter mackerel with short , sharp teeth , covered with small scales , and related to the albacore species . next came swarms of red mullet corseted in gold stripes from head to tail , their shining fins all aquiver , genuine masterpieces of jewelry , formerly sacred to the goddess diana , much in demand by rich romans , and about which the old saying goes : "" he who catches them does n't eat them ! "" finally , adorned with emerald ribbons and dressed in velvet and silk , golden angelfish passed before our eyes like courtiers in the paintings of veronese ; spurred gilthead stole by with their swift thoracic fins ; thread herring fifteen inches long were wrapped in their phosphorescent glimmers ; gray mullet thrashed the sea with their big fleshy tails ; red salmon seemed to mow the waves with their slicing pectorals ; and silver moonfish , worthy of their name , rose on the horizon of the waters like the whitish reflections of many moons .",242

"alice did not much like keeping so close to her : first , because the duchess was very ugly ; and secondly , because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon alice 's shoulder , and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin . however , she did not like to be rude , so she bore it as well as she could .",44

"for two hours a whole aquatic army escorted the nautilus . in the midst of their leaping and cavorting , while they competed with each other in beauty , radiance , and speed , i could distinguish some green wrasse , bewhiskered mullet marked with pairs of black lines , white gobies from the genus eleotris with curved caudal fins and violet spots on the back , wonderful japanese mackerel from the genus scomber with blue bodies and silver heads , glittering azure goldfish whose name by itself gives their full description , several varieties of porgy or gilthead ( some banded gilthead with fins variously blue and yellow , some with horizontal heraldic bars and enhanced by a black strip around their caudal area , some with color zones and elegantly corseted in their six waistbands ) , trumpetfish with flutelike beaks that looked like genuine seafaring woodcocks and were sometimes a meter long , japanese salamanders , serpentine moray eels from the genus echidna that were six feet long with sharp little eyes and a huge mouth bristling with teeth ; etc .",172
"sir francis cromarty took mr . fogg aside , and begged him to reflect before he went any further ; to which that gentleman replied that he was not in the habit of acting rashly , that a bet of twenty thousand pounds was at stake , that the elephant was absolutely necessary to him , and that he would secure him if he had to pay twenty times his value . returning to the indian , whose small , sharp eyes , glistening with avarice , betrayed that with him it was only a question of how great a price he could obtain . mr . fogg offered first twelve hundred , then fifteen hundred , eighteen hundred , two thousand pounds . passepartout , usually so rubicund , was fairly white with suspense .",80

"it was a squid of colossal dimensions , fully eight meters long . it was traveling backward with tremendous speed in the same direction as the nautilus . it gazed with enormous , staring eyes that were tinted sea green . its eight arms ( or more accurately , feet ) were rooted in its head , which has earned these animals the name cephalopod ; its arms stretched a distance twice the length of its body and were writhing like the serpentine hair of the furies . you could plainly see its 250 suckers , arranged over the inner sides of its tentacles and shaped like semispheric capsules . sometimes these suckers fastened onto the lounge window by creating vacuums against it . the monster 's mouth -- a beak made of horn and shaped like that of a parrot -- opened and closed vertically . its tongue , also of horn substance and armed with several rows of sharp teeth , would flicker out from between these genuine shears . what a freak of nature ! a bird 's beak on a mollusk ! its body was spindle - shaped and swollen in the middle , a fleshy mass that must have weighed 20,000 to 25,000 kilograms . its unstable color would change with tremendous speed as the animal grew irritated , passing successively from bluish gray to reddish brown .",160

"these various types of shrubbery were as big as trees in the temperate zones ; in the damp shade between them , there were clustered actual bushes of moving flowers , hedges of zoophytes in which there grew stony coral striped with twisting furrows , yellowish sea anemone from the genus caryophylia with translucent tentacles , plus anemone with grassy tufts from the genus zoantharia ; and to complete the illusion , minnows flitted from branch to branch like a swarm of hummingbirds , while there rose underfoot , like a covey of snipe , yellow fish from the genus lepisocanthus with bristling jaws and sharp scales , flying gurnards , and pinecone fish .",105
