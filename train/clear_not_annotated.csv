"there the ocean floor formed a valley 120 kilometers wide , into which you could fit mt . blanc without its summit poking above the surface of the waves . this valley is closed off to the east by a sheer wall 2,000 meters high . we arrived there on may 28 , and the nautilus lay no farther than 150 kilometers from ireland . would captain nemo head up north and beach us on the british isles ? no . much to my surprise , he went back down south and returned to european seas . as we swung around the emerald isle , i spotted cape clear for an instant , plus the lighthouse on fastnet rock that guides all those thousands of ships setting out from glasgow or liverpool .",108

"meanwhile preparations for this daring attempt were getting under way . the nautilus 's powerful pumps forced air down into the tanks and stored it under high pressure . near four o'clock captain nemo informed me that the platform hatches were about to be closed . i took a last look at the dense ice bank we were going to conquer . the weather was fair , the skies reasonably clear , the cold quite brisk , namely -12 degrees centigrade ; but after the wind had lulled , this temperature did n't seem too unbearable .",70

"if we accept the hypotheses of the microbiologist ehrenberg-- who believes that these underwater depths are lit up by phosphorescent organisms -- nature has certainly saved one of her most prodigious sights for residents of the sea , and i could judge for myself from the thousandfold play of the light . on both sides i had windows opening over these unexplored depths . the darkness in the lounge enhanced the brightness outside , and we stared as if this clear glass were the window of an immense aquarium .",80

"this instrument finished , the engineer returned to the beach , but as it was necessary to take the height of the pole from above a clear horizon , that is , a sea horizon , and as claw cape hid the southern horizon , he was obliged to look for a more suitable station .",26

"i reached the lodge at gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of the first of may : i stepped in there before going up to the hall . it was very clean and neat : the ornamental windows were hung with little white curtains ; the floor was spotless ; the grate and fire - irons were burnished bright , and the fire burnt clear . bessie sat on the hearth , nursing her last - born , and robert and his sister played quietly in a corner .",65
"then , neb helping him , the seaman arranged the spit , and the capybara , properly cleaned , was soon roasting like a suckling - pig before a clear , crackling fire .",29
"but this mystery would inevitably be cleared up , and soon , because captain nemo gave orders to increase speed ; at once the engine stepped up its drive power , setting the propeller in swifter rotation .",6
"it took us two hours to reach the summit of this half - crystal , half - basalt peak . from there our eyes scanned a vast sea , which scrawled its boundary line firmly against the background of the northern sky . at our feet : dazzling tracts of white . over our heads : a pale azure , clear of mists . north of us : the sun 's disk , like a ball of fire already cut into by the edge of the horizon . from the heart of the waters : jets of liquid rising like hundreds of magnificent bouquets . far off , like a sleeping cetacean : the nautilus . behind us to the south and east : an immense shore , a chaotic heap of rocks and ice whose limits we could n't see .",60

milady looked at her lover in silence . the pale light of the first rays of day gave to her clear eyes a strangely frightful expression .,20

"after clearing the outer belt of rocks via a narrow passageway , the nautilus lay inside the breakers where the sea had a depth of thirty to forty fathoms . under the green shade of some tropical evergreens , i spotted a few savages who looked extremely startled at our approach . in this long , blackish object advancing flush with the water , did n't they see some fearsome cetacean that they were obliged to view with distrust ?",1

"during the night of december 27 - 28 , the nautilus left the waterways of vanikoro behind with extraordinary speed . its heading was southwesterly , and in three days it had cleared the 750 leagues that separated la pérouse 's islands from the southeastern tip of papua .",32

"so the nautilus hove before the entrance to the world 's most dangerous strait , a passageway that even the boldest navigators hesitated to clear : the strait that luis vaez de torres faced on returning from the south seas in melanesia , the strait in which sloops of war under captain dumont d'urville ran aground in 1840 and nearly miscarried with all hands . and even the nautilus , rising superior to every danger in the sea , was about to become intimate with its coral reefs .",24

"at the point where the sailor had left his raft of wood , it began to run between the two high granite walls ; but if on the left bank the wall remained clear and abrupt , on the right bank , on the contrary , it sank gradually , the massive sides changed to isolated rocks , the rocks to stones , the stones to shingle running to the extremity of the point .",33
"the next day , february 7 , we entered the strait of bab el mandeb , whose name means "" gate of tears "" in the arabic language . twenty miles wide , it 's only fifty - two kilometers long , and with the nautilus launched at full speed , clearing it was the work of barely an hour . but i did n't see a thing , not even perim island where the british government built fortifications to strengthen aden 's position . there were many english and french steamers plowing this narrow passageway , liners going from suez to bombay , calcutta , melbourne , réunion island , and mauritius ; far too much traffic for the nautilus to make an appearance on the surface . so it wisely stayed in midwater .",51
