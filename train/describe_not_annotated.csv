""" do n't pay any attention to him , dorian , "" said the painter . "" i understand what you mean , and i believe in this girl . any one you love must be marvellous , and any girl who has the effect you describe must be fine and noble . to spiritualize one 's age -- that is something worth doing . if this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without one , if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have been sordid and ugly , if she can strip them of their selfishness and lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own , she is worthy of all your adoration , worthy of the adoration of the world . this marriage is quite right . i did not think so at first , but i admit it now . the gods made sibyl vane for you . without her you would have been incomplete .

"the prairie , across which the sledge was moving in a straight line , was as flat as a sea . it seemed like a vast frozen lake . the railroad which ran through this section ascended from the south - west to the north - west by great island , columbus , an important nebraska town , schuyler , and fremont , to omaha . it followed throughout the right bank of the platte river . the sledge , shortening this route , took a chord of the arc described by the railway . mudge was not afraid of being stopped by the platte river , because it was frozen . the road , then , was quite clear of obstacles , and phileas fogg had but two things to fear -- an accident to the sledge , and a change or calm in the wind .",90
""" my inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait did not lie , and that this fellow was indeed a baskerville . he was a son of that rodger baskerville , the younger brother of sir charles , who fled with a sinister reputation to south america , where he was said to have died unmarried . he did , as a matter of fact , marry , and had one child , this fellow , whose real name is the same as his father 's . he married beryl garcia , one of the beauties of costa rica , and , having purloined a considerable sum of public money , he changed his name to vandeleur and fled to england , where he established a school in the east of yorkshire . his reason for attempting this special line of business was that he had struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon the voyage home , and that he had used this man 's ability to make the undertaking a success . fraser , the tutor , died however , and the school which had begun well sank from disrepute into infamy . the vandeleurs found it convenient to change their name to stapleton , and he brought the remains of his fortune , his schemes for the future , and his taste for entomology to the south of england . i learned at the british museum that he was a recognized authority upon the subject , and that the name of vandeleur has been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had , in his yorkshire days , been the first to describe .",279

"the ceiling lights were off , yet the lounge was still brightly lit . this was due to the reflecting power of the walls of ice , which threw the beams of our beacon right back at us . words can not describe the effects produced by our galvanic rays on these huge , whimsically sculpted blocks , whose every angle , ridge , and facet gave off a different glow depending on the nature of the veins running inside the ice . it was a dazzling mine of gems , in particular sapphires and emeralds , whose jets of blue and green crisscrossed . here and there , opaline hues of infinite subtlety raced among sparks of light that were like so many fiery diamonds , their brilliance more than any eye could stand . the power of our beacon was increased a hundredfold , like a lamp shining through the biconvex lenses of a world - class lighthouse .",42

"little by little ned developed a taste for chatting , and i loved hearing the tales of his adventures in the polar seas . he described his fishing trips and his battles with great natural lyricism . his tales took on the form of an epic poem , and i felt i was hearing some canadian homer reciting his iliad of the high arctic regions .",25

"there once more , through the panels opening into these caribbean waters ten meters below the surface of the waves , i found so many fascinating exhibits to describe in my daily notes ! among other zoophytes there were portuguese men - of - war known by the name physalia pelagica , like big , oblong bladders with a pearly sheen , spreading their membranes to the wind , letting their blue tentacles drift like silken threads ; to the eye delightful jellyfish , to the touch actual nettles that ooze a corrosive liquid . among the articulates there were annelid worms one and a half meters long , furnished with a pink proboscis , equipped with 1,700 organs of locomotion , snaking through the waters , and as they went , throwing off every gleam in the solar spectrum . from the fish branch there were manta rays , enormous cartilaginous fish ten feet long and weighing 600 pounds , their pectoral fin triangular , their midback slightly arched , their eyes attached to the edges of the face at the front of the head ; they floated like wreckage from a ship , sometimes fastening onto our windows like opaque shutters . there were american triggerfish for which nature has ground only black and white pigments , feather - shaped gobies that were long and plump with yellow fins and jutting jaws , sixteen - decimeter mackerel with short , sharp teeth , covered with small scales , and related to the albacore species . next came swarms of red mullet corseted in gold stripes from head to tail , their shining fins all aquiver , genuine masterpieces of jewelry , formerly sacred to the goddess diana , much in demand by rich romans , and about which the old saying goes : "" he who catches them does n't eat them !
