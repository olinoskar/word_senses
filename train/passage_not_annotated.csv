"that favourable moment arrived only with six o'clock ; when my uncle , myself , the guide , two other passengers and the four horses , trusted ourselves to a somewhat fragile raft . accustomed as i was to the swift and sure steamers on the elbe , i found the oars of the rowers rather a slow means of propulsion . it took us more than an hour to cross the fiord ; but the passage was effected without any mishap .",76
"to accompany him down the long , narrow , dark passage , would have been impossible . therefore , we followed , as he bid us . the building was constructed of roughly squared timbers , with rooms on both sides , four in number , all opening out into the one passage : these were the kitchen , the weaving shop , the badstofa , or family sleeping - room , and the visitors ' room , which was the best of all . my uncle , whose height had not been thought of in building the house , of course hit his head several times against the beams that projected from the ceilings .",10

"and yet , at the very door the musketeer began to entertain some doubts . the approach was not such as to prepossess people -- an ill - smelling , dark passage , a staircase half - lighted by bars through which stole a glimmer from a neighboring yard ; on the first floor a low door studded with enormous nails , like the principal gate of the grand chatelet .",31
"the english , repulsed foot by foot , beaten in all encounters , and defeated in the passage of the isle of loie , were obliged to re - embark , leaving on the field of battle two thousand men , among whom were five colonels , three lieutenant colonels , two hundred and fifty captains , twenty gentlemen of rank , four pieces of cannon , and sixty flags , which were taken to paris by claude de st . simon , and suspended with great pomp in the arches of notre dame .",17
"audley court was not an attractive locality . the narrow passage led us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings . we picked our way among groups of dirty children , and through lines of discoloured linen , until we came to number 46 , the door of which was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name rance was engraved . on enquiry we found that the constable was in bed , and we were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming .",10
"neither at its level nor in any other part of the well , did any passage open , which could lead to the interior of the cliff .",15
"the aperture , which was almost round , was about five feet in diameter ; the dark passage was cut out in the live rock and lined with a coat of the eruptive matter which formerly issued from it ; the interior was level with the ground outside , so that we were able to enter without difficulty . we were following a horizontal plane , when , only six paces in , our progress was interrupted by an enormous block just across our way .",17

"she , with a still - smiling countenance , took his arm , and passed with him under a low arched door , which by a vaulted passage , lighted only at the farther end , led to a stone staircase around an angle of stone . they then came to a massive door , which after the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with him , turned heavily upon its hinges , and disclosed the chamber destined for milady .",27

"in certain parts of the cone there were glaciers . here hans advanced only with extreme precaution , sounding his way with his iron - pointed pole , to discover any crevasses in it . at particularly dubious passages we were obliged to connect ourselves with each other by a long cord , in order that any man who missed his footing might be held up by his companions . this solid formation was prudent , but did not remove all danger .",38

"passepartout , having received his orders , had nothing to do but obey them . he looked at his imperturbable master , and could scarcely bring his mind to leave him . his heart was full , and his conscience tortured by remorse ; for he accused himself more bitterly than ever of being the cause of the irretrievable disaster . yes ! if he had warned mr . fogg , and had betrayed fix 's projects to him , his master would certainly not have given the detective passage to liverpool , and then--",89

"once more she found herself in the long hall , and close to the little glass table . ' now , i 'll manage better this time , ' she said to herself , and began by taking the little golden key , and unlocking the door that led into the garden . then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom ( she had kept a piece of it in her pocket ) till she was about a foot high : then she walked down the little passage : and then -- she found herself at last in the beautiful garden , among the bright flower - beds and the cool fountains .",88

"the whole thing occurred in a moment — so quickly that i had no time to realize it . i have a vivid recollection of that instant , of holmes ' triumphant expression and the ring of his voice , of the cabman 's dazed , savage face , as he glared at the glittering handcuffs , which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists . for a second or two we might have been a group of statues . then , with an inarticulate roar of fury , the prisoner wrenched himself free from holmes 's grasp , and hurled himself through the window . woodwork and glass gave way before him ; but before he got quite through , gregson , lestrade , and holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds . he was dragged back into the room , and then commenced a terrific conflict . so powerful and so fierce was he , that the four of us were shaken off again and again . he appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit . his face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass , but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance . it was not until lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and half - strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail ; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his hands . that done , we rose to our feet breathless and panting .",196

"what happened when the pilot - boat came in sight of shanghai will be easily guessed . the signals made by the tankadere had been seen by the captain of the yokohama steamer , who , espying the flag at half - mast , had directed his course towards the little craft . phileas fogg , after paying the stipulated price of his passage to john busby , and rewarding that worthy with the additional sum of five hundred and fifty pounds , ascended the steamer with aouda and fix ; and they started at once for nagasaki and yokohama .",63

"all hope was now at an end . my uncle had been all the morning making purchases of a part of the tools and apparatus required for this desperate undertaking . the passage was encumbered with rope ladders , knotted cords , torches , flasks , grappling irons , alpenstocks , pickaxes , iron shod sticks , enough to load ten men .",32
"but still we marched on , and i alone was forgetting the length of the way by losing myself in the midst of geological contemplations . the temperature remained what it had been during our passage through the lava and schists . only my sense of smell was forcibly affected by an odour of protocarburet of hydrogen . i immediately recognised in this gallery the presence of a considerable quantity of the dangerous gas called by miners firedamp , the explosion of which has often occasioned such dreadful catastrophes .",35
"each picture told a story ; mysterious often to my undeveloped understanding and imperfect feelings , yet ever profoundly interesting : as interesting as the tales bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings , when she chanced to be in good humour ; and when , having brought her ironing - table to the nursery hearth , she allowed us to sit about it , and while she got up mrs . reed 's lace frills , and crimped her nightcap borders , fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads ; or ( as at a later period i discovered ) from the pages of pamela , and henry , earl of moreland .",87

"alice was not a bit hurt , and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment : she looked up , but it was all dark overhead ; before her was another long passage , and the white rabbit was still in sight , hurrying down it . there was not a moment to be lost : away went alice like the wind , and was just in time to hear it say , as it turned a corner , ' oh my ears and whiskers , how late it 's getting ! ' she was close behind it when she turned the corner , but the rabbit was no longer to be seen : she found herself in a long , low hall , which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof . there were doors all round the hall , but they were all locked ; and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other , trying every door , she walked sadly down the middle , wondering how she was ever to get out again .",35
"alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage , not much larger than a rat - hole : she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw . how she longed to get out of that dark hall , and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains , but she could not even get her head though the doorway ; ' and even if my head would go through , ' thought poor alice , ' it would be of very little use without my shoulders . oh , how i wish i could shut up like a telescope ! i think i could , if i only know how to begin . ' for , you see , so many out - of - the - way things had happened lately , that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible . there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door , so she went back to the table , half hoping she might find another key on it , or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes : this time she found a little bottle on it , ( ' which certainly was not here before , ' said alice , ) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label , with the words ' drink me ' beautifully printed on it in large letters .",12
"this was a suspension - bridge thrown over some rapids , about a mile from the place where they now were . according to the signal - man , it was in a ruinous condition , several of the iron wires being broken ; and it was impossible to risk the passage . he did not in any way exaggerate the condition of the bridge . it may be taken for granted that , rash as the americans usually are , when they are prudent there is good reason for it .",51
