""" it certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little dull -- less for you , perhaps , than for your sister . """,4
"this thirty feet , which it was necessary to cross from the wood to the palisade , constituted the dangerous zone , to borrow a ballistic term : in fact , one or more bullets fired from behind the palisade might knock over any one who ventured on to this zone .",9
"this incident did not interrupt our walk . for two hours we were sometimes led over plains of sand , sometimes over prairies of seaweed that were quite arduous to cross . in all honesty , i was dead tired by the time i spotted a hazy glow half a mile away , cutting through the darkness of the waters . it was the nautilus 's beacon . within twenty minutes we would be on board , and there i could breathe easy again -- because my tank 's current air supply seemed to be quite low in oxygen . but i was reckoning without an encounter that slightly delayed our arrival .",30

"now , if the convicts were suspecting nothing , if they knew nothing of the expedition against them , if , lastly , there now existed a chance of surprising them , ought this chance to be lost by inconsiderately attempting to cross the palisades ?",42
""" i find that before the terrible event occurred several people had seen a creature upon the moor which corresponds with this baskerville demon , and which could not possibly be any animal known to science . they all agreed that it was a huge creature , luminous , ghastly , and spectral . i have cross - examined these men , one of them a hard - headed countryman , one a farrier , and one a moorland farmer , who all tell the same story of this dreadful apparition , exactly corresponding to the hell - hound of the legend . i assure you that there is a reign of terror in the district , and that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at night .

"then the pallbearers approached . wrapped in white fabric made from filaments of the fan mussel , the body was lowered into its watery grave . captain nemo , arms crossed over his chest , knelt in a posture of prayer , as did all the friends of him who had loved them . . . . my two companions and i bowed reverently .",30
""" there is really not much to tell , "" cried dorian as they took their seats at the small round table . "" what happened was simply this . after i left you yesterday evening , harry , i dressed , had some dinner at that little italian restaurant in rupert street you introduced me to , and went down at eight o'clock to the theatre . sibyl was playing rosalind . of course , the scenery was dreadful and the orlando absurd . but sibyl ! you should have seen her ! when she came on in her boy 's clothes , she was perfectly wonderful . she wore a moss - coloured velvet jerkin with cinnamon sleeves , slim , brown , cross - gartered hose , a dainty little green cap with a hawk 's feather caught in a jewel , and a hooded cloak lined with dull red . she had never seemed to me more exquisite . she had all the delicate grace of that tanagra figurine that you have in your studio , basil . her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round a pale rose . as for her acting -- well , you shall see her to - night . she is simply a born artist .",125
"the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit , who said in a low voice , ' your majesty must cross - examine this witness . '",20

"so saying , he leaped lightly onto the sand . his heart must have been throbbing with intense excitement . he scaled an overhanging rock that ended in a small promontory and there , mute and motionless , with crossed arms and blazing eyes , he seemed to be laying claim to these southernmost regions . after spending five minutes in this trance , he turned to us .",39

""" especially , "" i replied , "" if it happens that we have only crossed it in its narrowest part . and it is a curious circumstance , "" i added , "" that if my computations are right , and we are nine hundred leagues from rejkiavik , we have now the mediterranean above our head . """,15
"d’artagnan inquired of everyone he met with , went down to the ferry , came up again by the rue de seine , and the red cross ; but nothing , absolutely nothing !",26
"in the broad electric daylight , an enormous black mass , quite motionless , hung suspended in the midst of the waters . i observed it carefully , trying to find out the nature of this gigantic cetacean . then a sudden thought crossed my mind .",43
""" yes , sir ! the avenger ! a splendid name ! "" captain nemo murmured , crossing his arms .",17
""" just listen to me , "" i said firmly . "" ambition must have a limit somewhere ; we can not perform impossibilities ; we are not at all fit for another sea voyage ; who would dream of undertaking a voyage of five hundred leagues upon a heap of rotten planks , with a blanket in rags for a sail , a stick for a mast , and fierce winds in our teeth ? we can not steer ; we shall be buffeted by the tempests , and we should be fools and madmen to attempt to cross a second time .
