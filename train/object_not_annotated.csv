"nor was this all . fresh discoveries of remains in the pleiocene formation had emboldened other geologists to refer back the human species to a higher antiquity still . it is true that these remains were not human bones , but objects bearing the traces of his handiwork , such as fossil leg - bones of animals , sculptured and carved evidently by the hand of man .",41
"before i could reply , white smoke streamed from the battleship 's bow . then , a few seconds later , the waters splashed astern of the nautilus , disturbed by the fall of a heavy object . soon after , an explosion struck my ears .",36
"after clearing the outer belt of rocks via a narrow passageway , the nautilus lay inside the breakers where the sea had a depth of thirty to forty fathoms . under the green shade of some tropical evergreens , i spotted a few savages who looked extremely startled at our approach . in this long , blackish object advancing flush with the water , did n't they see some fearsome cetacean that they were obliged to view with distrust ?",57
"we had long lost sight of the sea shore behind the hills of bones . the rash professor , careless of losing his way , hurried me forward . we advanced in silence , bathed in luminous electric fluid . by some phenomenon which i am unable to explain , it lighted up all sides of every object equally . such was its diffusiveness , there being no central point from which the light emanated , that shadows no longer existed . you might have thought yourself under the rays of a vertical sun in a tropical region at noonday and the height of summer . no vapour was visible . the rocks , the distant mountains , a few isolated clumps of forest trees in the distance , presented a weird and wonderful aspect under these totally new conditions of a universal diffusion of light . we were like hoffmann 's shadowless man .",57
"in essence , over a period of time several ships had encountered "" an enormous thing "" at sea , a long spindle - shaped object , sometimes giving off a phosphorescent glow , infinitely bigger and faster than any whale .",25
"now then , it did exist , this was an undeniable fact ; and since the human mind dotes on objects of wonder , you can understand the worldwide excitement caused by this unearthly apparition . as for relegating it to the realm of fiction , that charge had to be dropped .",20
"thus the night passed . at dawn , the half - extinguished disc of the sun rose above a misty horizon ; but it was now possible to recognise objects two miles off . phileas fogg and the squad had gone southward ; in the south all was still vacancy . it was then seven o'clock .",29

"this was where the nautilus had been sent accidentally-- or perhaps deliberately -- by its captain . it was sweeping around in a spiral whose radius kept growing smaller and smaller . the skiff , still attached to the ship 's plating , was likewise carried around at dizzying speed . i could feel us whirling . i was experiencing that accompanying nausea that follows such continuous spinning motions . we were in dread , in the last stages of sheer horror , our blood frozen in our veins , our nerves numb , drenched in cold sweat as if from the throes of dying ! and what a noise around our frail skiff ! what roars echoing from several miles away ! what crashes from the waters breaking against sharp rocks on the seafloor , where the hardest objects are smashed , where tree trunks are worn down and worked into "" a shaggy fur , "" as norwegians express it !",139

"in a few minutes the settlers had reached the lower point of the lake , and a glance showed them that the object had been attained .",22
"after going down a fairly steep slope , our feet trod the floor of a sort of circular pit . there captain nemo stopped , and his hand indicated an object that i had n't yet noticed . it was an oyster of extraordinary dimensions , a titanic giant clam , a holy - water font that could have held a whole lake , a basin more than two meters wide , hence even bigger than the one adorning the nautilus 's lounge .",30

"i share maury 's view , and i was able to study the phenomenon in this exclusive setting where ships rarely go . above us , huddled among the brown weeds , there floated objects originating from all over : tree trunks ripped from the rocky mountains or the andes and sent floating down the amazon or the mississippi , numerous pieces of wreckage , remnants of keels or undersides , bulwarks staved in and so weighed down with seashells and barnacles , they could n't rise to the surface of the ocean . and the passing years will someday bear out maury 's other view that by collecting in this way over the centuries , these substances will be turned to stone by the action of the waters and will then form inexhaustible coalfields . valuable reserves prepared by farseeing nature for that time when man will have exhausted his mines on the continents .",34

"i made no answer , but went and sat forward . the northern shore was already beginning to dip under the horizon . the eastern and western strands spread wide as if to bid us farewell . before our eyes lay far and wide a vast sea ; shadows of great clouds swept heavily over its silver - grey surface ; the glistening bluish rays of electric light , here and there reflected by the dancing drops of spray , shot out little sheaves of light from the track we left in our rear . soon we entirely lost sight of land ; no object was left for the eye to judge by , and but for the frothy track of the raft , i might have thought we were standing still .",104
