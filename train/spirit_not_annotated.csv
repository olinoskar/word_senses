"it was not so easy to get to cayenne . they knew pretty nearly whereabouts it lay ; but the mountains , rivers , precipices , robbers , savages , were dreadful obstacles in the way . their horses died with fatigue and their provisions were at an end . they subsisted a whole month on wild fruit , till at length they came to a little river bordered with cocoa trees ; the sight of which at once revived their drooping spirits and furnished nourishment for their enfeebled bodies .",82
"if in our trio there was a superior and a leader , it was diana . physically , she far excelled me : she was handsome ; she was vigorous . in her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow , such as excited my wonder , while it baffled my comprehension .",34
"and there were provisions too : this was not a large parcel , but it was comforting to know that of essence of beef and biscuits there were six months ' consumption . spirits were the only liquid , and of water we took none ; but we had flasks , and my uncle depended on springs from which to fill them . whatever objections i hazarded as to their quality , temperature , and even absence , remained ineffectual .",33

"had he travelled ? it was likely , for no one seemed to know the world more familiarly ; there was no spot so secluded that he did not appear to have an intimate acquaintance with it . he often corrected , with a few clear words , the thousand conjectures advanced by members of the club as to lost and unheard - of travellers , pointing out the true probabilities , and seeming as if gifted with a sort of second sight , so often did events justify his predictions . he must have travelled everywhere , at least in the spirit .",102

"fix did not look at the state of things in the same light . the storm greatly pleased him . his satisfaction would have been complete had the rangoon been forced to retreat before the violence of wind and waves . each delay filled him with hope , for it became more and more probable that fogg would be obliged to remain some days at hong kong ; and now the heavens themselves became his allies , with the gusts and squalls . it mattered not that they made him sea - sick -- he made no account of this inconvenience ; and , whilst his body was writhing under their effects , his spirit bounded with hopeful exultation .",114

"these were the only words he uttered during the journey . aouda , cosily packed in furs and cloaks , was sheltered as much as possible from the attacks of the freezing wind . as for passepartout , his face was as red as the sun 's disc when it sets in the mist , and he laboriously inhaled the biting air . with his natural buoyancy of spirits , he began to hope again . they would reach new york on the evening , if not on the morning , of the 11th , and there was still some chances that it would be before the steamer sailed for liverpool .",68

"sometimes all , as with one consent , suspended their by - play to observe and listen to the principal actors : for , after all , mr . rochester and -- because closely connected with him -- miss ingram were the life and soul of the party . if he was absent from the room an hour , a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the spirits of his guests ; and his re - entrance was sure to give a fresh impulse to the vivacity of conversation .",67

"it was an insane idea . fortunately i controlled myself and stretched out on the bed to soothe my bodily agitation . my nerves calmed a little , but with my brain so aroused , i did a swift review of my whole existence aboard the nautilus , every pleasant or unpleasant incident that had crossed my path since i went overboard from the abraham lincoln : the underwater hunting trip , the torres strait , our running aground , the savages of papua , the coral cemetery , the suez passageway , the island of santorini , the cretan diver , the bay of vigo , atlantis , the ice bank , the south pole , our imprisonment in the ice , the battle with the devilfish , the storm in the gulf stream , the avenger , and that horrible scene of the vessel sinking with its crew . . . ! all these events passed before my eyes like backdrops unrolling upstage in a theater . in this strange setting captain nemo then grew fantastically . his features were accentuated , taking on superhuman proportions . he was no longer my equal , he was the man of the waters , the spirit of the seas .",205

"in the midst of the stone mazes furrowing this atlantic seafloor , captain nemo moved forward without hesitation . he knew this dark path . no doubt he had often traveled it and was incapable of losing his way . i followed him with unshakeable confidence . he seemed like some spirit of the sea , and as he walked ahead of me , i marveled at his tall figure , which stood out in black against the glowing background of the horizon .",51

"but there was no other place in the house so secure from prying eyes as this . he had the key , and no one else could enter it . beneath its purple pall , the face painted on the canvas could grow bestial , sodden , and unclean . what did it matter ? no one could see it . he himself would not see it . why should he watch the hideous corruption of his soul ? he kept his youth-- that was enough . and , besides , might not his nature grow finer , after all ? there was no reason that the future should be so full of shame . some love might come across his life , and purify him , and shield him from those sins that seemed to be already stirring in spirit and in flesh-- those curious unpictured sins whose very mystery lent them their subtlety and their charm . perhaps , some day , the cruel look would have passed away from the scarlet sensitive mouth , and he might show to the world basil hallward 's masterpiece .",140
"this promise was given on november 2 . it had the immediate effect of reviving the crew 's failing spirits . the ocean was observed with renewed care . each man wanted one last look with which to sum up his experience . spyglasses functioned with feverish energy . a supreme challenge had been issued to the giant narwhale , and the latter had no acceptable excuse for ignoring this summons to appear !",19
"his action was alternately vivacious and sullen . his voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision ( when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance ) to that species of energetic concision — that abrupt , weighty , unhurried , and hollow - sounding enunciation — that leaden , self - balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance , which may be observed in the lost drunkard , or the irreclaimable eater of opium , during the periods of his most intense excitement .",20
"he remembered something like it in history . was it not plato , that artist in thought , who had first analyzed it ? was it not buonarotti who had carved it in the coloured marbles of a sonnet - sequence ? but in our own century it was strange . . . . yes ; he would try to be to dorian gray what , without knowing it , the lad was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderful portrait . he would seek to dominate him -- had already , indeed , half done so . he would make that wonderful spirit his own . there was something fascinating in this son of love and death .",104

"but there were ample signs that i had not come upon a false scent . this was certainly where the man lived . some blankets rolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which neolithic man had once slumbered . the ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate . beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket half - full of water . a litter of empty tins showed that the place had been occupied for some time , and i saw , as my eyes became accustomed to the checkered light , a pannikin and a half - full bottle of spirits standing in the corner . in the middle of the hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table , and upon this stood a small cloth bundle -- the same , no doubt , which i had seen through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy . it contained a loaf of bread , a tinned tongue , and two tins of preserved peaches . as i set it down again , after having examined it , my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it . i raised it , and this was what i read , roughly scrawled in pencil:--",109
