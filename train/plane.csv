"having reached a spot about twenty feet from the edge of the beach , and nearly five hundred feet from the cliff , which rose perpendicularly , harding thrust the pole two feet into the sand , and wedging it up carefully , he managed , by means of the plumb - line , to erect it perpendicularly with the plane of the horizon .",60,"('plane', 'plan', 'plano')",0
"they sawed , they planed , they filed , they turned ; and during the whole of this bad season , nothing was heard but the grinding of tools or the humming of the turning - lathe which responded to the growling of the thunder .",4,"('plane', 'raboter', 'serrar')",1
""" in order to steer this boat to port or starboard , in short , to make turns on a horizontal plane , i use an ordinary , wide - bladed rudder that 's fastened to the rear of the sternpost and worked by a wheel and tackle . but i can also move the nautilus upward and downward on a vertical plane by the simple method of slanting its two fins , which are attached to its sides at its center of flotation ; these fins are flexible , able to assume any position , and can be operated from inside by means of powerful levers . if these fins stay parallel with the boat , the latter moves horizontally . if they slant , the nautilus follows the angle of that slant and , under its propeller 's thrust , either sinks on a diagonal as steep as it suits me , or rises on that diagonal . and similarly , if i want to return more swiftly to the surface , i throw the propeller in gear , and the water 's pressure makes the nautilus rise vertically , as an air balloon inflated with hydrogen lifts swiftly into the skies .

"now , to construct a simple boat even with the necessary tools , was a difficult work , and the colonists not having tools they must begin by making hammers , axes , adzes , saws , augers , planes , etc . , which would take some time .",39,"('plane', 'rabot', 'cepillo')",2
