"it was not so easy to get to cayenne . they knew pretty nearly whereabouts it lay ; but the mountains , rivers , precipices , robbers , savages , were dreadful obstacles in the way . their horses died with fatigue and their provisions were at an end . they subsisted a whole month on wild fruit , till at length they came to a little river bordered with cocoa trees ; the sight of which at once revived their drooping spirits and furnished nourishment for their enfeebled bodies .",74

"we walked upon granite mingled with siliceous tufa . the soil shivers and shakes under our feet , like the sides of an overheated boiler filled with steam struggling to get loose . we come in sight of a small central basin , out of which the geyser springs . i plunge a register thermometer into the boiling water . it marks an intense heat of 325 ° , which is far above the boiling point ; therefore this water issues from an ardent furnace , which is not at all in harmony with professor liedenbrock 's theories . i can not help making the remark .",36
"sometimes a passing breeze raised the covering of ashes , and the two colonists , enveloped in a whirlwind of dust , lost sight of each other .",23
"in two days more we sighted the coast of scotland near peterhead , and the _ valkyria _ turned her lead towards the faroe islands , passing between the orkneys and shetlands .",5
"at half - past twelve the travellers caught sight for an instant of fort halleck , which commands that section ; and in a few more hours the rocky mountains were crossed . there was reason to hope , then , that no accident would mark the journey through this difficult country . the snow had ceased falling , and the air became crisp and cold . large birds , frightened by the locomotive , rose and flew off in the distance . no wild beast appeared on the plain . it was a desert in its vast nakedness .",8
"for ned land , as well as for every navigator before us , i knew that this was the great insurmountable obstacle . when the sun appeared for an instant near noon , captain nemo took a reasonably accurate sight that gave our position as longitude 51 degrees 30 ' and latitude 67 degrees 39 ' south . this was a position already well along in these antarctic regions .",39
"alice was not a bit hurt , and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment : she looked up , but it was all dark overhead ; before her was another long passage , and the white rabbit was still in sight , hurrying down it . there was not a moment to be lost : away went alice like the wind , and was just in time to hear it say , as it turned a corner , ' oh my ears and whiskers , how late it 's getting ! ' she was close behind it when she turned the corner , but the rabbit was no longer to be seen : she found herself in a long , low hall , which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof . there were doors all round the hall , but they were all locked ; and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other , trying every door , she walked sadly down the middle , wondering how she was ever to get out again .",44
"the _ valkyria _ kept at some distance from the coast , taking a westerly course amidst great shoals of whales and sharks . soon we came in sight of an enormous perforated rock , through which the sea dashed furiously . the westman islets seemed to rise out of the ocean like a group of rocks in a liquid plain . from that time the schooner took a wide berth and swept at a great distance round cape rejkianess , which forms the western point of iceland .",28
"forty - eight hours after , coming out of a storm which forced the schooner to scud under bare poles , we sighted east of us the beacon on cape skagen , where dangerous rocks extend far away seaward . an icelandic pilot came on board , and in three hours the _ valkyria _ dropped her anchor before rejkiavik , in faxa bay .",22
""" because captain nemo recognizes that we have n't given up all hope of recovering our freedom , and he 'll keep on his guard , above all in seas within sight of the coasts of europe . """,31
"while we were walking , i thought the lights of our ruhmkorff devices would automatically attract some inhabitants of these dark strata . but if they did approach us , at least they kept at a distance regrettable from the hunter 's standpoint . several times i saw captain nemo stop and take aim with his rifle ; then , after sighting down its barrel for a few seconds , he would straighten up and resume his walk .",61
"herbert and neb climbed a high rock to survey the sea , but there was nothing in sight -- neither a dismasted vessel nor a ship under sail .",17
""" he gazed at me with bleared , drunken eyes for a moment , and then i saw a horror spring up in them , and convulse his whole features , which showed me that he knew me . he staggered back with a livid face , and i saw the perspiration break out upon his brow , while his teeth chattered in his head . at the sight , i leaned my back against the door and laughed loud and long . i had always known that vengeance would be sweet , but i had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me .",68
"it was about two hours before night when , our guide being something before us , and not just in sight , out rushed three monstrous wolves , and after them a bear , from a hollow way adjoining to a thick wood ; two of the wolves made at the guide , and had he been far before us , he would have been devoured before we could have helped him ; one of them fastened upon his horse , and the other attacked the man with such violence , that he had not time , or presence of mind enough , to draw his pistol , but hallooed and cried out to us most lustily . my man friday being next me , i bade him ride up and see what was the matter . as soon as friday came in sight of the man , he hallooed out as loud as the other , “ o master ! o master ! ” but like a bold fellow , rode directly up to the poor man , and with his pistol shot the wolf in the head that attacked him .",20

"' --and just take his head off outside , ' the queen added to one of the officers : but the hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door .",25
"and every moment burst forth the hurrahs of the delighted sailor when he caught sight of the barrels of gunpowder , firearms and sidearms , balls of cotton , implements of husbandry , carpenter 's , joiner 's , and blacksmith 's tools , and boxes of all kinds of seeds , not in the least injured by their short sojourn in the water .",14
"by july 23 the great eastern was lying no farther than 800 kilometers from newfoundland when it received telegraphed news from ireland of an armistice signed between prussia and austria after the battle of sadova . through the mists on the 27th , it sighted the port of heart 's content . the undertaking had ended happily , and in its first dispatch , young america addressed old europe with these wise words so rarely understood : "" glory to god in the highest , and peace on earth to men of good will . """,44
"but the nautilus kept gravitating southward . on may 30 , in sight of land 's end , it passed between the lowermost tip of england and the scilly islands , which it left behind to starboard .",12
"on november 26 , at three o'clock in the morning , the nautilus cleared the tropic of cancer at longitude 172 degrees . on the 27th it passed in sight of the hawaiian islands , where the famous captain cook met his death on february 14 , 1779 . by then we had fared 4,860 leagues from our starting point . when i arrived on the platform that morning , i saw the island of hawaii two miles to leeward , the largest of the seven islands making up this group . i could clearly distinguish the tilled soil on its outskirts , the various mountain chains running parallel with its coastline , and its volcanoes , crowned by mauna kea , whose elevation is 5,000 meters above sea level . among other specimens from these waterways , our nets brought up some peacock - tailed flabellarian coral , polyps flattened into stylish shapes and unique to this part of the ocean .",29
"in a few moments , the engineer , gideon spilett , and herbert had rejoined their two companions , and like them , they kept out of sight behind the heaps of basalt .",27
"a few minutes before the sun passed its zenith , captain nemo raised his sextant and took his sights with the utmost precision . the absolute calm of the waves facilitated this operation . the nautilus lay motionless , neither rolling nor pitching .",18
"during this crossing , the sea continually lavished us with the most marvelous sights . its variety was infinite . it changed its setting and decor for the mere pleasure of our eyes , and we were called upon not simply to contemplate the works of our creator in the midst of the liquid element , but also to probe the ocean 's most daunting mysteries .",13
"while he took his sights with his sextant , one of the nautilus 's sailors-- that muscular man who had gone with us to crespo island during our first underwater excursion -- came up to clean the glass panes of the beacon . i then examined the fittings of this mechanism , whose power was increased a hundredfold by biconvex lenses that were designed like those in a lighthouse and kept its rays productively focused . this electric lamp was so constructed as to yield its maximum illuminating power . in essence , its light was generated in a vacuum , insuring both its steadiness and intensity . such a vacuum also reduced wear on the graphite points between which the luminous arc expanded . this was an important savings for captain nemo , who could n't easily renew them . but under these conditions , wear and tear were almost nonexistent .",4
"the thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were watching caught sight of the number on our door , and ran rapidly across the roadway . we heard a loud knock , a deep voice below , and heavy steps ascending the stair .",16
"the next day , march 20 , it stopped snowing . the cold was a little more brisk . the thermometer marked -2 degrees centigrade . the mist had cleared , and on that day i hoped our noon sights could be accomplished .",39
""" on a frosty winter afternoon , i rode in sight of thornfield hall . abhorred spot ! i expected no peace -- no pleasure there .",10
