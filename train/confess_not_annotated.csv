"fix , it must be confessed , understood nothing of what was going on . the conquest of the henrietta , the bribery of the crew , fogg managing the boat like a skilled seaman , amazed and confused him . he did not know what to think . for , after all , a man who began by stealing fifty - five thousand pounds might end by stealing a vessel ; and fix was not unnaturally inclined to conclude that the henrietta under fogg 's command , was not going to liverpool at all , but to some part of the world where the robber , turned into a pirate , would quietly put himself in safety . the conjecture was at least a plausible one , and the detective began to seriously regret that he had embarked on the affair .",5
