"while they were disputing on this important subject , and still expecting miss cunegund , candide perceived a young theatin friar in the piazza san marco , with a girl under his arm . the theatin looked fresh - colored , plump , and vigorous ; his eyes sparkled ; his air and gait were bold and lofty . the girl was pretty , and was singing a song ; and every now and then gave her theatin an amorous ogle and wantonly pinched his ruddy cheeks .",12

"just as they rose from table , in came four serene highnesses , who had also been stripped of their territories by the fortune of war , and had come to spend the remainder of the carnival at venice . candide took no manner of notice of them ; for his thoughts were wholly employed on his voyage to constantinople , where he intended to go in search of his lovely miss cunegund .",71

"at that hour most of the others were sewing likewise ; but one class still stood round miss scatcherd 's chair reading , and as all was quiet , the subject of their lessons could be heard , together with the manner in which each girl acquitted herself , and the animadversions or commendations of miss scatcherd on the performance .",55
""" what a chain of shocking accidents ! "" exclaimed candide . "" but after all , i have still some diamonds left , with which i can easily procure miss cunegund 's liberty .",30
"i kept expecting that miss scatcherd would praise her attention ; but , instead of that , she suddenly cried out--",4
"there were two slaves among the crew of the galley , who rowed very ill , and to whose bare backs the master of the vessel frequently applied a lash . candide , from natural sympathy , looked at these two slaves more attentively than at any of the rest , and drew near them with an eye of pity . their features , though greatly disfigured , appeared to him to bear a strong resemblance with those of pangloss and the unhappy baron jesuit , miss cunegund 's brother .",86
"this ominous tool she presented to miss scatcherd with a respectful curtesy ; then she quietly , and without being told , unloosed her pinafore , and the teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the bunch of twigs .",6

"the first objects they beheld there , were miss cunegund and the old woman , who were hanging some tablecloths on a line to dry .",8
"candide had , in truth , no great inclination to marry miss cunegund ; but the extreme impertinence of the baron determined him to conclude the match ; and cunegund pressed him so warmly , that he could not recant .",11
"i can remember miss temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping line , her plaid cloak , which the frosty wind fluttered , gathered close about her , and encouraging us , by precept and example , to keep up our spirits , and march forward , as she said , "" like stalwart soldiers . """,3
"there was none , down to brother giroflee , but did some service ; he was a very good carpenter , and became an honest man . pangloss used now and then to say to candide : "" there is a concatenation of all events in the best of possible worlds ; for , in short , had you not been kicked out of a fine castle for the love of miss cunegund ; had you not been put into the inquisition ; had you not traveled over america on foot ; had you not run the baron through the body ; and had you not lost all your sheep , which you brought from the good country of el dorado , you would not have been here to eat preserved citrons and pistachio nuts .

"miss adele , a ward he had , was put to school . he broke off acquaintance with all the gentry , and shut himself up like a hermit at the hall . """,0
"this is what i have to ask,--why did you take such pains to make me believe you wished to marry miss ingram ? """,20
"these ladies were deferentially received by miss temple , as mrs . and the misses brocklehurst , and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the room .",14
""" well , i feigned courtship of miss ingram , because i wished to render you as madly in love with me as i was with you ; and i knew jealousy would be the best ally i could call in for the furtherance of that end . """,7

"with this sublime conclusion , mr . brocklehurst adjusted the top button of his surtout , muttered something to his family , who rose , bowed to miss temple , and then all the great people sailed in state from the room .",27
""" i feel so astonished , "" she began , "" i hardly know what to say to you , miss eyre .",20

"for his part , conseil thought he spotted a turtle six feet wide and adorned with three protruding ridges that ran lengthwise . i was sorry to miss this reptile , because from conseil 's description , i believe i recognized the leatherback turtle , a pretty rare species . for my part , i noted only some loggerhead turtles with long carapaces .",27
