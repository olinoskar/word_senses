"extending over an expanse of 100 leagues north to south , and over 90 leagues east to west , this island group lies between latitude 2 degrees and 6 degrees south , and between longitude 174 degrees and 179 degrees west . it consists of a number of islands , islets , and reefs , among which we noted the islands of viti levu , vanua levu , and kadavu .",15
"i went looking in the library for a book about this island , one of the most fertile in the world . sure enough , i found a volume entitled ceylon and the singhalese by h. c. sirr , esq . reentering the lounge , i first noted the bearings of ceylon , on which antiquity lavished so many different names . it was located between latitude 5 degrees 55 ' and 9 degrees 49 ' north , and between longitude 79 degrees 42 ' and 82 degrees 4 ' east of the meridian of greenwich ; its length is 275 miles ; its maximum width , 150 miles ; its circumference , 900 miles ; its surface area , 24,448 square miles , in other words , a little smaller than that of ireland .",90
"pencroft took a reef in the mainsail , and steered towards the north - east , so as to sail straight for lincoln island .",14
"at that moment the moon appeared in the east , above the black curtain of the forest , and a white sheet of light spread over the interior of the enclosure .",8
"in the northeast there emerged two volcanic islands of unequal size , surrounded by a coral reef whose circuit measured forty miles . we were facing the island of vanikoro proper , to which captain dumont d'urville had given the name "" island of the search "" ; we lay right in front of the little harbor of vana , located in latitude 16 degrees 4 ' south and longitude 164 degrees 32 ' east . its shores seemed covered with greenery from its beaches to its summits inland , crowned by mt . kapogo , which is 476 fathoms high .",74
""" professor , "" captain nemo then told me , "" there are pearl fisheries in the bay of bengal , the seas of the east indies , the seas of china and japan , plus those seas south of the united states , the gulf of panama and the gulf of california ; but it 's off ceylon that such fishing reaps its richest rewards . no doubt we 'll be arriving a little early . fishermen gather in the gulf of mannar only during the month of march , and for thirty days some 300 boats concentrate on the lucrative harvest of these treasures from the sea . each boat is manned by ten oarsmen and ten fishermen . the latter divide into two groups , dive in rotation , and descend to a depth of twelve meters with the help of a heavy stone clutched between their feet and attached by a rope to their boat .

"dillon returned to calcutta . there he was able to interest the asiatic society and the east india company in his discovery . a ship named after the search was placed at his disposal , and he departed on january 23 , 1827 , accompanied by a french deputy .",16
"so captain dumont d'urville had put to sea in command of a vessel named after the astrolabe , and just two months after dillon had left vanikoro , dumont d'urville dropped anchor before hobart . there he heard about dillon 's findings , and he further learned that a certain james hobbs , chief officer on the union out of calcutta , had put to shore on an island located in latitude 8 degrees 18 ' south and longitude 156 degrees 30 ' east , and had noted the natives of those waterways making use of iron bars and red fabrics .",83
"i stayed in my stateroom . i wanted to avoid the captain , to hide from his eyes the agitation overwhelming me . what an agonizing day i spent , torn between my desire to regain my free will and my regret at abandoning this marvelous nautilus , leaving my underwater research incomplete ! how could i relinquish this ocean--""my own atlantic , "" as i liked to call it -- without observing its lower strata , without wresting from it the kinds of secrets that had been revealed to me by the seas of the east indies and the pacific ! i was putting down my novel half read , i was waking up as my dream neared its climax ! how painfully the hours passed , as i sometimes envisioned myself safe on shore with my companions , or , despite my better judgment , as i sometimes wished that some unforeseen circumstances would prevent ned land from carrying out his plans .",96
"it took us two hours to reach the summit of this half - crystal , half - basalt peak . from there our eyes scanned a vast sea , which scrawled its boundary line firmly against the background of the northern sky . at our feet : dazzling tracts of white . over our heads : a pale azure , clear of mists . north of us : the sun 's disk , like a ball of fire already cut into by the edge of the horizon . from the heart of the waters : jets of liquid rising like hundreds of magnificent bouquets . far off , like a sleeping cetacean : the nautilus . behind us to the south and east : an immense shore , a chaotic heap of rocks and ice whose limits we could n't see .",122
"happily , this enclosure , sheltered by the southeastern spur of mount franklin , did not greatly suffer from the violence of the hurricanes , which spared its trees , sheds , and palisades ; but the poultry - yard on prospect heights , being directly exposed to the gusts of wind from the east , suffered considerable damage .",54
""" my inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait did not lie , and that this fellow was indeed a baskerville . he was a son of that rodger baskerville , the younger brother of sir charles , who fled with a sinister reputation to south america , where he was said to have died unmarried . he did , as a matter of fact , marry , and had one child , this fellow , whose real name is the same as his father 's . he married beryl garcia , one of the beauties of costa rica , and , having purloined a considerable sum of public money , he changed his name to vandeleur and fled to england , where he established a school in the east of yorkshire . his reason for attempting this special line of business was that he had struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon the voyage home , and that he had used this man 's ability to make the undertaking a success . fraser , the tutor , died however , and the school which had begun well sank from disrepute into infamy . the vandeleurs found it convenient to change their name to stapleton , and he brought the remains of his fortune , his schemes for the future , and his taste for entomology to the south of england . i learned at the british museum that he was a recognized authority upon the subject , and that the name of vandeleur has been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had , in his yorkshire days , been the first to describe .",131
"here is what those circumstances entailed . two miles to starboard lay gueboroa island , its coastline curving north to west like an immense arm . to the south and east , heads of coral were already on display , left uncovered by the ebbing waters . we had run aground at full tide and in one of those seas whose tides are moderate , an inconvenient state of affairs for floating the nautilus off . however , the ship had n't suffered in any way , so solidly joined was its hull . but although it could neither sink nor split open , it was in serious danger of being permanently attached to these reefs , and that would have been the finish of captain nemo 's submersible .",30

"but at a later period a wide chasm formed diagonally from south - west to north - east , through which was gradually forced out the trachyte which was to form a mountain chain . no violence accompanied this change ; the matter thrown out was in vast quantities , and the liquid material oozing out from the abysses of the earth slowly spread in extensive plains or in hillocky masses . to this period belong the felspar , syenites , and porphyries .",17
"the wharves of brooklyn , and every part of new york bordering the east river , were crowded with curiosity seekers . departing from 500,000 throats , three cheers burst forth in succession . thousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses , hailing the abraham lincoln until it reached the waters of the hudson river , at the tip of the long peninsula that forms new york city .",13
"during the first days , they went along smoothly enough . the sea was not very unpropitious , the wind seemed stationary in the north - east , the sails were hoisted , and the henrietta ploughed across the waves like a real trans - atlantic steamer .",26
"it could already be seen that , of the numerous valleys branching off at the base of mount franklin , three only were wooded and rich in pasturage like that of the corral , which bordered on the west on the falls river valley , and on the east on the red creek valley .",48
"on the 13th they passed the edge of the banks of newfoundland , a dangerous locality ; during the winter , especially , there are frequent fogs and heavy gales of wind . ever since the evening before the barometer , suddenly falling , had indicated an approaching change in the atmosphere ; and during the night the temperature varied , the cold became sharper , and the wind veered to the south - east .",74
"my father , indeed , imposed the determination , but since his death , i have not a legitimate obstacle to contend with ; some affairs settled , a successor for morton provided , an entanglement or two of the feelings broken through or cut asunder -- a last conflict with human weakness , in which i know i shall overcome , because i have vowed that i _ will _ overcome -- and i leave europe for the east .

"this tree is distinguished from other trees by a straight trunk forty feet high . to the naturalist 's eye , its gracefully rounded crown , formed of big multilobed leaves , was enough to denote the artocarpus that has been so successfully transplanted to the mascarene islands east of madagascar . from its mass of greenery , huge globular fruit stood out , a decimeter wide and furnished on the outside with creases that assumed a hexangular pattern . it 's a handy plant that nature gives to regions lacking in wheat ; without needing to be cultivated , it bears fruit eight months out of the year .",48
"night came . the moon was entering her first quarter , and her insufficient light would soon die out in the mist on the horizon . clouds were rising from the east , and already overcast a part of the heavens .",31
"the frigate sailed along the east coast of south america with prodigious speed . by july 3 we were at the entrance to the strait of magellan , abreast of cabo de las virgenes . but commander farragut was unwilling to attempt this tortuous passageway and maneuvered instead to double cape horn . the crew sided with him unanimously . indeed , were we likely to encounter the narwhale in such a cramped strait ? many of our sailors swore that the monster could n't negotiate this passageway simply because "" he 's too big for it !

"from the black markings on the tips of its fins , i recognized the dreadful squalus melanopterus from the seas of the east indies , a variety in the species of sharks proper . it was more than twenty - five feet long ; its enormous mouth occupied a third of its body . it was an adult , as could be seen from the six rows of teeth forming an isosceles triangle in its upper jaw .",22
"during the day of january 29 , the island of ceylon disappeared below the horizon , and at a speed of twenty miles per hour , the nautilus glided into the labyrinthine channels that separate the maldive and laccadive islands . it likewise hugged kiltan island , a shore of madreporic origin discovered by vasco da gama in 1499 and one of nineteen chief islands in the island group of the laccadives , located between latitude 10 degrees and 14 degrees 30 ' north , and between longitude 50 degrees 72 ' and 69 degrees east .",95
"by then the frigate lay in latitude 31 degrees 15 ' north and longitude 136 degrees 42 ' east . the shores of japan were less than 200 miles to our leeward . night was coming on . eight o'clock had just struck . huge clouds covered the moon 's disk , then in its first quarter . the sea undulated placidly beneath the frigate 's stempost .",18

"on february 9 the nautilus cruised in the widest part of the red sea , measuring 190 miles straight across from suakin on the west coast to qunfidha on the east coast .",30
"he had better have said slide , for we did nothing but drop down the steep inclines . it was the facifs _ descensus averni _ of virgil . the compass , which i consulted frequently , gave our direction as south - east with inflexible steadiness . this lava stream deviated neither to the right nor to the left .",43

"we were hardly thinking of that . stromboli ! what an effect this unexpected name produced upon my mind ! we were in the midst of the mediterranean sea , on an island of the æolian archipelago , in the ancient strongyle , where æolus kept the winds and the storms chained up , to be let loose at his will . and those distant blue mountains in the east were the mountains of calabria . and that threatening volcano far away in the south was the fierce etna .",69

"there was a full complement of passengers on board , among them english , many americans , a large number of coolies on their way to california , and several east indian officers , who were spending their vacation in making the tour of the world . nothing of moment happened on the voyage ; the steamer , sustained on its large paddles , rolled but little , and the pacific almost justified its name . mr . fogg was as calm and taciturn as ever . his young companion felt herself more and more attached to him by other ties than gratitude ; his silent but generous nature impressed her more than she thought ; and it was almost unconsciously that she yielded to emotions which did not seem to have the least effect upon her protector . aouda took the keenest interest in his plans , and became impatient at any incident which seemed likely to retard his journey .",30
"with ned and conseil , i went to sit on the platform . the coast to the east looked like a slightly blurred mass in a damp fog .",17
"suddenly daylight appeared in the lounge . the sheet - iron panels slid shut . the magical vision disappeared . but for a good while i kept dreaming away , until the moment my eyes focused on the instruments hanging on the wall . the compass still showed our heading as east - northeast , the pressure gauge indicated a pressure of five atmospheres ( corresponding to a depth of fifty meters ) , and the electric log gave our speed as fifteen miles per hour .",51
"the nautilus kept to an east - northeasterly heading , a speed of twelve miles per hour , and a depth between fifty and sixty meters .",5
"but they had in no way surveyed the woods which covered the serpentine peninsula , all to the right of the mercy , the left bank of falls river , and the wilderness of spurs and valleys which supported three quarters of the base of mount franklin , to the east , the north , and the west , and where doubtless many secret retreats existed .",50
"the journey was resumed at six in the morning ; the guide hoped to reach allahabad by evening . in that case , mr . fogg would only lose a part of the forty - eight hours saved since the beginning of the tour . kiouni , resuming his rapid gait , soon descended the lower spurs of the vindhias , and towards noon they passed by the village of kallenger , on the cani , one of the branches of the ganges . the guide avoided inhabited places , thinking it safer to keep the open country , which lies along the first depressions of the basin of the great river . allahabad was now only twelve miles to the north - east . they stopped under a clump of bananas , the fruit of which , as healthy as bread and as succulent as cream , was amply partaken of and appreciated .",123
