"lastly , she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would , in the after - time , be herself a grown woman ; and how she would keep , through all her riper years , the simple and loving heart of her childhood : and how she would gather about her other little children , and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale , perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago : and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows , and find a pleasure in all their simple joys , remembering her own child - life , and the happy summer days .",102

"as this was the height of d’artagnan ’s worldly ambition -- apart , be it well understood , from his desire of finding mme . bonacieux -- he ran , full of joy , to seek his comrades , whom he had left only half an hour before , but whom he found very sad and deeply preoccupied .",32
"there was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of influence . no other activity was like it . to project one 's soul into some gracious form , and let it tarry there for a moment ; to hear one 's own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of passion and youth ; to convey one 's temperament into another as though it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume : there was a real joy in that -- perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited and vulgar as our own , an age grossly carnal in its pleasures , and grossly common in its aims ....",89
"as for ned land , he ended our talk in his best speechifying style : "" that 's all fine and dandy . but in my humble opinion , a life in jail is a life without joy . """,37

"this prediction was but half fulfilled : i did not indeed dream of sorrow , but as little did i dream of joy ; for i never slept at all .",22
"was it really true that one could never change ? he felt a wild longing for the unstained purity of his boyhood-- his rose - white boyhood , as lord henry had once called it . he knew that he had tarnished himself , filled his mind with corruption and given horror to his fancy ; that he had been an evil influence to others , and had experienced a terrible joy in being so ; and that of the lives that had crossed his own , it had been the fairest and the most full of promise that he had brought to shame . but was it all irretrievable ? was there no hope for him ?",71
""" father , "" said candide to the friar , "" you seem to me to enjoy a state of happiness that even kings might envy ; joy and health are painted in your countenance . you have a pretty wench to divert you ; and you seem to be perfectly well contented with your condition as a theatin . """,27
"i did not care to go out of sight of the boat , fearing the coming of canoes with savages down the river ; but the boy seeing a low place about a mile up the country , rambled to it , and by - and - by i saw him come running towards me . i thought he was pursued by some savage , or frighted with some wild beast , and i ran forward towards him to help him ; but when i came nearer to him i saw something hanging over his shoulders , which was a creature that he had shot , like a hare , but different in colour , and longer legs ; however , we were very glad of it , and it was very good meat ; but the great joy that poor xury came with , was to tell me he had found good water and seen no wild mans .",138
"he felt that if he brooded on what he had gone through he would sicken or grow mad . there were sins whose fascination was more in the memory than in the doing of them , strange triumphs that gratified the pride more than the passions , and gave to the intellect a quickened sense of joy , greater than any joy they brought , or could ever bring , to the senses . but this was not one of them . it was a thing to be driven out of the mind , to be drugged with poppies , to be strangled lest it might strangle one itself .",61
i thanked god -- experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful joy -- and slept .,12
"he began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute a science that each little spring of life would be revealed to us . as it was , we always misunderstood ourselves and rarely understood others . experience was of no ethical value . it was merely the name men gave to their mistakes . moralists had , as a rule , regarded it as a mode of warning , had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation of character , had praised it as something that taught us what to follow and showed us what to avoid . but there was no motive power in experience . it was as little of an active cause as conscience itself . all that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same as our past , and that the sin we had done once , and with loathing , we would do many times , and with joy .",163
""" i telled mary how it would be , "" he said : "" i knew what mr . edward "" ( john was an old servant , and had known his master when he was the cadet of the house , therefore , he often gave him his christian name)--""i knew what mr . edward would do ; and i was certain he would not wait long neither : and he 's done right , for aught i know . i wish you joy , miss !

""" yes , we should have a full day to - day , "" he remarked , and he rubbed his hands with the joy of action .

""" i fancy i begin to see my way , "" murmured milady , with a savage joy , burying herself under the clothes to conceal from anybody who might be watching her this burst of inward satisfaction .",17
"i sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled . i forgot that i was in london and in the nineteenth century . i was away with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen . after the performance was over , i went behind and spoke to her . as we were sitting together , suddenly there came into her eyes a look that i had never seen there before . my lips moved towards hers . we kissed each other . i ca n't describe to you what i felt at that moment . it seemed to me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of rose - coloured joy . she trembled all over and shook like a white narcissus . then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands . i feel that i should not tell you all this , but i ca n't help it . of course , our engagement is a dead secret . she has not even told her own mother . i do n't know what my guardians will say . lord radley is sure to be furious . i do n't care . i shall be of age in less than a year , and then i can do what i like . i have been right , basil , have n't i , to take my love out of poetry and to find my wife in shakespeare 's plays ? lips that shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear . i have had the arms of rosalind around me , and kissed juliet on the mouth . """,117
""" it is all very well for the present , "" said he ; "" but seriously , i trust that when the first flush of vivacity is over , you will look a little higher than domestic endearments and household joys . """,41
