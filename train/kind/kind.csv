"there mr . fogg examined a curious vehicle , a kind of frame on two long beams , a little raised in front like the runners of a sledge , and upon which there was room for five or six persons . a high mast was fixed on the frame , held firmly by metallic lashings , to which was attached a large brigantine sail . this mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist a jib - sail . behind , a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle . it was , in short , a sledge rigged like a sloop . during the winter , when the trains are blocked up by the snow , these sledges make extremely rapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another . provided with more sails than a cutter , and with the wind behind them , they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not superior to that of the express trains .","('kind', 'sorte', 'especie')",1,10,1

"to judge by the distant appearance of the summit of snæfell , it would have seemed too steep to ascend on our side . fortunately , after an hour of fatigue and athletic exercises , in the midst of the vast surface of snow presented by the hollow between the two peaks , a kind of staircase appeared unexpectedly which greatly facilitated our ascent . it was formed by one of those torrents of stones flung up by the eruptions , called ' sting ' by the icelanders . if this torrent had not been arrested in its fall by the formation of the sides of the mountain , it would have gone on to the sea and formed more islands .","('kind', 'sorte', 'especie')",1,54,1

""" here , professor aronnax , are the different dimensions of this boat now transporting you . it 's a very long cylinder with conical ends . it noticeably takes the shape of a cigar , a shape already adopted in london for several projects of the same kind . the length of this cylinder from end to end is exactly seventy meters , and its maximum breadth of beam is eight meters . so it is n't quite built on the ten - to - one ratio of your high - speed steamers ; but its lines are sufficiently long , and their tapering gradual enough , so that the displaced water easily slips past and poses no obstacle to the ship 's movements .","('kind', 'genre', 'género')",0,48,0
