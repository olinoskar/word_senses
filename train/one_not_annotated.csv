"neb remarked that the year finished on a bad day , but pencroft replied that naturally the next would begin on a good one , which was better .",23
"still further , his confidence in the worthy picard , at one time so great , diminished day by day .",11
"now , while admiring , as others doubtless will admire , the details we have to relate , our main preoccupation concerned a matter to which no one before ourselves had given a thought .",27
"on the sixteenth day , in particular , these signs were so strong in d’artagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one place , and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which planchet was expected .",26
"i followed him to a headland , after he had given his instructions to the hunter . there preserved meat , biscuit , and tea made us an excellent meal , one of the best i ever remember . hunger , the fresh air , the calm quiet weather , after the commotions we had gone through , all contributed to give me a good appetite .",31
herbert much regretted that top had not been able to catch one of these carnivora .,11

"however , when a poultry - yard was established at granite house , he observed that it would be best to take some precautions against a probable visit from these four - legged plunderers , and no one disputed this .",37

"take advantage of all , and live happily and long . i have but one word to add , and that is to propose an example to you -- not mine , for i myself have never appeared at court , and have only taken part in religious wars as a volunteer ; i speak of monsieur de treville , who was formerly my neighbor , and who had the honor to be , as a child , the play - fellow of our king , louis xiii , whom god preserve !",14
"one would really say , that the western part of lincoln island , so rich and so fertile , is washed by the warm waters of the gulf of mexico , and that its shores to the north and the southeast extend over a sort of arctic sea . """,0
"afterward , monsieur de treville fought with others : in his first journey to paris , five times ; from the death of the late king till the young one came of age , without reckoning wars and sieges , seven times ; and from that date up to the present day , a hundred times , perhaps ! so that in spite of edicts , ordinances , and decrees , there he is , captain of the musketeers ; that is to say , chief of a legion of caesars , whom the king holds in great esteem and whom the cardinal dreads -- he who dreads nothing , as it is said .",29
"it was not that the sight of the wretched pony did not excite numerous smiles on the countenances of passers - by ; but as against the side of this pony rattled a sword of respectable length , and as over this sword gleamed an eye rather ferocious than haughty , these passers - by repressed their hilarity , or if hilarity prevailed over prudence , they endeavored to laugh only on one side , like the masks of the ancients .",72
"thus , at one bound , the record of the existence of man receded far back into the history of the ages past ; he was a predecessor of the mastodon ; he was a contemporary of the southern elephant ; he lived a hundred thousand years ago , when , according to geologists , the pleiocene formation was in progress .",3
"such then was the state of palæontological science , and what we knew of it was sufficient to explain our behaviour in the presence of this stupendous golgotha . any one may now understand the frenzied excitement of my uncle , when , twenty yards farther on , he found himself face to face with a primitive man !",30
"now , as at the moment in which d’artagnan fixed his eyes upon the gentleman in the violet doublet , the gentleman made one of his most knowing and profound remarks respecting the bearnese pony , his two auditors laughed even louder than before , and he himself , though contrary to his custom , allowed a pale smile ( if i may allowed to use such an expression ) to stray over his countenance .",23
"this time there could be no doubt ; d’artagnan was really insulted . full , then , of this conviction , he pulled his cap down over his eyes , and endeavoring to copy some of the court airs he had picked up in gascony among young traveling nobles , he advanced with one hand on the hilt of his sword and the other resting on his hip .",53
"i shook my head : i could not see how poor people had the means of being kind ; and then to learn to speak like them , to adopt their manners , to be uneducated , to grow up like one of the poor women i saw sometimes nursing their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the village of gateshead : no , i was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at the price of caste .",41
"this idea soon became so insupportable to her that at the risk of whatever terrible consequences might result to herself from it , she implored the captain to put her on shore ; but the captain , eager to escape from his false position -- placed between french and english cruisers , like the bat between the mice and the birds -- was in great haste to regain england , and positively refused to obey what he took for a woman ’s caprice , promising his passenger , who had been particularly recommended to him by the cardinal , to land her , if the sea and the french permitted him , at one of the ports of brittany , either at lorient or brest . but the wind was contrary , the sea bad ; they tacked and kept offshore .",113

"mrs . reed was rather a stout woman ; but , on hearing this strange and audacious declaration , she ran nimbly up the stair , swept me like a whirlwind into the nursery , and crushing me down on the edge of my crib , dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place , or utter one syllable during the remainder of the day .",60

"so strange a reception naturally gave milady ample matter for reflection ; so seeing that the young officer did not seem at all disposed for conversation , she reclined in her corner of the carriage , and one after the other passed in review all the surmises which presented themselves to her mind .",37

"in seeking to put our cargo into somewhat better order , i found that the greater part of the articles embarked had disappeared at the moment of the explosion , when the sea broke in upon us with such violence . i wanted to know exactly what we had saved , and with the lantern in my hand i began my examination . of our instruments none were saved but the compass and the chronometer ; our stock of ropes and ladders was reduced to the bit of cord rolled round the stump of the mast ! not a spade , not a pickaxe , not a hammer was left us ; and , irreparable disaster ! we had only one day 's provisions left .",120
"i searched every nook and corner , every crack and cranny in the raft . there was nothing . our provisions were reduced to one bit of salt meat and a few biscuits .",24
"yet by an inexplicable play of the imagination i forgot my present dangers , to contemplate the threatening future . was there any chance of escaping from the fury of this impetuous torrent , and of returning to the surface of the globe ? i could not form the slightest conjecture how or when . but one chance in a thousand , or ten thousand , is still a chance ; whilst death from starvation would leave us not the smallest hope in the world .",56

"what could be the meaning of such a change ? up to this time facts had supported the theories of davy and of liedenbrock ; until now particular conditions of non - conducting rocks , electricity and magnetism , had tempered the laws of nature , giving us only a moderately warm climate , for the theory of a central fire remained in my estimation the only one that was true and explicable . were we then turning back to where the phenomena of central heat ruled in all their rigour and would reduce the most refractory rocks to the state of a molten liquid ? i feared this , and said to the professor :",67
"several times , one or other of the settlers descended to the beach in the midst of ice which the waves heaped up at each tide , but they soon climbed up again to granite house , and it was not without pain and difficulty that their hands could hold to the rounds of the ladder .",3

"thanks to this double gift and the spotless name that accompanied it , m. de treville was admitted into the household of the young prince where he made such good use of his sword , and was so faithful to his motto , that louis xiii , one of the good blades of his kingdom , was accustomed to say that if he had a friend who was about to fight , he would advise him to choose as a second , himself first , and treville next -- or even , perhaps , before himself .",47
"my uncle took the piece of meat and the few biscuits which had escaped from the general destruction . he divided them into three equal portions and gave one to each . this made about a pound of nourishment for each . the professor ate his greedily , with a kind of feverish rage . i ate without pleasure , almost with disgust ; hans quietly , moderately , masticating his small mouthfuls without any noise , and relishing them with the calmness of a man above all anxiety about the future . by diligent search he had found a flask of hollands ; he offered it to us each in turn , and this generous beverage cheered us up slightly .",28

"for the rest , in the memoirs of this period , which has left so many memoirs , one does not find this worthy gentleman blamed even by his enemies ; and he had many such among men of the pen as well as among men of the sword . in no instance , let us say , was this worthy gentleman accused of deriving personal advantage from the cooperation of his minions .",18

"sailors ' luck led the nautilus straight to reao island , one of the most unusual in this group , which was discovered in 1822 by captain bell aboard the minerva . so i was able to study the madreporic process that has created the islands in this ocean .",11
"madrepores , which one must guard against confusing with precious coral , clothe their tissue in a limestone crust , and their variations in structure have led my famous mentor professor milne - edwards to classify them into five divisions . the tiny microscopic animals that secrete this polypary live by the billions in the depths of their cells . their limestone deposits build up into rocks , reefs , islets , islands . in some places , they form atolls , a circular ring surrounding a lagoon or small inner lake that gaps place in contact with the sea . elsewhere , they take the shape of barrier reefs , such as those that exist along the coasts of new caledonia and several of the tuamotu islands . in still other localities , such as réunion island and the island of mauritius , they build fringing reefs , high , straight walls next to which the ocean 's depth is considerable .",3
"while cruising along only a few cable lengths from the underpinning of reao island , i marveled at the gigantic piece of work accomplished by these microscopic laborers . these walls were the express achievements of madrepores known by the names fire coral , finger coral , star coral , and stony coral . these polyps grow exclusively in the agitated strata at the surface of the sea , and so it 's in the upper reaches that they begin these substructures , which sink little by little together with the secreted rubble binding them . this , at least , is the theory of mr . charles darwin , who thus explains the formation of atolls -- a theory superior , in my view , to the one that says these madreporic edifices sit on the summits of mountains or volcanoes submerged a few feet below sea level .",128

"when the nautilus returned to the surface of the ocean , i could take in reao island over its whole flat , wooded expanse . obviously its madreporic rocks had been made fertile by tornadoes and thunderstorms . one day , carried off by a hurricane from neighboring shores , some seed fell onto these limestone beds , mixing with decomposed particles of fish and marine plants to form vegetable humus . propelled by the waves , a coconut arrived on this new coast . its germ took root . its tree grew tall , catching steam off the water . a brook was born . little by little , vegetation spread . tiny animals -- worms , insects -- rode ashore on tree trunks snatched from islands to windward . turtles came to lay their eggs . birds nested in the young trees . in this way animal life developed , and drawn by the greenery and fertile soil , man appeared . and that 's how these islands were formed , the immense achievement of microscopic animals .",38

"suddenly she came upon a little three - legged table , all made of solid glass ; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key , and alice 's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall ; but , alas ! either the locks were too large , or the key was too small , but at any rate it would not open any of them . however , on the second time round , she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before , and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high : she tried the little golden key in the lock , and to her great delight it fitted !",39
"after a while , finding that nothing more happened , she decided on going into the garden at once ; but , alas for poor alice ! when she got to the door , she found she had forgotten the little golden key , and when she went back to the table for it , she found she could not possibly reach it : she could see it quite plainly through the glass , and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table , but it was too slippery ; and when she had tired herself out with trying , the poor little thing sat down and cried .",82
