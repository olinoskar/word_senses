"i opened the glass - door in the breakfast - room : the shrubbery was quite still : the black frost reigned , unbroken by sun or breeze , through the grounds .",3
"there were some difficulties to be encountered ; but , after several fruitless attempts , he succeeded in setting up a glass manufactory , which gideon spilett and herbert , his usual assistants , did not leave for several days .",21
"as to the substances used in the composition of glass , they are simply sand , chalk , and soda , either carbonate or sulphate .",9
"the tool , the manufacture of which presented the most difficulty , was the pipe of the glass - maker , an iron tube , five or six feet long , which collects on one end the material in a state of fusion .",17
"the hall - door , which was half of glass , stood open ; i stepped over the threshold .",9
""" listen , then , jane eyre , to your sentence : to - morrow , place the glass before you , and draw in chalk your own picture , faithfully , without softening one defect ; omit no harsh line , smooth away no displeasing irregularity ; write under it , ' portrait of a governess , disconnected , poor , and plain .

""" is glass capable of resisting such pressures ? """,2
"thousands of threads like glass , formed of fluid lava , fell like rain upon the island .",4
"it was a cabin measuring six feet square and closely resembling those occupied by the helmsmen of steamboats on the mississippi or hudson rivers . in the center stood an upright wheel geared to rudder cables running to the nautilus 's stern . set in the cabin 's walls were four deadlights , windows of biconvex glass that enabled the man at the helm to see in every direction .",56
"near the middle of the platform , the skiff was half set in the ship 's hull , making a slight bulge . fore and aft stood two cupolas of moderate height , their sides slanting and partly inset with heavy biconvex glass , one reserved for the helmsman steering the nautilus , the other for the brilliance of the powerful electric beacon lighting his way .",42
"most of the books were locked up behind glass doors ; but there was one bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way of elementary works , and several volumes of light literature , poetry , biography , travels , a few romances , & c.",8
"just then i was in the bow , leaning over the starboard rail . conseil , stationed beside me , stared straight ahead . roosting in the shrouds , the crew examined the horizon , which shrank and darkened little by little . officers were probing the increasing gloom with their night glasses . sometimes the murky ocean sparkled beneath moonbeams that darted between the fringes of two clouds . then all traces of light vanished into the darkness .",52
"suddenly , through two oblong openings , daylight appeared on both sides of the lounge . the liquid masses came into view , brightly lit by the ship 's electric outpourings . we were separated from the sea by two panes of glass . initially i shuddered at the thought that these fragile partitions could break ; but strong copper bands secured them , giving them nearly infinite resistance .",42
"if we accept the hypotheses of the microbiologist ehrenberg-- who believes that these underwater depths are lit up by phosphorescent organisms -- nature has certainly saved one of her most prodigious sights for residents of the sea , and i could judge for myself from the thousandfold play of the light . on both sides i had windows opening over these unexplored depths . the darkness in the lounge enhanced the brightness outside , and we stared as if this clear glass were the window of an immense aquarium .",81
"the examination was easy , and ayrton soon let the glass fall again , saying--",10
"i approached him with the now only half - filled glass ; pilot followed me , still excited .",10
"i spilt half of what was in the glass , "" i said .",8
""" all right , conseil my friend , "" the harpooner said , leaning toward the glass panel , "" here come a couple of your varieties now ! """,16
""" had you a burning - glass , sir ? "" asked herbert of harding .",6
"suspicion instantly seized me . i paused , but i had already drunk half a glass .",15
and he showed the apparatus which served for a burning - glass .,11
"having filled them with water and rendered their edges adhesive by means of a little clay , he thus fabricated a regular burning - glass , which , concentrating the solar rays on some very dry moss , soon caused it to blaze .",24
"milady made her a sign to sit down opposite , poured her a small glass of spanish wine , and helped her to the wing of a chicken .",14
"i took one last look at the natural wonders and artistic treasures amassed in the museum , this unrivaled collection doomed to perish someday in the depths of the seas , together with its curator . i wanted to establish one supreme impression in my mind . i stayed there an hour , basking in the aura of the ceiling lights , passing in review the treasures shining in their glass cases . then i returned to my stateroom . there i dressed in sturdy seafaring clothes . i gathered my notes and packed them tenderly about my person . my heart was pounding mightily . i could n't curb its pulsations . my anxiety and agitation would certainly have given me away if captain nemo had seen me .",70
""" with the ruhmkorff device , professor aronnax . if the first is carried on the back , the second is fastened to the belt . it consists of a bunsen battery that i activate not with potassium dichromate but with sodium . an induction coil gathers the electricity generated and directs it to a specially designed lantern . in this lantern one finds a glass spiral that contains only a residue of carbon dioxide gas . when the device is operating , this gas becomes luminous and gives off a continuous whitish light . thus provided for , i breathe and i see . """,65
"but as the bushes shrank , the tree forms magnified . actual petrified thickets and long alcoves from some fantastic school of architecture kept opening up before our steps . captain nemo entered beneath a dark gallery whose gentle slope took us to a depth of 100 meters . the light from our glass coils produced magical effects at times , lingering on the wrinkled roughness of some natural arch , or some overhang suspended like a chandelier , which our lamps flecked with fiery sparks . amid these shrubs of precious coral , i observed other polyps no less unusual : melita coral , rainbow coral with jointed outgrowths , then a few tufts of genus corallina , some green and others red , actually a type of seaweed encrusted with limestone salts , which , after long disputes , naturalists have finally placed in the vegetable kingdom . but as one intellectual has remarked , "" here , perhaps , is the actual point where life rises humbly out of slumbering stone , but without breaking away from its crude starting point .

"the engineer corked them by means of a stopper through which passed a glass tube , bored at its lower extremity , and intended to be plunged into the acid by means of a clay stopper secured by a rag .",13
"on the 6th of february was commenced the planting along the road to the corral , of posts furnished with glass insulators , and intended to support the wire .",20
"folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand ; to the left were the clear panes of glass , protecting , but not separating me from the drear november day .",21
"a few strange , antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated the stained walls ; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and an ancient set of china .",22
"captain nemo inserted his cranium into its spherical headgear . conseil and i did the same , but not without hearing the canadian toss us a sarcastic "" happy hunting . "" on top , the suit ended in a collar of threaded copper onto which the metal helmet was screwed . three holes , protected by heavy glass , allowed us to see in any direction with simply a turn of the head inside the sphere . placed on our backs , the rouquayrol device went into operation as soon as it was in position , and for my part , i could breathe with ease .",58
"this apparatus , provided with a powerful object - glass , was very complete .",9
"i say 150 meters , although i had no instruments for estimating this distance . but i knew that the sun 's rays , even in the clearest seas , could reach no deeper . so at precisely this point the darkness became profound . not a single object was visible past ten paces . consequently , i had begun to grope my way when suddenly i saw the glow of an intense white light . captain nemo had just activated his electric device . his companion did likewise . conseil and i followed suit . by turning a switch , i established contact between the induction coil and the glass spiral , and the sea , lit up by our four lanterns , was illuminated for a radius of twenty - five meters .",110
of course they did ; for i felt their eyes directed like burning - glasses against my scorched skin .,14
"during the night , in line with my forecasts , a new one - meter slice was removed from this immense socket . but in the morning , wearing my diving suit , i was crossing through the liquid mass in a temperature of -6 degrees to -7 degrees centigrade , when i noted that little by little the side walls were closing in on each other . the liquid strata farthest from the trench , not warmed by the movements of workmen and tools , were showing a tendency to solidify . in the face of this imminent new danger , what would happen to our chances for salvation , and how could we prevent this liquid medium from solidifying , then cracking the nautilus 's hull like glass ?",129
"returning , i had to cross before the looking- glass ; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed .",9
"it was during the night of december 9 - 10 that the nautilus encountered this army of distinctly nocturnal mollusks . they numbered in the millions . they were migrating from the temperate zones toward zones still warmer , following the itineraries of herring and sardines . we stared at them through our thick glass windows : they swam backward with tremendous speed , moving by means of their locomotive tubes , chasing fish and mollusks , eating the little ones , eaten by the big ones , and tossing in indescribable confusion the ten feet that nature has rooted in their heads like a hairpiece of pneumatic snakes . despite its speed , the nautilus navigated for several hours in the midst of this school of animals , and its nets brought up an incalculable number , among which i recognized all nine species that professor orbigny has classified as native to the pacific ocean .",54
""" ah , monsieur , "" said planchet , "" i saw one fall at each of his two shots , and he appeared to me , through the glass door , to be fighting with his sword with the others . """,29
"d’artagnan was lifting a glass to his lips ; but at the name of milady , his hand trembled so , that he was obliged to put the glass on the ground again for fear of spilling the contents . """,28
""" abominable , ned my friend , "" conseil replied . "" but when a little glass of vinegar is worth 1,500,000 francs , its taste is a small price to pay . """,16
""" this one ? "" conseil said , pointing to a magnificent jewel in its glass case .",15
"the old woman 's voice had changed : her accent , her gesture , and all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass -- as the speech of my own tongue . i got up , but did not go .",26
"i then understood captain nemo 's intent . by leaving the pearl buried beneath the giant clam 's mantle , he allowed it to grow imperceptibly . with each passing year the mollusk 's secretions added new concentric layers . the captain alone was familiar with the cave where this wonderful fruit of nature was "" ripening "" ; he alone reared it , so to speak , in order to transfer it one day to his dearly beloved museum . perhaps , following the examples of oyster farmers in china and india , he had even predetermined the creation of this pearl by sticking under the mollusk 's folds some piece of glass or metal that was gradually covered with mother - of - pearl . in any case , comparing this pearl to others i already knew about , and to those shimmering in the captain 's collection , i estimated that it was worth at least 10,000,000 francs . it was a superb natural curiosity rather than a luxurious piece of jewelry , because i do n't know of any female ear that could handle it .",113
"i then entered a dining room , decorated and furnished in austere good taste . inlaid with ebony trim , tall oaken sideboards stood at both ends of this room , and sparkling on their shelves were staggered rows of earthenware , porcelain , and glass of incalculable value . there silver - plated dinnerware gleamed under rays pouring from light fixtures in the ceiling , whose glare was softened and tempered by delicately painted designs .",45
"around this basin , inside elegant glass cases fastened with copper bands , there were classified and labeled the most valuable marine exhibits ever put before the eyes of a naturalist . my professorial glee may easily be imagined .",6
"no ; for marine plants abounded on the shore , glass - wort , ficoides , and all those fucaceae which form wrack .",10
""" sir , "" captain nemo said , showing me the instruments hanging on the walls of his stateroom , "" these are the devices needed to navigate the nautilus . here , as in the lounge , i always have them before my eyes , and they indicate my position and exact heading in the midst of the ocean . you 're familiar with some of them , such as the thermometer , which gives the temperature inside the nautilus ; the barometer , which measures the heaviness of the outside air and forecasts changes in the weather ; the humidistat , which indicates the degree of dryness in the atmosphere ; the storm glass , whose mixture decomposes to foretell the arrival of tempests ; the compass , which steers my course ; the sextant , which takes the sun 's altitude and tells me my latitude ; chronometers , which allow me to calculate my longitude ; and finally , spyglasses for both day and night , enabling me to scrutinize every point of the horizon once the nautilus has risen to the surface of the waves . """,115
"this was because his love , so strange , so new , and so ardent , made him view the infamous and imaginary accusations of milady de winter as , through a magnifying glass , one views as frightful monsters atoms in reality imperceptible by the side of an ant .",33
"but he had scarcely looked at it , when he uttered a cry , and the glass almost fell from his hands .",16
