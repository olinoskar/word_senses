"the lad started and drew back . he was bareheaded , and the leaves had tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads . there was a look of fear in his eyes , such as people have when they are suddenly awakened . his finely chiselled nostrils quivered , and some hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling .",1,"('lad', 'adolescent', 'muchacho')",2

"lord henry had not yet come in . he was always late on principle , his principle being that punctuality is the thief of time . so the lad was looking rather sulky , as with listless fingers he turned over the pages of an elaborately illustrated edition of manon lescaut that he had found in one of the book - cases . the formal monotonous ticking of the louis quatorze clock annoyed him . once or twice he thought of going away .",28,"('lad', 'adolescent', 'muchacho')",2
