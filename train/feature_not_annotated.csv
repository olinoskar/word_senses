""" it is difficult to say , "" replied the reporter , "" for it is impossible to see his features under the thick beard which covers his face , but he is no longer young , and i suppose he might be about fifty . """,20
"in fact , in addition to that yellow , sickly paleness which indicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood , and which might , besides , be accidental , d’artagnan remarked something perfidiously significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his countenance .",42
""" then let us go and look at the room . "" with which inconsequent remark he strode on into the house , followed by gregson , whose features expressed his astonishment .",28
a wild look raised his brows -- crossed his features : he rose ; but he forebore yet .,9
"i had indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles could inflict ; and when i saw that either that or my look daunted him , i had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to purpose ; but he was already with his mama . i heard him in a blubbering tone commence the tale of how "" that nasty jane eyre "" had flown at him like a mad cat : he was stopped rather harshly--",7
"both her cast of form and feature , her complexion and her general air , suggested the idea of some israelitish princess of the patriarchal days ; and such was doubtless the character she intended to represent .",6
"we had been left to ourselves for twenty minutes , trying to detect the tiniest noises inside the nautilus , when captain nemo entered . he did n't seem to see us . his facial features , usually so emotionless , revealed a certain uneasiness . he studied the compass and pressure gauge in silence , then went and put his finger on the world map at a spot in the sector depicting the southernmost seas .",35
""" what then , die ? "" he replied , maintaining a marble immobility of feature .",15
"rance gave a violent jump , and stared at sherlock holmes with the utmost amazement upon his features .",17
"pretty , mysterious , initiated in almost all the secrets of the court , which reflected such a charming gravity over her pleasing features , it might be surmised that she was not wholly unmoved ; and this is an irresistible charm to novices in love . moreover , d’artagnan had delivered her from the hands of the demons who wished to search and ill treat her ; and this important service had established between them one of those sentiments of gratitude which so easily assume a more tender character .",23
"it was an insane idea . fortunately i controlled myself and stretched out on the bed to soothe my bodily agitation . my nerves calmed a little , but with my brain so aroused , i did a swift review of my whole existence aboard the nautilus , every pleasant or unpleasant incident that had crossed my path since i went overboard from the abraham lincoln : the underwater hunting trip , the torres strait , our running aground , the savages of papua , the coral cemetery , the suez passageway , the island of santorini , the cretan diver , the bay of vigo , atlantis , the ice bank , the south pole , our imprisonment in the ice , the battle with the devilfish , the storm in the gulf stream , the avenger , and that horrible scene of the vessel sinking with its crew . . . ! all these events passed before my eyes like backdrops unrolling upstage in a theater . in this strange setting captain nemo then grew fantastically . his features were accentuated , taking on superhuman proportions . he was no longer my equal , he was the man of the waters , the spirit of the seas .",180
"sitting on a low stool , a few yards from her arm - chair , i examined her figure ; i perused her features .",23
"i could clearly see the shore , which featured a few sparse trees here and there .",8
i had wakened the glow : his features beamed .,7
"i looked upon the scene before me — upon the mere house , and the simple landscape features of the domain — upon the bleak walls — upon the vacant eye - like windows — upon a few rank sedges — and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees — with an utter depression of soul which i can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after - dream of the reveller upon opium — the bitter lapse into every - day life — the hideous dropping off of the veil .",17
""" yes ; there is a point which i wish to ascertain . it is merely a matter of time . hullo ! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance ! here is gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every feature of his face . bound for us , i know . yes , he is stopping . there he is ! """,47
its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity .,2
"before more carefully examining the interior features of this enormous cavern , and before deciding if it was the work of nature or humankind , i went over to captain nemo .",6
""" possibly ; but that is not the question . do you think , consul , that this phlegmatic gentleman resembles , feature by feature , the robber whose description i have received ? """,22
""" a terrible change came over the woman 's face as i asked the question . her features turned perfectly livid . it was some seconds before she could get out the single word ' yes'—and when it did come it was in a husky unnatural tone .",17
"i learned , moreover , at intervals , and through broken and equivocal hints , another singular feature of his mental condition .",17
"his noble features , paled by the approach of death , were perfectly calm .",2
"i sought in her countenance and features a likeness to mr . rochester , but found none : no trait , no turn of expression announced relationship .",6
that feature too is propitious .,1
""" all this seems strange to you , "" continued holmes , "" because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you . i had the good fortune to seize upon that , and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition , and , indeed , was the logical sequence of it . hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure , have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions . it is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery . the most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn . this murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those outré and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable . these strange details , far from making the case more difficult , have really had the effect of making it less so . """,123
"the poor fellow really felt sad when -- melancholy reminiscence of his youth!--he donned his costume , adorned with vari - coloured wings , and fastened to his natural feature a false nose six feet long . but he cheered up when he thought that this nose was winning him something to eat .",29
"i looked at my pupil , who did not at first appear to notice me : she was quite a child , perhaps seven or eight years old , slightly built , with a pale , small - featured face , and a redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist .",38
"calm of eye , cool of feature , an old gray - bearded gunner-- i can see him to this day -- approached the cannon , put it in position , and took aim for a good while . there was a mighty explosion , mingled with cheers from the crew .",6
"the journey was a swift and pleasant one , and i spent it in making the more intimate acquaintance of my two companions and in playing with dr . mortimer 's spaniel . in a very few hours the brown earth had become ruddy , the brick had changed to granite , and red cows grazed in well - hedged fields where the lush grasses and more luxuriant vegetation spoke of a richer , if a damper , climate . young baskerville stared eagerly out of the window , and cried aloud with delight as he recognized the familiar features of the devon scenery .",99
"with a little more heart , he might have been contented with this new conquest ; but the principal features of his character were ambition and pride .",19
"and now , some days of bitter grief having elapsed , an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend .",17
"i saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed about him . the light beat upon him where he stood , but long shadows trailed down the walls and hung like a black canopy above him . barrymore had returned from taking our luggage to our rooms . he stood in front of us now with the subdued manner of a well - trained servant . he was a remarkable - looking man , tall , handsome , with a square black beard and pale , distinguished features .",92
"i recognised well that purple face,--those bloated features .",7
""" we must ask about this right away . "" he rang the bell and asked barrymore whether he could account for our experience . it seemed to me that the pallid features of the butler turned a shade paler still as he listened to his master 's question .",32
"they belong to that species of molluscous perforators which excavate holes in the hardest stone ; their shell is rounded at both ends , a feature which is not remarked in the common mussel .",25
"no feature in the scene was extraordinary , but all was pleasing .",1
"and d’artagnan gave , feature for feature , a description of the comte de wardes .",4
"the exploration of the island was finished , its shape determined , its features made out , its extent calculated , the water and mountain systems ascertained .",13
"i spun around . captain nemo was standing before me , but i almost did n't recognize him . his facial features were transfigured . gleaming with dark fire , his eyes had shrunk beneath his frowning brow . his teeth were half bared . his rigid body , clenched fists , and head drawn between his shoulders , all attested to a fierce hate breathing from every pore . he did n't move . my spyglass fell from his hand and rolled at his feet .",21
"his face was very much agitated and very much flushed , and there were strong workings in the features , and strange gleams in the eyes .",18
"anyone consulting conseil would soon learn from the gallant lad that the branch mollusca is divided into five classes ; that the first class features the cephalopoda ( whose members are sometimes naked , sometimes covered with a shell ) , which consists of two families , the dibranchiata and the tetrabranchiata , which are distinguished by their number of gills ; that the family dibranchiata includes three genera , the argonaut , the squid , and the cuttlefish , and that the family tetrabranchiata contains only one genus , the nautilus . after this catalog , if some recalcitrant listener confuses the argonaut , which is acetabuliferous ( in other words , a bearer of suction tubes ) , with the nautilus , which is tentaculiferous ( a bearer of tentacles ) , it will be simply unforgivable .",24
"all is still : he again advances : he bends above her ; a light veil rests on her features : he lifts it , bends lower ; now his eyes anticipate the vision of beauty -- warm , and blooming , and lovely , in rest .",19
"near two o'clock i was busy organizing my notes in the lounge , when the captain opened the door and appeared . i bowed to him . he gave me an almost imperceptible bow in return , without saying a word to me . i resumed my work , hoping he might give me some explanation of the previous afternoon 's events . he did nothing of the sort . i stared at him . his face looked exhausted ; his reddened eyes had n't been refreshed by sleep ; his facial features expressed profound sadness , real chagrin . he walked up and down , sat and stood , picked up a book at random , discarded it immediately , consulted his instruments without taking his customary notes , and seemed unable to rest easy for an instant .",92
"mary 's countenance was equally intelligent -- her features equally pretty ; but her expression was more reserved , and her manners , though gentle , more distant .",8
""" he gazed at me with bleared , drunken eyes for a moment , and then i saw a horror spring up in them , and convulse his whole features , which showed me that he knew me . he staggered back with a livid face , and i saw the perspiration break out upon his brow , while his teeth chattered in his head . at the sight , i leaned my back against the door and laughed loud and long . i had always known that vengeance would be sweet , but i had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me .",29
""" besides , captain , "" i added with still greater enthusiasm , "" why would n't we find open sea at the south pole just as at the north pole ? the cold - temperature poles and the geographical poles do n't coincide in either the northern or southern hemispheres , and until proof to the contrary , we can assume these two spots on the earth feature either a continent or an ice - free ocean . """,68
"her face was like her mother 's ; a youthful unfurrowed likeness : the same low brow , the same high features , the same pride . it was not , however , so saturnine a pride ! she laughed continually ; her laugh was satirical , and so was the habitual expression of her arched and haughty lip .",21
"i had no sympathy in their appearance , their expression : yet i could imagine that most observers would call them attractive , handsome , imposing ; while they would pronounce mr . rochester at once harsh - featured and melancholy - looking .",38
"i saw mr . rochester smile:--his stern features softened ; his eye grew both brilliant and gentle , its ray both searching and sweet .",7
"but it was in the air that life was superabundant . there various species of birds flew and fluttered by the thousands , deafening us with their calls . crowding the rocks , other fowl watched without fear as we passed and pressed familiarly against our feet . these were auks , as agile and supple in water , where they are sometimes mistaken for fast bonito , as they are clumsy and heavy on land . they uttered outlandish calls and participated in numerous public assemblies that featured much noise but little action .",88
and something like a faint smile lighted the still - terrified features of the young woman .,11
"as for our neglect , our isolation in the depths of this cell , i was afraid to guess at how long it might last . little by little , hopes i had entertained after our interview with the ship 's commander were fading away . the gentleness of the man 's gaze , the generosity expressed in his facial features , the nobility of his bearing , all vanished from my memory . i saw this mystifying individual anew for what he inevitably must be : cruel and merciless . i viewed him as outside humanity , beyond all feelings of compassion , the implacable foe of his fellow man , toward whom he must have sworn an undying hate !",60
