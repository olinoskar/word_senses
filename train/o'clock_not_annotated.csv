"this accident happened around five o'clock in the morning , just as day was beginning to break . the officers on watch rushed to the craft 's stern . they examined the ocean with the most scrupulous care . they saw nothing except a strong eddy breaking three cable lengths out , as if those sheets of water had been violently churned . the site 's exact bearings were taken , and the moravian continued on course apparently undamaged . had it run afoul of an underwater rock or the wreckage of some enormous derelict ship ? they were unable to say . but when they examined its undersides in the service yard , they discovered that part of its keel had been smashed .",5

"indeed , despite its efforts , despite the powerful methods it used to split this ice , the nautilus was reduced to immobility . ordinarily , when someone ca n't go any farther , he still has the option of returning in his tracks . but here it was just as impossible to turn back as to go forward , because every passageway had closed behind us , and if our submersible remained even slightly stationary , it would be frozen in without delay . which is exactly what happened near two o'clock in the afternoon , and fresh ice kept forming over the ship 's sides with astonishing speed . i had to admit that captain nemo 's leadership had been most injudicious .",92

"meanwhile preparations for this daring attempt were getting under way . the nautilus 's powerful pumps forced air down into the tanks and stored it under high pressure . near four o'clock captain nemo informed me that the platform hatches were about to be closed . i took a last look at the dense ice bank we were going to conquer . the weather was fair , the skies reasonably clear , the cold quite brisk , namely -12 degrees centigrade ; but after the wind had lulled , this temperature did n't seem too unbearable .",31
"but by continuing in this direction she must soon disappear behind claw cape , as the wind was from the southwest , and to watch her it would be then necessary to ascend the height of washington bay , near port balloon -- a provoking circumstance , for it was already five o'clock in the evening , and the twilight would soon make any observation extremely difficult .",52

"by then it was eight o'clock . the air inside the nautilus should have been renewed four hours earlier , following daily practice on board . but i did n't suffer very much , although captain nemo had n't yet made demands on the supplementary oxygen in his air tanks .",5
"that night my sleep was fitful . hope and fear besieged me by turns . i got up several times . the nautilus continued groping . near three o'clock in the morning , i observed that we encountered the ice bank 's underbelly at a depth of only fifty meters . so only 150 feet separated us from the surface of the water . little by little the ice bank was turning into an ice field again . the mountains were changing back into plains .",28

"at eleven o'clock the rangoon rode out of singapore harbour , and in a few hours the high mountains of malacca , with their forests , inhabited by the most beautifully - furred tigers in the world , were lost to view . singapore is distant some thirteen hundred miles from the island of hong kong , which is a little english colony near the chinese coast . phileas fogg hoped to accomplish the journey in six days , so as to be in time for the steamer which would leave on the 6th of november for yokohama , the principal japanese port .",2

"after examining this community of walruses , i decided to return in my tracks . it was eleven o'clock , and if captain nemo found conditions favorable for taking his sights , i wanted to be present at the operation . but i held no hopes that the sun would make an appearance that day . it was hidden from our eyes by clouds squeezed together on the horizon . apparently the jealous orb did n't want to reveal this inaccessible spot on the globe to any human being .",18
"three hours later , still treading on the colourless grass of the pasture land , we had to work round the kolla fiord , a longer way but an easier one than across that inlet . we soon entered into a ' pingstaoer ' or parish called ejulberg , from whose steeple twelve o'clock would have struck , if icelandic churches were rich enough to possess clocks . but they are like the parishioners who have no watches and do without .",53

"at one o'clock the rangoon was at the quay , and the passengers were going ashore .",2
"by nine o'clock we had pulled up to shore . the sky was growing brighter . clouds were fleeing to the south . mists were rising from the cold surface of the water . captain nemo headed toward the peak , which he no doubt planned to make his observatory . it was an arduous climb over sharp lava and pumice stones in the midst of air often reeking with sulfurous fumes from the smoke holes . for a man out of practice at treading land , the captain scaled the steepest slopes with a supple agility i could n't equal , and which would have been envied by hunters of pyrenees mountain goats .",2
"the next day , march 22 , at six o'clock in the morning , preparations for departure began . the last gleams of twilight were melting into night . the cold was brisk . the constellations were glittering with startling intensity . the wonderful southern cross , polar star of the antarctic regions , twinkled at its zenith .",9
"at three o'clock in the morning , i was awakened by a violent collision . i sat up in bed , listening in the darkness , and then was suddenly hurled into the middle of my stateroom . apparently the nautilus had gone aground , then heeled over sharply .",2

"the storm of rain and wind descended upon them towards eight o'clock . with but its bit of sail , the tankadere was lifted like a feather by a wind , an idea of whose violence can scarcely be given . to compare her speed to four times that of a locomotive going on full steam would be below the truth .",11
"all on board feared that it could not be done , and every one -- phileas fogg , no doubt , excepted -- felt his heart beat with impatience . the boat must keep up an average of nine miles an hour , and the wind was becoming calmer every moment ! it was a capricious breeze , coming from the coast , and after it passed the sea became smooth . still , the tankadere was so light , and her fine sails caught the fickle zephyrs so well , that , with the aid of the currents john bunsby found himself at six o'clock not more than ten miles from the mouth of shanghai river . shanghai itself is situated at least twelve miles up the stream . at seven they were still three miles from shanghai . the pilot swore an angry oath ; the reward of two hundred pounds was evidently on the point of escaping him . he looked at mr . fogg . mr . fogg was perfectly tranquil ; and yet his whole fortune was at this moment at stake .",105

"both were free from the fear of pursuit ; nobody ever came into milady ’s apartment before nine o’clock , and it would require three hours to go from the castle to london .",18
"planchet mounted by the window and installed himself across the doorway , while grimaud went and shut himself up in the stable , undertaking that by five o’clock in the morning he and the four horses should be ready .",27
"the night was quiet enough . toward two o’clock in the morning somebody endeavored to open the door ; but as planchet awoke in an instant and cried , "" who goes there ? "" somebody replied that he was mistaken , and went away .",8
he entered portsmouth about eight o’clock in the morning . the whole population was on foot ; drums were beating in the streets and in the port ; the troops about to embark were marching toward the sea .,5
"before three o'clock the large shed was invaded by the spectators , comprising europeans and natives , chinese and japanese , men , women and children , who precipitated themselves upon the narrow benches and into the boxes opposite the stage . the musicians took up a position inside , and were vigorously performing on their gongs , tam - tams , flutes , bones , tambourines , and immense drums .",2
"in fact , the moment when this shadow would reach its minimum of length would be exactly twelve o'clock , and it would be enough to watch the extremity of the shadow , so as to ascertain the instant when , after having successively diminished , it began to lengthen .",18
""" i have performed that same distance in forty hours , and by ten o’clock in the morning i must be in london . """,14
"still it was not late ; he often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock , and it was yet but six . surely i should not be wholly disappointed to - night , when i had so many things to say to him !",15
"in consequence , after having traveled all night , at seven o’clock she was at the fort of the point ; at eight o’clock she had embarked ; and at nine , the vessel , which with letters of marque from the cardinal was supposed to be sailing for bayonne , raised anchor , and steered its course toward england .",23
"the train entered the state of nevada through the carson valley about nine o'clock , going always northeasterly ; and at midday reached reno , where there was a delay of twenty minutes for breakfast .",13
"it was eight o'clock when the train passed through the defiles of the humboldt range , and half - past nine when it penetrated utah , the region of the great salt lake , the singular colony of the mormons .",3
"passepartout approached and read one of these notices , which stated that elder william hitch , mormon missionary , taking advantage of his presence on train no . 48 , would deliver a lecture on mormonism in car no . 117 , from eleven to twelve o'clock ; and that he invited all who were desirous of being instructed concerning the mysteries of the religion of the "" latter day saints "" to attend .",46
"at five o'clock in the evening , cyrus harding gave the signal to halt .",2
"they arrived at the drinking room of the parpaillot . it was seven o’clock in the morning , and daylight began to appear . the three friends ordered breakfast , and went into a room in which the host said they would not be disturbed .",13
it was therefore past ten o'clock when the engineer and his companion reached the crest of the enormous mass of rocks of basalt and porphyry which composed the northwest coast of the island .,5
"but as he did not think of giving this order till five hours after the event -- that is to say , till two o’clock in the afternoon -- two vessels had already left the port , the one bearing , as we know , milady , who , already anticipating the event , was further confirmed in that belief by seeing the black flag flying at the masthead of the admiral ’s ship .",24
""" six o’clock . """,2
"near one o'clock , captain nemo gave the signal to halt . speaking for myself , i was glad to oblige , and we stretched out beneath an arbor of winged kelp , whose long thin tendrils stood up like arrows .",2
"the seafloor kept sinking , and its significantly steeper slope took us to greater depths . it must have been nearly three o'clock when we reached a narrow valley gouged between high , vertical walls and located 150 meters down . thanks to the perfection of our equipment , we had thus gone ninety meters below the limit that nature had , until then , set on man 's underwater excursions .",22
"finally , at around four o'clock , this marvelous excursion came to an end . a wall of superb rocks stood before us , imposing in its sheer mass : a pile of gigantic stone blocks , an enormous granite cliffside pitted with dark caves but not offering a single gradient we could climb up . this was the underpinning of crespo island . this was land .",5
"the wind was blowing from the southwest , initially a stiff breeze , in other words , with a speed of fifteen meters per second , which built to twenty - five meters near three o'clock in the afternoon . this is the figure for major storms .",35
"on the evening of the day after the arrest of poor bonacieux , as athos had just left d’artagnan to report at m. de treville ’s , as nine o’clock had just struck , and as planchet , who had not yet made the bed , was beginning his task , a knocking was heard at the street door . the door was instantly opened and shut ; someone was taken in the mousetrap .",29
"still further , athos obtained of m. de treville six days instead of four , and introduced into these six days two more nights -- for they set out on the twenty - fourth at five o’clock in the evening , and as a further kindness m. de treville post - dated the leave to the morning of the twenty - fifth .",36
"at ten o'clock in the evening , the skies caught on fire . the air was streaked with violent flashes of lightning . i could n't stand this brightness , but captain nemo stared straight at it , as if to inhale the spirit of the storm . a dreadful noise filled the air , a complicated noise made up of the roar of crashing breakers , the howl of the wind , claps of thunder . the wind shifted to every point of the horizon , and the cyclone left the east to return there after passing through north , west , and south , moving in the opposite direction of revolving storms in the southern hemisphere .",2
it was now five o'clock in the evening .,4
"at eleven o'clock the locomotive 's whistle announced that they were approaching plum creek station . mr . fogg rose , and , followed by fix , went out upon the platform . passepartout accompanied him , carrying a pair of revolvers . aouda remained in the car , as pale as death .",2
this occurred about two o'clock in the morning .,4
"on november 26 , at three o'clock in the morning , the nautilus cleared the tropic of cancer at longitude 172 degrees . on the 27th it passed in sight of the hawaiian islands , where the famous captain cook met his death on february 14 , 1779 . by then we had fared 4,860 leagues from our starting point . when i arrived on the platform that morning , i saw the island of hawaii two miles to leeward , the largest of the seven islands making up this group . i could clearly distinguish the tilled soil on its outskirts , the various mountain chains running parallel with its coastline , and its volcanoes , crowned by mauna kea , whose elevation is 5,000 meters above sea level . among other specimens from these waterways , our nets brought up some peacock - tailed flabellarian coral , polyps flattened into stylish shapes and unique to this part of the ocean .",6
""" you have confessed that you asked sir charles to be at the gate at ten o'clock . we know that that was the place and hour of his death . you have withheld what the connection is between these events . """,16
"such were the loud and startling words which resounded through the air , above the vast watery desert of the pacific , about four o'clock in the evening of the 23rd of march , 1865 .",24
"accordingly , that same evening milady commenced her journey . night overtook her ; she stopped , and slept at an inn . at five o’clock the next morning she again proceeded , and in three hours after entered bethune .",25
"on the day after the morrow , by eleven o’clock , the two diamond studs were finished , and they were so completely imitated , so perfectly alike , that buckingham could not tell the new ones from the old ones , and experts in such matters would have been deceived as he was .",9
"towards eleven o'clock , the lower region of the air was sensibly clearer .",2
"he therefore found d’artagnan alone , and as it was nearly eight o’clock he took the young man with him .",12
""" very serious , indeed -- the one thing upon earth which could have disarranged my plans . he ca n't be very long , now . it is already ten o'clock . our success and even his life may depend upon his coming out before the fog is over the path . """,31
"towards two o'clock in the afternoon , while it was snowing hard , long whistles were heard approaching from the east . a great shadow , preceded by a wild light , slowly advanced , appearing still larger through the mist , which gave it a fantastic aspect . no train was expected from the east , neither had there been time for the succour asked for by telegraph to arrive ; the train from omaha to san francisco was not due till the next day . the mystery was soon explained .",2
"near four o'clock in the afternoon , unable to control the impatience and uneasiness devouring me , i went back to the central companionway . the hatch was open . i ventured onto the platform . the captain was still strolling there , his steps agitated . he stared at the ship , which stayed to his leeward five or six miles off . he was circling it like a wild beast , drawing it eastward , letting it chase after him . yet he did n't attack . was he , perhaps , still undecided ?",2
"the next day about nine o’clock in the morning , he landed at st . valery .",5
"at three o'clock in the morning , full of uneasiness , i climbed onto the platform . captain nemo had n't left it . he stood in the bow next to his flag , which a mild breeze was unfurling above his head . his eyes never left that vessel . the extraordinary intensity of his gaze seemed to attract it , beguile it , and draw it more surely than if he had it in tow !",2
at four o'clock the balloon was only 500 feet above the surface of the water .,2
"but you have been traveling these four days , as you told me yourself . this morning you rose at five o’clock ; you must stand in need of repose .",21
"i stood there until six o'clock in the morning , captain nemo never seeming to notice me . the vessel lay a mile and a half off , and with the first glimmers of daylight , it resumed its cannonade . the time could n't be far away when the nautilus would attack its adversary , and my companions and i would leave forever this man i dared not judge .",5
""" i have a purpose in asking , "" resumed fix . "" is it absolutely necessary that you should be in new york on the 11th , before nine o'clock in the evening , the time that the steamer leaves for liverpool ? """,30
"at seven o'clock the log told me that the nautilus had reduced speed . i realized that it was letting the warship approach . moreover , the explosions grew more intensely audible . shells furrowed the water around us , drilling through it with an odd hissing sound .",2
"in two bounds he was at the louvre ; as he entered the wicket of l’echelle , ten o’clock struck .",18
"at eight o'clock the sledge was ready to start . the passengers took their places on it , and wrapped themselves up closely in their travelling - cloaks . the two great sails were hoisted , and under the pressure of the wind the sledge slid over the hardened snow with a velocity of forty miles an hour .",2
"at pontoise he changed his horse for the last time , and at nine o’clock galloped into the yard of treville ’s hotel .",14
"although the musketeer was not expected before one o’clock , the procurator ’s wife had been on the watch ever since midday , reckoning that the heart , or perhaps the stomach , of her lover would bring him before his time .",8
"the train passed rapidly across the state of iowa , by council bluffs , des moines , and iowa city . during the night it crossed the mississippi at davenport , and by rock island entered illinois . the next day , which was the 10th , at four o'clock in the evening , it reached chicago , already risen from its ruins , and more proudly seated than ever on the borders of its beautiful lake michigan .",49
"at eleven o'clock the electric lights came back on . i went into the lounge . it was deserted . i consulted the various instruments . the nautilus was fleeing northward at a speed of twenty - five miles per hour , sometimes on the surface of the sea , sometimes thirty feet beneath it .",2
"by then it was three o'clock in the afternoon . the current was slacking off , it was almost full tide . the nautilus drew near this island , which i can see to this day with its remarkable fringe of screw pines . we hugged it from less than two miles out . a sudden jolt threw me down . the nautilus had just struck a reef , and it remained motionless , listing slightly to port .",5
"at ten o’clock in the morning the sieur de la coste , ensign in the king ’s guards , followed by two officers and several archers of that body , came to the city registrar , named clement , and demanded of him all the keys of the rooms and offices of the hotel .",2
"at eleven o’clock came in his turn duhallier , captain of the guards , bringing with him fifty archers , who were distributed immediately through the hotel de ville , at the doors assigned them .",2

at nine o’clock madame la premiere presidente arrived .,2
"at ten o’clock , the king ’s collation , consisting of preserves and other delicacies , was prepared in the little room on the side of the church of st . jean , in front of the silver buffet of the city , which was guarded by four archers .",2
"immediately the aldermen , clothed in their cloth robes and preceded by six sergeants , each holding a flambeau in his hand , went to attend upon the king , whom they met on the steps , where the provost of the merchants made him the speech of welcome -- a compliment to which his majesty replied with an apology for coming so late , laying the blame upon the cardinal , who had detained him till eleven o’clock , talking of affairs of state .",78
"at six o'clock i ate supper , but i had no appetite . despite my revulsion , i forced it down , wanting to keep my strength up .",2

"even so , ten o'clock was about to strike . it was time to leave my stateroom and rejoin my companions . i dared not hesitate , even if captain nemo stood before me . i opened the door cautiously , but as it swung on its hinges , it seemed to make a frightful noise . this noise existed , perhaps , only in my imagination !",4
"but pencroft , relieved by neb , did so well , that towards four o'clock in the evening , the mine was finished .",14

"finally , at five o'clock in the afternoon , laden with all our treasures , we left the island beach and half an hour later pulled alongside the nautilus . nobody appeared on our arrival . the enormous sheet - iron cylinder seemed deserted . our provisions loaded on board , i went below to my stateroom . there i found my supper ready . i ate and then fell asleep .",4
"the henrietta entered queenstown harbour at one o'clock in the morning , it then being high tide ; and phileas fogg , after being grasped heartily by the hand by captain speedy , left that gentleman on the levelled hulk of his craft , which was still worth half what he had sold it for .",7
"at five o'clock he rang his bell for his servant and gave him orders to pack his things for the night - express to town , and to have the brougham at the door by eight - thirty . he was determined not to sleep another night at selby royal . it was an ill - omened place . death walked there in the sunlight . the grass of the forest had been spotted with blood .",2
there were several rapid locomotives on hand ; but the railway arrangements did not permit the special train to leave until three o'clock .,22

"towards five o'clock in the morning of the 25th of march , the sky began to lighten ; the horizon still remained dark , but with daybreak a thick mist rose from the sea , so that the eye could scarcely penetrate beyond twenty feet or so from where they stood .",2
"so the skiff did n't leave shipside that day , much to the displeasure of mr . land who could n't complete his provisions . the adroit canadian spent his time preparing the meat and flour products he had brought from gueboroa island . as for the savages , they went back to shore near eleven o'clock in the morning , when the heads of coral began to disappear under the waves of the rising tide . but i saw their numbers swell considerably on the beach . it was likely that they had come from neighboring islands or from the mainland of papua proper . however , i did n't see one local dugout canoe .",56
