""" yes , since those poor fishermen ca n't stay long underwater . on his voyage to ceylon , the englishman percival made much of a kaffir who stayed under five minutes without coming up to the surface , but i find that hard to believe . i know that some divers can last up to fifty - seven seconds , and highly skillful ones to eighty - seven ; but such men are rare , and when the poor fellows climb back on board , the water coming out of their noses and ears is tinted with blood . i believe the average time underwater that these fishermen can tolerate is thirty seconds , during which they hastily stuff their little nets with all the pearl oysters they can tear loose . but these fishermen generally do n't live to advanced age : their vision weakens , ulcers break out on their eyes , sores form on their bodies , and some are even stricken with apoplexy on the ocean floor .

"how was i to return ? there was not a trace of their footsteps or of my own , for the foot left no mark upon the granite floor . i racked my brain for a solution of this impracticable problem . one word described my position . lost !",28
"the front door was open , so we rushed in and hurried from room to room to the amazement of a doddering old manservant , who met us in the passage . there was no light save in the dining - room , but holmes caught up the lamp and left no corner of the house unexplored . no sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing . on the upper floor , however , one of the bedroom doors was locked .",74
suddenly i felt a mild jolt . i realized the nautilus had come to rest on the ocean floor . my alarm increased . the canadian 's signal had n't reached me . i longed to rejoin ned land and urge him to postpone his attempt . i sensed that we were no longer navigating under normal conditions .,18
"as to aramis , he dwelt in a little lodging composed of a boudoir , an eating room , and a bedroom , which room , situated , as the others were , on the ground floor , looked out upon a little fresh green garden , shady and impenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors .",36
""" the writing on the wall was done with a man 's forefinger dipped in blood . my glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing it , which would not have been the case if the man 's nail had been trimmed . i gathered up some scattered ash from the floor . it was dark in colour and flakey — such an ash as is only made by a trichinopoly . i have made a special study of cigar ashes — in fact , i have written a monograph upon the subject . i flatter myself that i can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand , either of cigar or of tobacco . it is just in such details that the skilled detective differs from the gregson and lestrade type . """,57
"and yet , at the very door the musketeer began to entertain some doubts . the approach was not such as to prepossess people -- an ill - smelling , dark passage , a staircase half - lighted by bars through which stole a glimmer from a neighboring yard ; on the first floor a low door studded with enormous nails , like the principal gate of the grand chatelet .",53
"it was therefore necessary to fix piles in the bed of the river so as to sustain the floor of the bridge and establish a pile - driver to act on the tops of these piles , which would thus form two arches and allow the bridge to support heavy loads .",18
""" women are not always allowed a choice , "" he answered , but hardly had he finished the sentence before from the far end of the conservatory came a stifled groan , followed by the dull sound of a heavy fall . everybody started up . the duchess stood motionless in horror . and with fear in his eyes , lord henry rushed through the flapping palms to find dorian gray lying face downwards on the tiled floor in a deathlike swoon .",78
"those piles of stones just mentioned were laid out on the ocean floor with a distinct but inexplicable symmetry . i spotted gigantic furrows trailing off into the distant darkness , their length incalculable . there also were other peculiarities i could n't make sense of . it seemed to me that my heavy lead soles were crushing a litter of bones that made a dry crackling noise . so what were these vast plains we were now crossing ? i wanted to ask the captain , but i still did n't grasp that sign language that allowed him to chat with his companions when they went with him on his underwater excursions .",12
"after going down a fairly steep slope , our feet trod the floor of a sort of circular pit . there captain nemo stopped , and his hand indicated an object that i had n't yet noticed . it was an oyster of extraordinary dimensions , a titanic giant clam , a holy - water font that could have held a whole lake , a basin more than two meters wide , hence even bigger than the one adorning the nautilus 's lounge .",12
"and while the three musketeers entered the ground floor room , the cardinal , without asking further information , ascended the staircase like a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to him .",8
"i confined myself then to begging him to give up his chamber , which is the handsomest in the hotel , and to be satisfied with a pretty little room on the third floor ; but to this monsieur porthos replied that as he every moment expected his mistress , who was one of the greatest ladies in the court , i might easily comprehend that the chamber he did me the honor to occupy in my house was itself very mean for the visit of such a personage .",33
"the room in which i found myself was very large and lofty . the windows were long , narrow , and pointed , and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within .",33
""" sir , it removed my veil from its gaunt head , rent it in two parts , and flinging both on the floor , trampled on them . """,23
"i could see clearly a room with a sanded floor , clean scoured ; a dresser of walnut , with pewter plates ranged in rows , reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing peat - fire .",9
""" the man was seen , "" continued lestrade . "" a milk boy , passing on his way to the dairy , happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel . he noticed that a ladder , which usually lay there , was raised against one of the windows of the second floor , which was wide open . after passing , he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder . he came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel . he took no particular notice of him , beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him to be at work . he has an impression that the man was tall , had a reddish face , and was dressed in a long , brownish coat . he must have stayed in the room some little time after the murder , for we found blood - stained water in the basin , where he had washed his hands , and marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife . """,62
"captain nemo decided to make for the ocean floor by submerging on an appropriately gradual diagonal with the help of his side fins , which were set at a 45 degrees angle to the nautilus 's waterline . then the propeller was brought to its maximum speed , and its four blades churned the waves with indescribable violence .",8
"this done , they entered the grotto , of which the floor was strewn with bones , the guns were carefully loaded , in case of a sudden attack , they had supper , and then just before they lay down to rest , the heap of wood piled at the entrance was set fire to .",11
"my eyes flew back to the pressure gauge . the instrument indicated a depth of 6,000 meters . our submergence had been going on for an hour . the nautilus slid downward on its slanting fins , still sinking . these deserted waters were wonderfully clear , with a transparency impossible to convey . an hour later we were at 13,000 meters-- about three and a quarter vertical leagues -- and the ocean floor was nowhere in sight .",73
"going back under the waters , the nautilus drew near the coast , cruising along it for only a few miles . through the lounge windows i could see long creepers and gigantic fucus plants , bulb - bearing seaweed of which the open sea at the pole had revealed a few specimens ; with their smooth , viscous filaments , they measured as much as 300 meters long ; genuine cables more than an inch thick and very tough , they 're often used as mooring lines for ships . another weed , known by the name velp and boasting four - foot leaves , was crammed into the coral concretions and carpeted the ocean floor . it served as both nest and nourishment for myriads of crustaceans and mollusks , for crabs and cuttlefish . here seals and otters could indulge in a sumptuous meal , mixing meat from fish with vegetables from the sea , like the english with their irish stews .",116
"before i had time to express the surprise this new proposition caused me , a camera was carried into the lounge at captain nemo 's request . the liquid setting , electrically lit , unfolded with perfect clarity through the wide - open panels . no shadows , no blurs , thanks to our artificial light . not even sunshine could have been better for our purposes . with the thrust of its propeller curbed by the slant of its fins , the nautilus stood still . the camera was aimed at the scenery on the ocean floor , and in a few seconds we had a perfect negative .",97
"i had not gone a hundred paces before incontestable proofs presented themselves . it could not be otherwise , for in the silurian age the seas contained at least fifteen hundred vegetable and animal species . my feet , which had become accustomed to the indurated lava floor , suddenly rested upon a dust composed of the _ debris _ of plants and shells . in the walls were distinct impressions of fucoids and lycopodites . professor liedenbrock could not be mistaken , i thought , and yet he pushed on , with , i suppose , his eyes resolutely shut .",47
"his hand shook , and the candle fell from its socket on the floor and lay there sputtering . he placed his foot on it and put it out . then he flung himself into the rickety chair that was standing by the table and buried his face in his hands .",13
"there was a stifled groan and the horrible sound of some one choking with blood . three times the outstretched arms shot up convulsively , waving grotesque , stiff - fingered hands in the air . he stabbed him twice more , but the man did not move . something began to trickle on the floor . he waited for a moment , still pressing the head down . then he threw the knife on the table , and listened .",55
""" i shall sully the purity of your floor , "" said he , "" but you must excuse me for once . "" then he approached the fire .",8
""" the nautilus is not aground , sir , "" captain nemo replied icily . "" the nautilus was built to rest on the ocean floor , and i do n't need to undertake the arduous labors , the maneuvers d'urville had to attempt in order to float off his sloops of war . the zealous and the new astrolabe wellnigh perished , but my nautilus is in no danger . tomorrow , on the day stated and at the hour stated , the tide will peacefully lift it off , and it will resume its navigating through the seas . """,25
my slippers were thin : i could walk the matted floor as softly as a cat .,10
"m. de treville was about to reprehend this breach of the rules of etiquette , when he felt the hand of athos , who had rallied all his energies to contend against pain , at length overcome by it , fell upon the floor as if he were dead .",43
"yes , our brave settlers had reason to be satisfied , and pencroft was lavish in his praise of what he humorously called , "" his apartments on the fifth floor above the ground ! """,30
"god doubtless neither heard nor saw me , and i sank upon the floor a prey to a slumber which resembled death . "" of all that passed in that sleep , or the time which glided away while it lasted , i have no remembrance . the only thing i recollect is that i awoke in bed in a round chamber , the furniture of which was sumptuous , and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the ceiling . no door gave entrance to the room . it might be called a magnificent prison .",13
"yes ; but in order to avenge herself she must be free . and to be free , a prisoner has to pierce a wall , detach bars , cut through a floor -- all undertakings which a patient and strong man may accomplish , but before which the feverish irritations of a woman must give way .",32
""" well , monsieur has only to take the right - hand staircase in the courtyard , and knock at number five on the second floor . """,25
"thus day followed day ; and as sure as morning came he found that his unseen enemies had kept their register , and had marked up in some conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the month of grace . sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls , sometimes upon the floors , occasionally they were on small placards stuck upon the garden gate or the railings . with all his vigilance john ferrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded . a horror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of them . he became haggard and restless , and his eyes had the troubled look of some hunted creature . he had but one hope in life now , and that was for the arrival of the young hunter from nevada .",57
"athos collected himself , and in proportion as he did so , d’artagnan saw that he became pale . he was at that period of intoxication in which vulgar drinkers fall on the floor and go to sleep .",33
"for a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold — then , with a low moaning cry , fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother , and in her violent and now final death - agonies , bore him to the floor a corpse , and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated .",48
"the blaze there has thawed all the snow from your cloak ; by the same token , it has streamed on to my floor , and made it like a trampled street .",23
"to say that the settlers , notwithstanding their fatigue , slept well on the sandy floor of the chimneys would not be true .",15
"a table , which had been covered with an elegant supper , was overturned . the decanters broken in pieces , and the fruits crushed , strewed the floor .",28
"d’artagnan flew to his hole , laid himself down on the floor at full length , and listened .",11
""" they are binding her ; they are going to drag her away , "" cried d’artagnan to himself , springing up from the floor .",24
"the floor was covered with fine sand , and taking all in all they were well pleased with it for want of a better .",1
"the nets were hauled on board . they were a breed of trawl resembling those used off the normandy coast , huge pouches held half open by a floating pole and a chain laced through the lower meshes . trailing in this way from these iron glove makers , the resulting receptacles scoured the ocean floor and collected every marine exhibit in their path . that day they gathered up some unusual specimens from these fish - filled waterways : anglerfish whose comical movements qualify them for the epithet "" clowns , "" black commerson anglers equipped with their antennas , undulating triggerfish encircled by little red bands , bloated puffers whose venom is extremely insidious , some olive - hued lampreys , snipefish covered with silver scales , cutlass fish whose electrocuting power equals that of the electric eel and the electric ray , scaly featherbacks with brown crosswise bands , greenish codfish , several varieties of goby , etc . ; finally , some fish of larger proportions : a one - meter jack with a prominent head , several fine bonito from the genus scomber decked out in the colors blue and silver , and three magnificent tuna whose high speeds could n't save them from our trawl .",55
"i finally understood ! this clearing was a cemetery , this hole a grave , that oblong object the body of the man who must have died during the night ! captain nemo and his men had come to bury their companion in this communal resting place on the inaccessible ocean floor !",51
"' i ca n't go no lower , ' said the hatter : ' i 'm on the floor , as it is . '",18
"the grotto was an immense apartment . along its granite floor ran our faithful stream . at this distance from its spring the water was scarcely tepid , and we drank of it with pleasure .",10
""" professor aronnax , "" he asked me , "" do you know the depth of the ocean floor ? """,18
"there the ocean floor formed a valley 120 kilometers wide , into which you could fit mt . blanc without its summit poking above the surface of the waves . this valley is closed off to the east by a sheer wall 2,000 meters high . we arrived there on may 28 , and the nautilus lay no farther than 150 kilometers from ireland . would captain nemo head up north and beach us on the british isles ? no . much to my surprise , he went back down south and returned to european seas . as we swung around the emerald isle , i spotted cape clear for an instant , plus the lighthouse on fastnet rock that guides all those thousands of ships setting out from glasgow or liverpool .",3
