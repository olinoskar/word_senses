"when all was finished , i thought moor house as complete a model of bright modest snugness within , as it was , at this season , a specimen of wintry waste and desert dreariness without . the eventful thursday at length came .",33

"a sudden pallor overspread the detective 's face . separate himself from the man whom he had so persistently followed step by step ! leave him to wander about in this desert ! fix gazed attentively at mr . fogg , and , despite his suspicions and of the struggle which was going on within him , he lowered his eyes before that calm and frank look .",31
"we were advancing at a rapid pace . the country was already almost a desert . here and there was a lonely farm , called a boër built either of wood , or of sods , or of pieces of lava , looking like a poor beggar by the wayside . these ruinous huts seemed to solicit charity from passers - by ; and on very small provocation we should have given alms for the relief of the poor inmates . in this country there were no roads and paths , and the poor vegetation , however slow , would soon efface the rare travellers ' footsteps .",14
"yet this part of the province , at a very small distance from the capital , is reckoned among the inhabited and cultivated portions of iceland . what , then , must other tracts be , more desert than this desert ? in the first half mile we had not seen one farmer standing before his cabin door , nor one shepherd tending a flock less wild than himself , nothing but a few cows and sheep left to themselves . what then would be those convulsed regions upon which we were advancing , regions subject to the dire phenomena of eruptions , the offspring of volcanic explosions and subterranean convulsions ?",40

"as usual , dinner was served me in my stateroom . full of anxiety , i ate little . i left the table at seven o'clock . 120 minutes-- i was keeping track of them -- still separated me from the moment i was to rejoin ned land . my agitation increased . my pulse was throbbing violently . i could n't stand still . i walked up and down , hoping to calm my troubled mind with movement . the possibility of perishing in our reckless undertaking was the least of my worries ; my heart was pounding at the thought that our plans might be discovered before we had left the nautilus , at the thought of being hauled in front of captain nemo and finding him angered , or worse , saddened by my deserting him .",137
"crossing through the lounge , i arrived at the door , contrived in one of the canted corners , that opened into the captain 's stateroom . much to my astonishment , this door was ajar . i instinctively recoiled . if captain nemo was in his stateroom , he might see me . but , not hearing any sounds , i approached . the stateroom was deserted . i pushed the door open . i took a few steps inside . still the same austere , monastic appearance .",67

"near 5:30 the first glimmers of light on the horizon defined the upper lines of the coast with greater distinctness . fairly flat to the east , it swelled a little toward the south . five miles still separated it from us , and its beach merged with the misty waters . between us and the shore , the sea was deserted . not a boat , not a diver . profound solitude reigned over this gathering place of pearl fishermen . as captain nemo had commented , we were arriving in these waterways a month too soon .",61

"in fact , there beneath my eyes was a town in ruins , demolished , overwhelmed , laid low , its roofs caved in , its temples pulled down , its arches dislocated , its columns stretching over the earth ; in these ruins you could still detect the solid proportions of a sort of tuscan architecture ; farther off , the remains of a gigantic aqueduct ; here , the caked heights of an acropolis along with the fluid forms of a parthenon ; there , the remnants of a wharf , as if some bygone port had long ago harbored merchant vessels and triple - tiered war galleys on the shores of some lost ocean ; still farther off , long rows of collapsing walls , deserted thoroughfares , a whole pompeii buried under the waters , which captain nemo had resurrected before my eyes !",128

"all the way , and in proportion as the corridors became more deserted , d’artagnan wished to stop the young woman , seize her and gaze upon her , were it only for a minute ; but quick as a bird she glided between his hands , and when he wished to speak to her , her finger placed upon her mouth , with a little imperative gesture full of grace , reminded him that he was under the command of a power which he must blindly obey , and which forbade him even to make the slightest complaint . at length , after winding about for a minute or two , mme . bonacieux opened the door of a closet , which was entirely dark , and led d’artagnan into it .",12

"finally , at five o'clock in the afternoon , laden with all our treasures , we left the island beach and half an hour later pulled alongside the nautilus . nobody appeared on our arrival . the enormous sheet - iron cylinder seemed deserted . our provisions loaded on board , i went below to my stateroom . there i found my supper ready . i ate and then fell asleep .",43

"and this reaction was n't long in coming . for three months , during which each day seemed like a century , the abraham lincoln plowed all the northerly seas of the pacific , racing after whales sighted , abruptly veering off course , swerving sharply from one tack to another , stopping suddenly , putting on steam and reversing engines in quick succession , at the risk of stripping its gears , and it did n't leave a single point unexplored from the beaches of japan to the coasts of america . and we found nothing ! nothing except an immenseness of deserted waves ! nothing remotely resembling a gigantic narwhale , or an underwater islet , or a derelict shipwreck , or a runaway reef , or anything the least bit unearthly !",103

"as he looked back upon man moving through history , he was haunted by a feeling of loss . so much had been surrendered ! and to such little purpose ! there had been mad wilful rejections , monstrous forms of self - torture and self - denial , whose origin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely more terrible than that fancied degradation from which , in their ignorance , they had sought to escape ; nature , in her wonderful irony , driving out the anchorite to feed with the wild animals of the desert and giving to the hermit the beasts of the field as his companions .",98

"after his first depression , passepartout became calmer , and began to study his situation . it was certainly not an enviable one . he found himself on the way to japan , and what should he do when he got there ? his pocket was empty ; he had not a solitary shilling , not so much as a penny . his passage had fortunately been paid for in advance ; and he had five or six days in which to decide upon his future course . he fell to at meals with an appetite , and ate for mr . fogg , aouda , and himself . he helped himself as generously as if japan were a desert , where nothing to eat was to be looked for .",119
"in two minutes we were on the strand . loading provisions and weapons into the skiff , pushing it to sea , and positioning its two oars were the work of an instant . we had n't gone two cable lengths when a hundred savages , howling and gesticulating , entered the water up to their waists . i looked to see if their appearance might draw some of the nautilus 's men onto the platform . but no . lying well out , that enormous machine still seemed completely deserted .",90
"my eyes flew back to the pressure gauge . the instrument indicated a depth of 6,000 meters . our submergence had been going on for an hour . the nautilus slid downward on its slanting fins , still sinking . these deserted waters were wonderfully clear , with a transparency impossible to convey . an hour later we were at 13,000 meters-- about three and a quarter vertical leagues -- and the ocean floor was nowhere in sight .",41

"for two days we visited these deep and deserted waters by means of our slanting fins . the nautilus would do long , diagonal dives that took us to every level . but on april 11 it rose suddenly , and the shore reappeared at the mouth of the amazon river , a huge estuary whose outflow is so considerable , it desalts the sea over an area of several leagues .",8
"in the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the sierra blanco . as far as the eye can reach stretches the great flat plain - land , all dusted over with patches of alkali , and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes . on the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks , with their rugged summits flecked with snow . in this great stretch of country there is no sign of life , nor of anything appertaining to life . there is no bird in the steel - blue heaven , no movement upon the dull , grey earth — above all , there is absolute silence . listen as one may , there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness ; nothing but silence — complete and heart - subduing silence . it has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain . that is hardly true . looking down from the sierra blanco , one sees a pathway traced out across the desert , which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance . it is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers . here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun , and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali . approach , and examine them ! they are bones : some large and coarse , others smaller and more delicate . the former have belonged to oxen , and the latter to men . for fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside .",190
