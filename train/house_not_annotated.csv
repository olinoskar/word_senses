"upon their arrival at venice candide went in search of cacambo at every inn and coffee - house , and among all the ladies of pleasure , but could hear nothing of him . he sent every day to inquire what ships were in , still no news of cacambo .",17
i know another way to the house . it does not signify if i knew twenty ways ; for he has seen me .,6
""" i have heard great talk , "" said candide , "" of the senator pococurante , who lives in that fine house at the brenta , where , they say , he entertains foreigners in the most polite manner . "" "" they pretend this man is a perfect stranger to uneasiness .",22
"my uncle looked , he compared , and the house shook with his triumphant leap of exultation .",9
it was also decided that no one should remain at granite house .,11

but at that moment the summons sounded for dinner ; all re - entered the house .,15
""" my dear master , "" replied cacambo , "" miss cunegund washes dishes on the banks of the propontis , in the house of a prince who has very few to wash . she is at present a slave in the family of an ancient sovereign named ragotsky , whom the grand turk allows three crowns a day to maintain him in his exile ; but the most melancholy circumstance of all is , that she is turned horribly ugly . """,23
"i left moor house at three o'clock p.m. , and soon after four i stood at the foot of the sign - post of whitcross , waiting the arrival of the coach which was to take me to distant thornfield .",3
""" nothing is more possible , "" answered cacambo , "" for she scours the dishes in the house of a transylvanian prince . """,18
"the engineer then made known to his companions the proposal which had been made to him , and it was agreed that they should build a wooden house at the corral , which they would make as comfortable as possible .",27
"that very day the colonists repaired to the corral with the necessary tools , and a week had not passed before the house was ready to receive its tenant .",22
"while candide , the baron , pangloss , martin , and cacambo , were relating their several adventures , and reasoning on the contingent or noncontingent events of this world ; on causes and effects ; on moral and physical evil ; on free will and necessity ; and on the consolation that may be felt by a person when a slave and chained to an oar in a turkish galley , they arrived at the house of the transylvanian prince on the shores of the propontis .",76
"in what land ? under what auspices ? my eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower near the gates , and i asked , "" is he with damer de rochester , sharing the shelter of his narrow marble house ? """,40
"the house may be suspected ; but i deny that it is so in the part of it inhabited my monsieur dâ€™artagnan , for i can affirm , sire , if i can believe what he says , that there does not exist a more devoted servant of your majesty , or a more profound admirer of monsieur the cardinal . """,1

"we must convey it to granite house , where we can open it easily , and without breaking it .",6
"i never saw her myself ; but i 've heard leah , the house - maid , tell of her . leah liked her well enough . mr . rochester was about forty , and this governess not twenty ; and you see , when gentlemen of his age fall in love with girls , they are often like as if they were bewitched .",13
"where does he now live ? "" "" at ferndean , a manor - house on a farm he has , about thirty miles off : quite a desolate spot . """,14
"the manor - house of ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity , moderate size , and no architectural pretensions , deep buried in a wood .",3
"even when within a very short distance of the manor - house , you could see nothing of it , so thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it .",11
this time my determination is irrevocably taken . after the siege i shall enter the house of the lazarists .,15
"john withdrew without having observed me . mr . rochester now tried to walk about : vainly,--all was too uncertain . he groped his way back to the house , and , re - entering it , closed the door .",28
