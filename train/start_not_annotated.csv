"on thursday , at 8 a.m. , we started afresh . the granite tunnel winding from side to side , earned us past unexpected turns , and seemed almost to form a labyrinth ; but , on the whole , its direction seemed to be south - easterly . my uncle never ceased to consult his compass , to keep account of the ground gone over .",8
"it is true i had been very unfortunate by sea , and this might be one of the reasons ; but let no man slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts in cases of such moment : two of the ships which i had singled out to go in , i mean more particularly singled out than any other , having put my things on board one of them , and in the other having agreed with the captain ; i say two of these ships miscarried . one was taken by the algerines , and the other was lost on the start , near torbay , and all the people drowned except three ; so that in either of those vessels i had been made miserable .",103

"dorian started and peered round . "" this will do , "" he answered , and having got out hastily and given the driver the extra fare he had promised him , he walked quickly in the direction of the quay . here and there a lantern gleamed at the stern of some huge merchantman . the light shook and splintered in the puddles . a red glare came from an outward - bound steamer that was coaling . the slimy pavement looked like a wet mackintosh .",1

"as the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art , a smile of pleasure passed across his face , and seemed about to linger there . but he suddenly started up , and closing his eyes , placed his fingers upon the lids , as though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he might awake .",38
