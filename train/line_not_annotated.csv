"indeed , larger blocks of ice soon appeared , their brilliance varying at the whim of the mists . some of these masses displayed green veins , as if scrawled with undulating lines of copper sulfate . others looked like enormous amethysts , letting the light penetrate their insides . the latter reflected the sun 's rays from the thousand facets of their crystals . the former , tinted with a bright limestone sheen , would have supplied enough building material to make a whole marble town .",32
"the arbour was an arch in the wall , lined with ivy ; it contained a rustic seat .",9
""" here , professor aronnax , are the different dimensions of this boat now transporting you . it 's a very long cylinder with conical ends . it noticeably takes the shape of a cigar , a shape already adopted in london for several projects of the same kind . the length of this cylinder from end to end is exactly seventy meters , and its maximum breadth of beam is eight meters . so it is n't quite built on the ten - to - one ratio of your high - speed steamers ; but its lines are sufficiently long , and their tapering gradual enough , so that the displaced water easily slips past and poses no obstacle to the ship 's movements .",97
""" listen , then , jane eyre , to your sentence : to - morrow , place the glass before you , and draw in chalk your own picture , faithfully , without softening one defect ; omit no harsh line , smooth away no displeasing irregularity ; write under it , ' portrait of a governess , disconnected , poor , and plain . '",40
"i will read you the first canto . it has four hundred lines , and lasts a minute . """,12
"i returned to the lounge . the hatch closed , and i heard water hissing in the ballast tanks . the nautilus began to sink on a vertical line , because its propeller was in check and no longer furnished any forward motion .",28
"equipped with picks , some ten men climbed onto the nautilus 's sides and cracked loose the ice around the ship 's lower plating , which was soon set free . this operation was swiftly executed because the fresh ice was still thin . we all reentered the interior . the main ballast tanks were filled with the water that had n't yet congealed at our line of flotation . the nautilus submerged without delay .",66
"at the back of this creek some violent convulsion had torn up the rocky border , and a cutting , by a gentle slope , gave access to an upper plateau , which might be situated at least ten miles from claw cape , and consequently four miles in a straight line from prospect heights .",51
""" you had only read a line or two , "" said d’artagnan ; "" read the letter again from the commencement . """,6
"the reef was the mark for which she was making in a direct line , under all steam , and the unfortunate colonists might have made her out some hours before if they had had the strength to watch the horizon .",13
"herbert carried a plumb - line which harding had given him , that is to say , a simple stone fastened to the end of a flexible fiber .",5
"having reached a spot about twenty feet from the edge of the beach , and nearly five hundred feet from the cliff , which rose perpendicularly , harding thrust the pole two feet into the sand , and wedging it up carefully , he managed , by means of the plumb - line , to erect it perpendicularly with the plane of the horizon .",52
"it took us two hours to reach the summit of this half - crystal , half - basalt peak . from there our eyes scanned a vast sea , which scrawled its boundary line firmly against the background of the northern sky . at our feet : dazzling tracts of white . over our heads : a pale azure , clear of mists . north of us : the sun 's disk , like a ball of fire already cut into by the edge of the horizon . from the heart of the waters : jets of liquid rising like hundreds of magnificent bouquets . far off , like a sleeping cetacean : the nautilus . behind us to the south and east : an immense shore , a chaotic heap of rocks and ice whose limits we could n't see .",33
"we may , perhaps , succeed in restoring her to them , if she is not obstinate : but i trace lines of force in her face which make me sceptical of her tractability . "" he stood considering me some minutes ; then added , "" she looks sensible , but not at all handsome . """,21
"the lines were made of fine creepers , fastened one to the other , of the length of fifteen or twenty feet .",1
"this done , pencroft , passing among the grass and concealing himself skillfully , placed the end of his lines armed with hooks near the grouse nests ; then he returned , took the other ends and hid with herbert behind a large tree .",19
"as for marine mammals , on passing by the mouth of the adriatic sea , i thought i recognized two or three sperm whales equipped with the single dorsal fin denoting the genus physeter , some pilot whales from the genus globicephalus exclusive to the mediterranean , the forepart of the head striped with small distinct lines , and also a dozen seals with white bellies and black coats , known by the name monk seals and just as solemn as if they were three - meter dominicans .",56
"suddenly with a smart jerk , pencroft "" struck "" his line , and a flapping of wings showed that the birds were taken .",11
"as to zinc , it may be remembered that the case found at flotsam point was lined with this metal , which could not be better utilized than for this purpose .",16
"on january 25 , the ocean being completely deserted , the nautilus spent the day on the surface , churning the waves with its powerful propeller and making them spurt to great heights . under these conditions , who would n't have mistaken it for a gigantic cetacean ? i spent three - quarters of the day on the platform . i stared at the sea . nothing on the horizon , except near four o'clock in the afternoon a long steamer to the west , running on our opposite tack . its masting was visible for an instant , but it could n't have seen the nautilus because we were lying too low in the water . i imagine that steamboat belonged to the peninsular & oriental line , which provides service from the island of ceylon to sidney , also calling at king george sound and melbourne .",128
"just then the seafloor began to slope sharply downward . the light took on a uniform hue . we reached a depth of 100 meters , by which point we were undergoing a pressure of ten atmospheres . but my diving clothes were built along such lines that i never suffered from this pressure . i felt only a certain tightness in the joints of my fingers , and even this discomfort soon disappeared . as for the exhaustion bound to accompany a two - hour stroll in such unfamiliar trappings -- it was nil . helped by the water , my movements were executed with startling ease .",46
"but there was no question now . we were stretched out on the back of some kind of underwater boat that , as far as i could judge , boasted the shape of an immense steel fish . ned land had clear views on the issue . conseil and i could only line up behind him .",52
"it was difficult to reply to pencroft , and as for the young boy making another attempt , that was not easy ; for the lower part of the ladder had been drawn again into the door , and when another pull was given , the line broke and the ladder remained firm .",46
"while walking near the wood of monsieur le prince , i laid a few snare in the runs ; and while reclining on the banks of his highness ’s pieces of water , i slipped a few lines into his fish ponds .",37
"during the night , in line with my forecasts , a new one - meter slice was removed from this immense socket . but in the morning , wearing my diving suit , i was crossing through the liquid mass in a temperature of -6 degrees to -7 degrees centigrade , when i noted that little by little the side walls were closing in on each other . the liquid strata farthest from the trench , not warmed by the movements of workmen and tools , were showing a tendency to solidify . in the face of this imminent new danger , what would happen to our chances for salvation , and how could we prevent this liquid medium from solidifying , then cracking the nautilus 's hull like glass ?",5
"i broke out in a cold sweat . but why should i have been startled by this reply ? on march 22 the nautilus had dived under the open waters at the pole . it was now the 26th . we had lived off the ship 's stores for five days ! and all remaining breathable air had to be saved for the workmen . even today as i write these lines , my sensations are so intense that an involuntary terror sweeps over me , and my lungs still seem short of air !",71
"possessed by one single thought -- that of the promise he had made , and of the responsibility he had taken -- he retired last to his chamber , begged the host to procure him a map of the province , bent over it , examined every line traced upon it , perceived that there were four different roads from bethune to armentieres , and summoned the lackeys .",47
"i could observe these strange walls quite closely : our sounding lines indicated that they dropped perpendicularly for more than 300 meters , and our electric beams made the bright limestone positively sparkle .",11
"in short , she studied everything , as a skillful comedian does to whom a new part has been assigned in a line to which he is not accustomed .",22
"d’artagnan , placed in line with his company , saluted with an expressive gesture his three friends , whose eyes soon discovered him , and m. de treville , who detected him at once .",4
"going back under the waters , the nautilus drew near the coast , cruising along it for only a few miles . through the lounge windows i could see long creepers and gigantic fucus plants , bulb - bearing seaweed of which the open sea at the pole had revealed a few specimens ; with their smooth , viscous filaments , they measured as much as 300 meters long ; genuine cables more than an inch thick and very tough , they 're often used as mooring lines for ships . another weed , known by the name velp and boasting four - foot leaves , was crammed into the coral concretions and carpeted the ocean floor . it served as both nest and nourishment for myriads of crustaceans and mollusks , for crabs and cuttlefish . here seals and otters could indulge in a sumptuous meal , mixing meat from fish with vegetables from the sea , like the english with their irish stews .",87
"near 5:30 the first glimmers of light on the horizon defined the upper lines of the coast with greater distinctness . fairly flat to the east , it swelled a little toward the south . five miles still separated it from us , and its beach merged with the misty waters . between us and the shore , the sea was deserted . not a boat , not a diver . profound solitude reigned over this gathering place of pearl fishermen . as captain nemo had commented , we were arriving in these waterways a month too soon .",13
"it could now be seen that one of the convicts held a lead - line in his hand , and that he wished to fathom the depth of the channel hollowed out by the current of the mercy .",14
"every minute athos was forced to restrain d’artagnan , constantly in advance of the little troop , and to beg him to keep in the line , which in an instant he again departed from . he had but one thought -- to go forward ; and he went .",25
the man at the helm and the man with the lead - line fell backwards into the boat .,12
"by then we had fared nearly 13,000 leagues from our starting point in the pacific high seas . our position fix placed us in latitude 45 degrees 37 ' south and longitude 37 degrees 53 ' west . these were the same waterways where captain denham , aboard the herald , payed out 14,000 meters of sounding line without finding bottom . it was here too that lieutenant parker , aboard the american frigate congress , was unable to reach the underwater soil at 15,149 meters .",57
""" i like this day ; i like that sky of steel ; i like the sternness and stillness of the world under this frost . i like thornfield , its antiquity , its retirement , its old crow - trees and thorn - trees , its grey facade , and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin : and yet how long have i abhorred the very thought of it , shunned it like a great plague - house ? how i do still abhor-- """,51
"and the sailor sounded with a long cord , which served him as a lead - line , and to which was fastened a lump of iron .",16
"in uttering these words i looked up : he seemed to me a tall gentleman ; but then i was very little ; his features were large , and they and all the lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim .",33
"again i ran , and again returned , bearing an immense mantle lined and edged with fur .",12
""" and these are some new breed of sounding line ? """,9
""" they 're thermometric sounding lines that report water temperatures in the different strata . """,5
"so the frigate was equipped for a far - off voyage and armed with fearsome fishing gear , but nobody knew where to steer it . and impatience grew until , on june 2 , word came that the tampico , a steamer on the san francisco line sailing from california to shanghai , had sighted the animal again , three weeks before in the northerly seas of the pacific .",47
