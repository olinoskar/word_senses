""" you see , "" said lord de winter , presenting d’artagnan to his sister , "" a young gentleman who has held my life in his hands , and who has not abused his advantage , although we have been twice enemies , although it was i who insulted him , and although i am an englishman .",8
""" ’ hear me , ’ said he ; ’ this man has gone , and for the moment has consequently escaped my vengeance ; but let us be united , as we were to have been , and then leave it to lord de winter to maintain his own honor and that of his wife . ’ """,45

""" yes , "" said milady , "" lord de winter ; and now you can understand it all , can you not ?",10
lord de winter perceived nothing of this .,2

"that pretty little soubrette whom d’artagnan had already observed then came in . she spoke some words to lord de winter in english , who thereupon requested d’artagnan ’s permission to retire , excusing himself on account of the urgency of the business that had called him away , and charging his sister to obtain his pardon .",20
"d’artagnan exchanged a shake of the hand with lord de winter , and then returned to milady .",10
""" well ; buckingham heard by some means , no doubt , of my return . he spoke of me to lord de winter , already prejudiced against me , and told him that his sister - in - law was a prostitute , a branded woman .",23
"she told d’artagnan that lord de winter was her brother - in - law , and not her brother . she had married a younger brother of the family , who had left her a widow with one child .",6
"this child was the only heir to lord de winter , if lord de winter did not marry .",14
face to face with lord de winter her plan of conduct was more easy . she had laid that down the preceding evening .,6
lord de winter was not at home ; and it was milady who this time did all the honors of the evening .,2
""" i set out five hours after her from portsmouth , "" said lord de winter .",15
""" are they both dead ? "" asked lord de winter , sternly .",10
""" ah , indeed , so much the better ! "" said lord de winter .",14
"there mr . fogg examined a curious vehicle , a kind of frame on two long beams , a little raised in front like the runners of a sledge , and upon which there was room for five or six persons . a high mast was fixed on the frame , held firmly by metallic lashings , to which was attached a large brigantine sail . this mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist a jib - sail . behind , a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle . it was , in short , a sledge rigged like a sloop . during the winter , when the trains are blocked up by the snow , these sledges make extremely rapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another . provided with more sails than a cutter , and with the wind behind them , they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not superior to that of the express trains .",108
"well , if necessary , we must put in to tabor island to spend the winter .",15
""" what , you are ignorant of lord de winter ’s designs upon me ? """,9
but lord de winter might suspect him ; felton himself might now be watched !,3
""" it appears , however , "" said lord de winter , "" if there are any measures to take against the countess , it concerns me ; she is my sister - in - law . """,10
""" i seek to divine nothing , madame ; i wait till i am confided in , and apart from that which lord de winter has said to me before you , he has confided nothing to me . """,24
""" you are deceived , madame , "" said felton , blushing ; "" lord de winter is not capable of such a crime . """,16
"she had only one day left . lord de winter had announced her embarkation for the twenty - third , and it was now the morning of the twenty - second .",9
"we were , as i have said , in the dining - room : the lustre , which had been lit for dinner , filled the room with a festal breadth of light ; the large fire was all red and clear ; the purple curtains hung rich and ample before the lofty window and loftier arch ; everything was still , save the subdued chat of adele ( she dared not speak loud ) , and , filling up each pause , the beating of winter rain against the panes .",86
someone was heard in the corridor ; milady recognized the step of lord de winter .,14
""" ah ! "" said milady , listening in her turn to the noise of felton ’s steps , which withdrew in a direction opposite to those of lord de winter ; "" at length you are mine ! """,30
""" yes , fair lady ! "" replied lord de winter , making a bow , half courteous , half ironical ; "" it is i , myself . """,10
in the evening lord de winter accompanied the supper .,5
"but perhaps it had been only his fancy that had called vengeance out of the night and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him . actual life was chaos , but there was something terribly logical in the imagination . it was the imagination that set remorse to dog the feet of sin . it was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen brood . in the common world of fact the wicked were not punished , nor the good rewarded . success was given to the strong , failure thrust upon the weak . that was all . besides , had any stranger been prowling round the house , he would have been seen by the servants or the keepers . had any foot - marks been found on the flower - beds , the gardeners would have reported it . yes , it had been merely fancy . sibyl vane 's brother had not come back to kill him . he had sailed away in his ship to founder in some winter sea . from him , at any rate , he was safe . why , the man did not know who he was , could not know who he was . the mask of youth had saved him .",176
"then turning his eyes from milady to the paper , he read : "" ’ order to conduct-- ’ the name is blank , "" interrupted lord de winter .",28
""" yes , yes , "" said lord de winter , who perceived what was passing in her mind ; "" yes , you look for the signature , and you say to yourself : ’ all is not lost , for that order is not signed . it is only shown to me to terrify me , that ’s all . ’",9
""" ah , to see me ? "" said de winter , cunningly .",10
"matters being thus decided , the building of a vessel large enough to sail either to the archipelagoes in the north , or to new zealand in the west , was no longer talked of , and they busied themselves in their accustomed occupations , with a view to wintering a third time in granite house .",49
"whatever command she had over herself , milady could not help starting ; and as in pronouncing the last words lord de winter placed his hand upon the arm of his sister , this start did not escape him .",22
"lord de winter rose , saluted her ironically , and went out .",2
"at eight o’clock in the evening athos ordered the horses to be saddled , and lord de winter and his friends notified that they must prepare for the expedition .",17
""" oh , my god , no ! "" said lord de winter , with apparent good nature . "" you wish to see me , and you come to england .",12
""" lord de winter . """,3
"she proposed a walk in the grounds . before we had been out two hours , we were deep in a confidential conversation : she had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent in london two seasons ago -- of the admiration she had there excited -- the attention she had received ; and i even got hints of the titled conquest she had made .",34
"milady knew that lord de winter lied , and she was the more alarmed .",5
""" but i think it would be still better , "" said aramis , "" to inform the queen and lord de winter at the same time . """,22
"ah , i can understand how the sight of him struck you , "" replied lord de winter . "" you came from a country where he must be very much talked of , and i know that his armaments against france greatly engage the attention of your friend the cardinal . """,17
""" my first husband ! "" cried milady , looking at lord de winter with eyes almost starting from their sockets .",13
""" i insult you ! "" said lord de winter , with contempt . "" in truth , madame , do you think that can be possible ? """,9
""" but i repeat it again to you , "" replied felton , in great emotion , "" no danger threatens you ; i will answer for lord de winter as for myself . """,29

"the moon was set , and it was very dark ; bessie carried a lantern , whose light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw . raw and chill was the winter morning : my teeth chattered as i hastened down the drive .",36
"lord de winter himself could scarcely recognize the tigress who , a minute before , prepared apparently for a fight .",2
"then he turned his attention to embroideries and to the tapestries that performed the office of frescoes in the chill rooms of the northern nations of europe . as he investigated the subject-- and he always had an extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the moment in whatever he took up -- he was almost saddened by the reflection of the ruin that time brought on beautiful and wonderful things . he , at any rate , had escaped that . summer followed summer , and the yellow jonquils bloomed and died many times , and nights of horror repeated the story of their shame , but he was unchanged . no winter marred his face or stained his flowerlike bloom .",113
"but you , madame , so beautiful in reality , you , so pure in appearance , must have committed great iniquities for lord de winter to pursue you thus . """,25
"at this moment the steps of lord de winter were heard ; but this time the terrible brother - in - law of milady did not content himself , as on the preceding day , with passing before the door and going away again . he paused , exchanged two words with the sentinel ; then the door opened , and he appeared .",8
""" and what favor , pray ? "" asked lord de winter .",11
""" there is someone , then , concealed here whose throat this amiable lady is desirous of cutting , "" said de winter , in an ironical , contemptuous tone .",22
""" i have given you the choice between america and tyburn , "" replied lord de winter . "" choose tyburn , madame . believe me , the cord is more certain than the knife . """,16
"and lord de winter ranged himself by the side of d’artagnan , leaving the place free for another accuser .",3
felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones ; probably lord de winter perceived this emotion .,15
""" your opinion is very admissible indeed , my dear spilett , "" answered cyrus harding , "" and it is evidently to the proximity of icebergs that we owe our rigorous winters .",32
"at the name of lord de winter , who was known to be one of his grace ’s most intimate friends , the officer of the post gave orders to let felton pass , who , besides , wore the uniform of a naval officer .",6
"patrick , who knew lord de winter was in affairs of the service , and in relations of friendship with the duke , gave the preference to the one who came in his name .",6

"athos , who heard milady ’s voice , came sharply up . lord de winter did the same .",14
"we had been wandering , indeed , in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning ; but since dinner ( mrs . reed , when there was no company , dined early ) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre , and a rain so penetrating , that further out - door exercise was now out of the question .",36

"nevertheless , the colonists were well prepared to meet the winter , however hard it might be .",10
"felton cast his eyes round for means of escape , and seeing the door free , he rushed into the next chamber , in which , as we have said , the deputies from la rochelle were waiting , crossed it as quickly as possible , and rushed toward the staircase ; but upon the first step he met lord de winter , who , seeing him pale , confused , livid , and stained with blood both on his hands and face , seized him by the throat , crying , "" i knew it ! i guessed it !",61
lord de winter advanced in his turn .,2
lord de winter tore his hair .,2

"i was a mile from thornfield , in a lane noted for wild roses in summer , for nuts and blackberries in autumn , and even now possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws , but whose best winter delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose .",40

"de winter , stupefied , looked on while the soldiers bound felton , and could not tell what to think of such insensibility .",1

"one expression above all recurred to the mind of the prisoner : "" if i had listened to you , "" lord de winter had said to felton .",23
