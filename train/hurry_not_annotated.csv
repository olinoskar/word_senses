"we had long lost sight of the sea shore behind the hills of bones . the rash professor , careless of losing his way , hurried me forward . we advanced in silence , bathed in luminous electric fluid . by some phenomenon which i am unable to explain , it lighted up all sides of every object equally . such was its diffusiveness , there being no central point from which the light emanated , that shadows no longer existed . you might have thought yourself under the rays of a vertical sun in a tropical region at noonday and the height of summer . no vapour was visible . the rocks , the distant mountains , a few isolated clumps of forest trees in the distance , presented a weird and wonderful aspect under these totally new conditions of a universal diffusion of light . we were like hoffmann 's shadowless man .",25

"i was left alone . but how was it possible for a man of my undecided turn of mind to argue successfully with so irascible a person as the professor ? with this persuasion i was hurrying away to my own little retreat upstairs , when the street door creaked upon its hinges ; heavy feet made the whole flight of stairs to shake ; and the master of the house , passing rapidly through the dining - room , threw himself in haste into his own sanctum . but on his rapid way he had found time to fling his hazel stick into a corner , his rough broadbrim upon the table , and these few emphatic words at his nephew :",36

"alice was not a bit hurt , and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment : she looked up , but it was all dark overhead ; before her was another long passage , and the white rabbit was still in sight , hurrying down it . there was not a moment to be lost : away went alice like the wind , and was just in time to hear it say , as it turned a corner , ' oh my ears and whiskers , how late it 's getting ! ' she was close behind it when she turned the corner , but the rabbit was no longer to be seen : she found herself in a long , low hall , which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof . there were doors all round the hall , but they were all locked ; and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other , trying every door , she walked sadly down the middle , wondering how she was ever to get out again .",46
"he had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them . even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bounded it . they must , he reflected , be awaiting him anxiously , for he had been absent nearly five hours . in the gladness of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re - echo to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming . he paused and listened for an answer . none came save his own cry , which clattered up the dreary silent ravines , and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions . again he shouted , even louder than before , and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago . a vague , nameless dread came over him , and he hurried onwards frantically , dropping the precious food in his agitation .",159
"it was all very well to say ' drink me , ' but the wise little alice was not going to do that in a hurry . ' no , i 'll look first , ' she said , ' and see whether it 's marked "" poison "" or not ' ; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt , and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things , all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them : such as , that a red - hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long ; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife , it usually bleeds ; and she had never forgotten that , if you drink much from a bottle marked ' poison , ' it is almost certain to disagree with you , sooner or later .",25
