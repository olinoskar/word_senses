"having rapidly taken notice of all this , i resumed the narrative of sir launcelot , which thus proceeded :",18

"the elder 's story became somewhat wearisome , and his audience grew gradually less , until it was reduced to twenty passengers . but this did not disconcert the enthusiast , who proceeded with the story of joseph smith 's bankruptcy in 1837 , and how his ruined creditors gave him a coat of tar and feathers ; his reappearance some years afterwards , more honourable and honoured than ever , at independence , missouri , the chief of a flourishing colony of three thousand disciples , and his pursuit thence by outraged gentiles , and retirement into the far west .",32
"thus day followed day ; and as sure as morning came he found that his unseen enemies had kept their register , and had marked up in some conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the month of grace . sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls , sometimes upon the floors , occasionally they were on small placards stuck upon the garden gate or the railings . with all his vigilance john ferrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded . a horror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of them . he became haggard and restless , and his eyes had the troubled look of some hunted creature . he had but one hope in life now , and that was for the arrival of the young hunter from nevada .",87
"the three composing our forlorn hope were deliberating whether they should proceed any further , when all at once a circle of smoke enveloped the giant of stone , and a dozen balls came whistling around d’artagnan and his companions .",11
"daylight appeared . the morning mists surrounded us , but they soon broke up . i was about to proceed with a careful examination of the hull , whose topside formed a sort of horizontal platform , when i felt it sinking little by little .",19
"going along the 55th meridian , the nautilus cut the antarctic circle on march 16 near eight o'clock in the morning . ice completely surrounded us and closed off the horizon . nevertheless , captain nemo went from passageway to passageway , always proceeding south .",43

"the train was about to start from allahabad , and mr . fogg proceeded to pay the guide the price agreed upon for his service , and not a farthing more ; which astonished passepartout , who remembered all that his master owed to the guide 's devotion . he had , indeed , risked his life in the adventure at pillaji , and , if he should be caught afterwards by the indians , he would with difficulty escape their vengeance . kiouni , also , must be disposed of . what should be done with the elephant , which had been so dearly purchased ? phileas fogg had already determined this question .",13
"in her turn , helen burns asked me to explain , and i proceeded forthwith to pour out , in my own way , the tale of my sufferings and resentments .",13
"a deathlike silence reigned under the vaulted roof , or at least in the anterior portion , for soon cyrus harding distinctly heard the rumbling which proceeded from the bowels of the mountain .",26
"the ' duncan ' yacht was equipped for the distant voyage , in which the nobleman 's family and the captain 's children wished to take part , and the ' duncan , ' leaving glasgow , proceeded towards the atlantic , passed through the straits of magellan , and ascended the pacific as far as patagonia , where , according to a previous interpretation of the document , they supposed that captain grant was a prisoner among the indians .",37
"hannah was evidently fond of talking . while i picked the fruit , and she made the paste for the pies , she proceeded to give me sundry details about her deceased master and mistress , and "" the childer , "" as she called the young people .",23
"the train entered the station , and passepartout jumping out first , was followed by mr . fogg , who assisted his fair companion to descend . phileas fogg intended to proceed at once to the hong kong steamer , in order to get aouda comfortably settled for the voyage . he was unwilling to leave her while they were still on dangerous ground .",31
i did so ; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing and commotion which was going on inside . the walls of his chest seemed to thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some powerful engine was at work . in the silence of the room i could hear a dull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source .,62
"i bent over him . not only was he sick , he was wounded . swathed in blood - soaked linen , his head was resting on a folded pillow . i undid the linen bandages , while the wounded man gazed with great staring eyes and let me proceed without making a single complaint .",49
"lord glenarvan , his wife , the two children , the major , the frenchman , captain mangles , and a few sailors composed the little band under the command of ayrton , while the ' duncan , ' under charge of the mate , tom austin , proceeded to melbourne , there to await lord glenarvan 's instructions .",48
"mr . fogg and his two companions took their places on a bench opposite the desks of the magistrate and his clerk . immediately after , judge obadiah , a fat , round man , followed by the clerk , entered . he proceeded to take down a wig which was hanging on a nail , and put it hurriedly on his head .",43
"since his abandonment , he had become , under the name of ben joyce , the leader of the escaped convicts ; and if he boldly maintained that the wreck had taken place on the east coast , and led lord glenarvan to proceed in that direction , it was that he hoped to separate him from his ship , seize the ' duncan , ' and make the yacht a pirate in the pacific .

"' i thought you did , ' said the mouse . ' --i proceed . "" edwin and morcar , the earls of mercia and northumbria , declared for him : and even stigand , the patriotic archbishop of canterbury , found it advisable-- "" '",13
"here a question popped into my head . how did the commander of this aquatic residence go about it ? did he obtain air using chemical methods , releasing the oxygen contained in potassium chlorate by heating it , meanwhile absorbing the carbon dioxide with potassium hydroxide ? if so , he would have to keep up some kind of relationship with the shore , to come by the materials needed for such an operation . did he simply limit himself to storing the air in high - pressure tanks and then dispense it according to his crew 's needs ? perhaps . or , proceeding in a more convenient , more economical , and consequently more probable fashion , was he satisfied with merely returning to breathe at the surface of the water like a cetacean , renewing his oxygen supply every twenty - four hours ? in any event , whatever his method was , it seemed prudent to me that he use this method without delay .",105
and the sailor and spilett immediately ran at full speed towards the spot from whence the cries proceeded .,17
"the priests took their places in front of the judge , and the clerk proceeded to read in a loud voice a complaint of sacrilege against phileas fogg and his servant , who were accused of having violated a place held consecrated by the brahmin religion .",14
"in short , the king , impatient , as has been said , had come by forced marches , and had that moment arrived with all his household and a reinforcement of ten thousand troops . his musketeers proceeded and followed him .",38

""" now , sir , proceed ; what did you do when you found she was mad ? """,5
"she hastened to ring the bell ; and when the tray came , she proceeded to arrange the cups , spoons , & c. , with assiduous celerity .",14
"the operation proceeded apace . yet there was one hitch . as they gradually unrolled this third cable , the electricians observed on several occasions that someone had recently driven nails into it , trying to damage its core . captain anderson , his officers , and the engineers put their heads together , then posted a warning that if the culprit were detected , he would be thrown overboard without a trial . after that , these villainous attempts were not repeated .",2
"nothing could be more simple . indeed , it was all so simple that fix and passepartout felt their hearts beating as if they would crack . they were listening for the whistle agreed upon , when suddenly savage cries resounded in the air , accompanied by reports which certainly did not issue from the car where the duellists were . the reports continued in front and the whole length of the train . cries of terror proceeded from the interior of the cars .",77
""" i mean,--what next ? how did you proceed ?",8
"the cries proceeded from two young women who were tripping disrobed along the mead , while two monkeys followed close at their heels biting at their limbs .",2
"i proceeded : at last my way opened , the trees thinned a little ; presently i beheld a railing , then the house -- scarce , by this dim light , distinguishable from the trees ; so dank and green were its decaying walls .",1
"accordingly , that same evening milady commenced her journey . night overtook her ; she stopped , and slept at an inn . at five o’clock the next morning she again proceeded , and in three hours after entered bethune .",31
"they proceeded but slowly , frequently looking back ; but , in consequence of the inclination of the soil , the lava gained rapidly in the east , and as its lower waves became solidified others , at boiling heat , covered them immediately .",1
