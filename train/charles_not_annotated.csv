"finishing his investigations , dillon stayed at the site of the casualty until the month of october . then he left vanikoro , headed toward new zealand , dropped anchor at calcutta on april 7 , 1828 , and returned to france , where he received a very cordial welcome from king charles x.",52
""" a dog ! "" said holmes . "" by jove , a curly - haired spaniel . poor mortimer will never see his pet again . well , i do not know that this place contains any secret which we have not already fathomed . he could hide his hound , but he could not hush its voice , and hence came those cries which even in daylight were not pleasant to hear . on an emergency he could keep the hound in the out - house at merripit , but it was always a risk , and it was only on the supreme day , which he regarded as the end of all his efforts , that he dared do it . this paste in the tin is no doubt the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed . it was suggested , of course , by the story of the family hell - hound , and by the desire to frighten old sir charles to death . no wonder the poor devil of a convict ran and screamed , even as our friend did , and as we ourselves might have done , when he saw such a creature bounding through the darkness of the moor upon his track . it was a cunning device , for , apart from the chance of driving your victim to his death , what peasant would venture to inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight of it , as many have done , upon the moor ? i said it in london , watson , and i say it again now , that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more dangerous man than he who is lying yonder""--he swept his long arm towards the huge mottled expanse of green - splotched bog which stretched away until it merged into the russet slopes of the moor .",167

"how different it was with material things ! where had they passed to ? where was the great crocus - coloured robe , on which the gods fought against the giants , that had been worked by brown girls for the pleasure of athena ? where the huge velarium that nero had stretched across the colosseum at rome , that titan sail of purple on which was represented the starry sky , and apollo driving a chariot drawn by white , gilt - reined steeds ? he longed to see the curious table - napkins wrought for the priest of the sun , on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast ; the mortuary cloth of king chilperic , with its three hundred golden bees ; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the bishop of pontus and were figured with "" lions , panthers , bears , dogs , forests , rocks , hunters -- all , in fact , that a painter can copy from nature "" ; and the coat that charles of orleans once wore , on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning "" madame , je suis tout joyeux , "" the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread , and each note , of square shape in those days , formed with four pearls .",183
""" the circumstances connected with the death of sir charles can not be said to have been entirely cleared up by the inquest , but at least enough has been done to dispose of those rumours to which local superstition has given rise . there is no reason whatever to suspect foul play , or to imagine that death could be from any but natural causes . sir charles was a widower , and a man who may be said to have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind . in spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his personal tastes , and his indoor servants at baskerville hall consisted of a married couple named barrymore , the husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper . their evidence , corroborated by that of several friends , tends to show that sir charles 's health has for some time been impaired , and points especially to some affection of the heart , manifesting itself in changes of colour , breathlessness , and acute attacks of nervous depression . dr . james mortimer , the friend and medical attendant of the deceased , has given evidence to the same effect .",148

""" it seems natural , does it not ? and yet , consider that every baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate . i feel sure that if sir charles could have spoken with me before his death he would have warned me against bringing this , the last of the old race , and the heir to great wealth , to that deadly place . and yet it can not be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor , bleak country - side depends upon his presence . all the good work which has been done by sir charles will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the hall . i fear lest i should be swayed too much by my own obvious interest in the matter , and that is why i bring the case before you and ask for your advice .

"while cruising along only a few cable lengths from the underpinning of reao island , i marveled at the gigantic piece of work accomplished by these microscopic laborers . these walls were the express achievements of madrepores known by the names fire coral , finger coral , star coral , and stony coral . these polyps grow exclusively in the agitated strata at the surface of the sea , and so it 's in the upper reaches that they begin these substructures , which sink little by little together with the secreted rubble binding them . this , at least , is the theory of mr . charles darwin , who thus explains the formation of atolls -- a theory superior , in my view , to the one that says these madreporic edifices sit on the summits of mountains or volcanoes submerged a few feet below sea level .",107
