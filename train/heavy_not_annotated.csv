"passing near these unusual animals , i could examine them at my leisure since they did n't stir . their hides were rough and heavy , a tan color leaning toward a reddish brown ; their coats were short and less than abundant . some were four meters long . more tranquil and less fearful than their northern relatives , they posted no sentinels on guard duty at the approaches to their campsite .",24

"a few moments afterwards the footlights flared up and the curtain rose on the third act . dorian gray went back to his seat . he looked pale , and proud , and indifferent . the play dragged on , and seemed interminable . half of the audience went out , tramping in heavy boots and laughing . the whole thing was a fiasco . the last act was played to almost empty benches . the curtain went down on a titter and some groans .",53

"as the dawn was just breaking , he found himself close to covent garden . the darkness lifted , and , flushed with faint fires , the sky hollowed itself into a perfect pearl . huge carts filled with nodding lilies rumbled slowly down the polished empty street . the air was heavy with the perfume of the flowers , and their beauty seemed to bring him an anodyne for his pain . he followed into the market and watched the men unloading their waggons . a white - smocked carter offered him some cherries . he thanked him , wondered why he refused to accept any money for them , and began to eat them listlessly . they had been plucked at midnight , and the coldness of the moon had entered into them .",52

"i was left alone . but how was it possible for a man of my undecided turn of mind to argue successfully with so irascible a person as the professor ? with this persuasion i was hurrying away to my own little retreat upstairs , when the street door creaked upon its hinges ; heavy feet made the whole flight of stairs to shake ; and the master of the house , passing rapidly through the dining - room , threw himself in haste into his own sanctum . but on his rapid way he had found time to fling his hazel stick into a corner , his rough broadbrim upon the table , and these few emphatic words at his nephew :",54

"passepartout was crushed ; it overwhelmed him to lose the boat by three - quarters of an hour . it was his fault , for , instead of helping his master , he had not ceased putting obstacles in his path ! and when he recalled all the incidents of the tour , when he counted up the sums expended in pure loss and on his own account , when he thought that the immense stake , added to the heavy charges of this useless journey , would completely ruin mr . fogg , he overwhelmed himself with bitter self - accusations . mr . fogg , however , did not reproach him ; and , on leaving the cunard pier , only said : "" we will consult about what is best to - morrow . come .

""" women are not always allowed a choice , "" he answered , but hardly had he finished the sentence before from the far end of the conservatory came a stifled groan , followed by the dull sound of a heavy fall . everybody started up . the duchess stood motionless in horror . and with fear in his eyes , lord henry rushed through the flapping palms to find dorian gray lying face downwards on the tiled floor in a deathlike swoon .",40
"as we moved forward , i heard a kind of pitter - patter above my head . sometimes this noise increased and became a continuous crackle . i soon realized the cause . it was a heavy rainfall rattling on the surface of the waves . instinctively i worried that i might get soaked ! by water in the midst of water ! i could n't help smiling at this outlandish notion . but to tell the truth , wearing these heavy diving suits , you no longer feel the liquid element , you simply think you 're in the midst of air a little denser than air on land , that 's all .",36

"but i could n't linger . captain nemo , on familiar terms with these dreadful animals , no longer minded them . we arrived at a preliminary plateau where still other surprises were waiting for me . there picturesque ruins took shape , betraying the hand of man , not our creator . they were huge stacks of stones in which you could distinguish the indistinct forms of palaces and temples , now arrayed in hosts of blossoming zoophytes , and over it all , not ivy but a heavy mantle of algae and fucus plants .",89
"they walked side by side in the direction of the avenue for nearly fifty yards without speaking . then dorian looked at lord henry and said , with a heavy sigh , "" it is a bad omen , harry , a very bad omen . """,29
"then , following the captain 's example , i let myself be crowned with my heavy copper sphere , and our air tanks immediately went into action .",15
"these were the historical memories that captain nemo 's scrawl sent rushing through my mind . thus , led by the strangest of fates , i was treading underfoot one of the mountains of that continent ! my hands were touching ruins many thousands of years old , contemporary with prehistoric times ! i was walking in the very place where contemporaries of early man had walked ! my heavy soles were crushing the skeletons of animals from the age of fable , animals that used to take cover in the shade of these trees now turned to stone !",69

"then came a new development . i had drawn you as paris in dainty armour , and as adonis with huntsman 's cloak and polished boar- spear . crowned with heavy lotus - blossoms you had sat on the prow of adrian 's barge , gazing across the green turbid nile . you had leaned over the still pool of some greek woodland and seen in the water 's silent silver the marvel of your own face . and it had all been what art should be -- unconscious , ideal , and remote . one day , a fatal day i sometimes think , i determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are , not in the costume of dead ages , but in your own dress and in your own time . whether it was the realism of the method , or the mere wonder of your own personality , thus directly presented to me without mist or veil , i can not tell . but i know that as i worked at it , every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret .",30
"but we could n't stop . we had to follow the captain , who headed down trails seemingly known only to himself . the seafloor rose noticeably , and when i lifted my arms , sometimes they would pass above the surface of the sea . then the level of the oysterbank would lower unpredictably . often we went around tall , pointed rocks rising like pyramids . in their dark crevices huge crustaceans , aiming their long legs like heavy artillery , watched us with unblinking eyes , while underfoot there crept millipedes , bloodworms , aricia worms , and annelid worms , whose antennas and tubular tentacles were incredibly long .",80

"it was a poisonous book . the heavy odour of incense seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain . the mere cadence of the sentences , the subtle monotony of their music , so full as it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately repeated , produced in the mind of the lad , as he passed from chapter to chapter , a form of reverie , a malady of dreaming , that made him unconscious of the falling day and creeping shadows .",7
