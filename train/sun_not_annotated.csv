""" 192,000 years , my gallant conseil , which significantly extends the biblical days of creation . what 's more , the formation of coal-- in other words , the petrification of forests swallowed by floods-- and the cooling of basaltic rocks likewise call for a much longer period of time . i might add that those ' days ' in the bible must represent whole epochs and not literally the lapse of time between two sunrises , because according to the bible itself , the sun does n't date from the first day of creation . """,86
it was eight o'clock in the morning . we had four hours to ourselves before the sun could be productively observed . i guided our steps toward a huge bay that made a crescent - shaped incision in the granite cliffs along the beach .,16
"after examining this community of walruses , i decided to return in my tracks . it was eleven o'clock , and if captain nemo found conditions favorable for taking his sights , i wanted to be present at the operation . but i held no hopes that the sun would make an appearance that day . it was hidden from our eyes by clouds squeezed together on the horizon . apparently the jealous orb did n't want to reveal this inaccessible spot on the globe to any human being .",48
"in essence , it was precisely march 20 . tomorrow , the 21st , was the day of the equinox ; the sun would disappear below the horizon for six months not counting refraction , and after its disappearance the long polar night would begin . following the september equinox , the sun had emerged above the northerly horizon , rising in long spirals until december 21 . at that time , the summer solstice of these southernmost districts , the sun had started back down , and tomorrow it would cast its last rays .",81
"we had long lost sight of the sea shore behind the hills of bones . the rash professor , careless of losing his way , hurried me forward . we advanced in silence , bathed in luminous electric fluid . by some phenomenon which i am unable to explain , it lighted up all sides of every object equally . such was its diffusiveness , there being no central point from which the light emanated , that shadows no longer existed . you might have thought yourself under the rays of a vertical sun in a tropical region at noonday and the height of summer . no vapour was visible . the rocks , the distant mountains , a few isolated clumps of forest trees in the distance , presented a weird and wonderful aspect under these totally new conditions of a universal diffusion of light . we were like hoffmann 's shadowless man .",93
""" i use only my chronometer , "" captain nemo answered me . "" at noon tomorrow , march 21 , if , after accounting for refraction , the sun 's disk is cut exactly in half by the northern horizon , that will mean i 'm at the south pole . """,29
"it took us two hours to reach the summit of this half - crystal , half - basalt peak . from there our eyes scanned a vast sea , which scrawled its boundary line firmly against the background of the northern sky . at our feet : dazzling tracts of white . over our heads : a pale azure , clear of mists . north of us : the sun 's disk , like a ball of fire already cut into by the edge of the horizon . from the heart of the waters : jets of liquid rising like hundreds of magnificent bouquets . far off , like a sleeping cetacean : the nautilus . behind us to the south and east : an immense shore , a chaotic heap of rocks and ice whose limits we could n't see .",69
"a long line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips , and of yellow and red roses , defiled in front of him , threading their way through the huge , jade - green piles of vegetables . under the portico , with its grey , sun - bleached pillars , loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls , waiting for the auction to be over . others crowded round the swinging doors of the coffee - house in the piazza . the heavy cart - horses slipped and stamped upon the rough stones , shaking their bells and trappings . some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks . iris - necked and pink - footed , the pigeons ran about picking up seeds .",46
"what human power could restore me to the light of the sun by rending asunder the huge arches of rock which united over my head , buttressing each other with impregnable strength ? who could place my feet on the right path , and bring me back to my company ?",11
"he sat all night on his stool , starting at the least noise ; and when the first rays of the sun penetrated into his chamber , the dawn itself appeared to him to have taken funereal tints .",21
"these were the only words he uttered during the journey . aouda , cosily packed in furs and cloaks , was sheltered as much as possible from the attacks of the freezing wind . as for passepartout , his face was as red as the sun 's disc when it sets in the mist , and he laboriously inhaled the biting air . with his natural buoyancy of spirits , he began to hope again . they would reach new york on the evening , if not on the morning , of the 11th , and there was still some chances that it would be before the steamer sailed for liverpool .",45
"i do not think she will manage it ; and yet it might be managed ; and his wife might , i verily believe , be the very happiest woman the sun shines on . """,31
"at the said hour , cyrus marked this point , and putting in a line with the sun two trees which would serve him for marks , he thus obtained an invariable meridian for his ulterior operations .",17
""" sir , "" captain nemo said , showing me the instruments hanging on the walls of his stateroom , "" these are the devices needed to navigate the nautilus . here , as in the lounge , i always have them before my eyes , and they indicate my position and exact heading in the midst of the ocean . you 're familiar with some of them , such as the thermometer , which gives the temperature inside the nautilus ; the barometer , which measures the heaviness of the outside air and forecasts changes in the weather ; the humidistat , which indicates the degree of dryness in the atmosphere ; the storm glass , whose mixture decomposes to foretell the arrival of tempests ; the compass , which steers my course ; the sextant , which takes the sun 's altitude and tells me my latitude ; chronometers , which allow me to calculate my longitude ; and finally , spyglasses for both day and night , enabling me to scrutinize every point of the horizon once the nautilus has risen to the surface of the waves .

"the lad flushed up and , going to the window , looked out for a few moments on the green , flickering , sun - lashed garden . "" i owe a great deal to harry , basil , "" he said at last , "" more than i owe to you . you only taught me to be vain . """,23
the sun 's bright rays glanced through the trees .,1
""" our lighting equipment would be useless to us , "" the captain answered me . "" we wo n't be going very deep , and the sun 's rays will be sufficient to light our way . besides , it 's unwise to carry electric lanterns under these waves . their brightness might unexpectedly attract certain dangerous occupants of these waterways .

but i feel mine is not the existence to be long protracted under an indian sun . what then ?,15
""" i 'm not so certain they 'll find it , "" captain nemo replied icily . "" but be that as it may , you 're already familiar with the first use i 've found for this valuable force . it lights us , and with a uniformity and continuity not even possessed by sunlight . now , look at that clock : it 's electric , it runs with an accuracy rivaling the finest chronometers . i 've had it divided into twenty - four hours like italian clocks , since neither day nor night , sun nor moon , exist for me , but only this artificial light that i import into the depths of the seas ! see , right now it 's ten o'clock in the morning . """,98
"i heard one of your kind an hour ago , singing high over the wood : but its song had no music for me , any more than the rising sun had rays .",30
"the sun was already sending sufficient light under these waves . the tiniest objects remained visible . after ten minutes of walking , we were in five meters of water , and the terrain had become almost flat .",1
"they were hatched by the sun , and their number was naturally considerable , as each turtle can lay annually two hundred and fifty .",5
"that sharp peak might hence be considered as the gnomon of a vast sun dial , the shadow projected from which on a certain day would point out the road to the centre of the earth .",13
"but when we had ascended to an elevation of about 250 feet , we were stopped by insurmountable obstacles . the converging inside walls changed into overhangs , and our climb into a circular stroll . at this topmost level the vegetable kingdom began to challenge the mineral kingdom . shrubs , and even a few trees , emerged from crevices in the walls . i recognized some spurges that let their caustic , purgative sap trickle out . there were heliotropes , very remiss at living up to their sun - worshipping reputations since no sunlight ever reached them ; their clusters of flowers drooped sadly , their colors and scents were faded . here and there chrysanthemums sprouted timidly at the feet of aloes with long , sad , sickly leaves . but between these lava flows i spotted little violets that still gave off a subtle fragrance , and i confess that i inhaled it with delight . the soul of a flower is its scent , and those splendid water plants , flowers of the sea , have no souls !",90
""" so much the worse for the sun , monsieur . the sun will be wrong , then ! """,12
"this bird belonged to the finest of the eight species credited to papua and its neighboring islands . it was a "" great emerald , "" one of the rarest birds of paradise . it measured three decimeters long . its head was comparatively small , and its eyes , placed near the opening of its beak , were also small . but it offered a wonderful mixture of hues : a yellow beak , brown feet and claws , hazel wings with purple tips , pale yellow head and scruff of the neck , emerald throat , the belly and chest maroon to brown . two strands , made of a horn substance covered with down , rose over its tail , which was lengthened by long , very light feathers of wonderful fineness , and they completed the costume of this marvelous bird that the islanders have poetically named "" the sun bird .

"how different it was with material things ! where had they passed to ? where was the great crocus - coloured robe , on which the gods fought against the giants , that had been worked by brown girls for the pleasure of athena ? where the huge velarium that nero had stretched across the colosseum at rome , that titan sail of purple on which was represented the starry sky , and apollo driving a chariot drawn by white , gilt - reined steeds ? he longed to see the curious table - napkins wrought for the priest of the sun , on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast ; the mortuary cloth of king chilperic , with its three hundred golden bees ; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the bishop of pontus and were figured with "" lions , panthers , bears , dogs , forests , rocks , hunters -- all , in fact , that a painter can copy from nature "" ; and the coat that charles of orleans once wore , on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning "" madame , je suis tout joyeux , "" the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread , and each note , of square shape in those days , formed with four pearls .",101
"it seemed to me that , should he become the possessor of mr . oliver 's large fortune , he might do as much good with it as if he went and laid his genius out to wither , and his strength to waste , under a tropical sun .",48
"these wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the storm lasted , and indeed some time after ; but the next day the wind was abated , and the sea calmer , and i began to be a little inured to it ; however , i was very grave for all that day , being also a little sea - sick still ; but towards night the weather cleared up , the wind was quite over , and a charming fine evening followed ; the sun went down perfectly clear , and rose so the next morning ; and having little or no wind , and a smooth sea , the sun shining upon it , the sight was , as i thought , the most delightful that ever i saw .",112
"in the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the sierra blanco . as far as the eye can reach stretches the great flat plain - land , all dusted over with patches of alkali , and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes . on the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks , with their rugged summits flecked with snow . in this great stretch of country there is no sign of life , nor of anything appertaining to life . there is no bird in the steel - blue heaven , no movement upon the dull , grey earth — above all , there is absolute silence . listen as one may , there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness ; nothing but silence — complete and heart - subduing silence . it has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain . that is hardly true . looking down from the sierra blanco , one sees a pathway traced out across the desert , which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance . it is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers . here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun , and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali . approach , and examine them ! they are bones : some large and coarse , others smaller and more delicate . the former have belonged to oxen , and the latter to men . for fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside .",230
"now , the earth occupies one of the foci of the ellipse , and so at one point in its course is at its apogee , that is , at its farthest from the sun , and at another point it is at its perigee , or nearest to the sun .",50
"the train entered the defiles of the sutpour mountains , which separate the khandeish from bundelcund , towards evening . the next day sir francis cromarty asked passepartout what time it was ; to which , on consulting his watch , he replied that it was three in the morning . this famous timepiece , always regulated on the greenwich meridian , which was now some seventy - seven degrees westward , was at least four hours slow . sir francis corrected passepartout 's time , whereupon the latter made the same remark that he had done to fix ; and upon the general insisting that the watch should be regulated in each new meridian , since he was constantly going eastward , that is in the face of the sun , and therefore the days were shorter by four minutes for each degree gone over , passepartout obstinately refused to alter his watch , which he kept at london time . it was an innocent delusion which could harm no one .",130
"in journeying eastward he had gone towards the sun , and the days therefore diminished for him as many times four minutes as he crossed degrees in this direction . there are three hundred and sixty degrees on the circumference of the earth ; and these three hundred and sixty degrees , multiplied by four minutes , gives precisely twenty - four hours -- that is , the day unconsciously gained . in other words , while phileas fogg , going eastward , saw the sun pass the meridian eighty times , his friends in london only saw it pass the meridian seventy - nine times . this is why they awaited him at the reform club on saturday , and not sunday , as mr . fogg thought .",85
"i soon found the place i was in was not fit for my settlement , because it was upon a low , moorish ground , near the sea , and i believed it would not be wholesome , and more particularly because there was no fresh water near it ; so i resolved to find a more healthy and more convenient spot of ground . i consulted several things in my situation , which i found would he proper for me : 1st , health and fresh water , i just now mentioned ; 2ndly , shelter from the heat of the sun ; 3rdly , security from ravenous creatures , whether man or beast ; 4thly , a view to the sea , that if god sent any ship in sight , i might not lose any advantage for my deliverance , of which i was not willing to banish all my expectation yet .",102
"we say the gravel he trod under his feet , for d’artagnan made these reflections while walking solitarily along a pretty little road which led from the camp to the village of angoutin . now , these reflections had led him further than he intended , and the day was beginning to decline when , by the last ray of the setting sun , he thought he saw the barrel of a musket glitter from behind a hedge .",62
"_ tuesday , august 18 . _ --evening came , or rather the time came when sleep weighs down the weary eyelids , for there is no night here , and the ceaseless light wearies the eyes with its persistency just as if we were sailing under an arctic sun . hans was at the helm . during his watch i slept .",49
"the horizon was beautifully clear , and the sea , undulating under a soft breeze , was as calm as the waters of a lake , sparkling here and there under the sun 's rays .",32
"passepartout , about nine o'clock , went out upon the platform to take the air . the weather was cold , the heavens grey , but it was not snowing . the sun 's disc , enlarged by the mist , seemed an enormous ring of gold , and passepartout was amusing himself by calculating its value in pounds sterling , when he was diverted from this interesting study by a strange - looking personage who made his appearance on the platform .",32
"indeed , larger blocks of ice soon appeared , their brilliance varying at the whim of the mists . some of these masses displayed green veins , as if scrawled with undulating lines of copper sulfate . others looked like enormous amethysts , letting the light penetrate their insides . the latter reflected the sun 's rays from the thousand facets of their crystals . the former , tinted with a bright limestone sheen , would have supplied enough building material to make a whole marble town .",54
"i told you we shall be married in four weeks . the wedding is to take place quietly , in the church down below yonder ; and then i shall waft you away at once to town . after a brief stay there , i shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun : to french vineyards and italian plains ; and she shall see whatever is famous in old story and in modern record : she shall taste , too , of the life of cities ; and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison with others . """,53
"i say 150 meters , although i had no instruments for estimating this distance . but i knew that the sun 's rays , even in the clearest seas , could reach no deeper . so at precisely this point the darkness became profound . not a single object was visible past ten paces . consequently , i had begun to grope my way when suddenly i saw the glow of an intense white light . captain nemo had just activated his electric device . his companion did likewise . conseil and i followed suit . by turning a switch , i established contact between the induction coil and the glass spiral , and the sea , lit up by our four lanterns , was illuminated for a radius of twenty - five meters .",20
the beautiful sheet of water glittered through the trees under the rays of the sun .,14
"the sun had now completely risen , and the whole facade of granite house became illuminated by its rays ; but in the interior as well as on the exterior all was quiet and calm .",1
"our return journey began . captain nemo resumed the lead in our little band , always heading forward without hesitation . i noted that we did n't follow the same path in returning to the nautilus . this new route , very steep and hence very arduous , quickly took us close to the surface of the sea . but this return to the upper strata was n't so sudden that decompression took place too quickly , which could have led to serious organic disorders and given us those internal injuries so fatal to divers . with great promptness , the light reappeared and grew stronger ; and the refraction of the sun , already low on the horizon , again ringed the edges of various objects with the entire color spectrum .",112
""" ' you dog ! ' i said ; ' i have hunted you from salt lake city to st . petersburg , and you have always escaped me . now , at last your wanderings have come to an end , for either you or i shall never see to - morrow 's sun rise . ' he shrunk still further away as i spoke , and i could see on his face that he thought i was mad . so i was for the time . the pulses in my temples beat like sledge - hammers , and i believe i would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and relieved me .",54
"immediately eight swords glittered in the rays of the setting sun , and the combat began with an animosity very natural between men twice enemies .",10
"in the midst of the watery mass , brightly lit by our electric beams , there snaked past those one - meter lampreys that are common to nearly every clime . a type of ray from the genus oxyrhynchus , five feet wide , had a white belly with a spotted , ash - gray back and was carried along by the currents like a huge , wide - open shawl . other rays passed by so quickly i could n't tell if they deserved that name "" eagle ray "" coined by the ancient greeks , or those designations of "" rat ray , "" "" bat ray , "" and "" toad ray "" that modern fishermen have inflicted on them . dogfish known as topes , twelve feet long and especially feared by divers , were racing with each other . looking like big bluish shadows , thresher sharks went by , eight feet long and gifted with an extremely acute sense of smell . dorados from the genus sparus , some measuring up to thirteen decimeters , appeared in silver and azure costumes encircled with ribbons , which contrasted with the dark color of their fins ; fish sacred to the goddess venus , their eyes set in brows of gold ; a valuable species that patronizes all waters fresh or salt , equally at home in rivers , lakes , and oceans , living in every clime , tolerating any temperature , their line dating back to prehistoric times on this earth yet preserving all its beauty from those far - off days . magnificent sturgeons , nine to ten meters long and extremely fast , banged their powerful tails against the glass of our panels , showing bluish backs with small brown spots ; they resemble sharks , without equaling their strength , and are encountered in every sea ; in the spring they delight in swimming up the great rivers , fighting the currents of the volga , danube , po , rhine , loire , and oder , while feeding on herring , mackerel , salmon , and codfish ; although they belong to the class of cartilaginous fish , they rate as a delicacy ; they 're eaten fresh , dried , marinated , or salt - preserved , and in olden times they were borne in triumph to the table of the roman epicure lucullus . but whenever the nautilus drew near the surface , those denizens of the mediterranean i could observe most productively belonged to the sixty - third genus of bony fish . these were tuna from the genus scomber , blue - black on top , silver on the belly armor , their dorsal stripes giving off a golden gleam . they are said to follow ships in search of refreshing shade from the hot tropical sun , and they did just that with the nautilus , as they had once done with the vessels of the count de la pérouse . for long hours they competed in speed with our submersible . i could n't stop marveling at these animals so perfectly cut out for racing , their heads small , their bodies sleek , spindle - shaped , and in some cases over three meters long , their pectoral fins gifted with remarkable strength , their caudal fins forked . like certain flocks of birds , whose speed they equal , these tuna swim in triangle formation , which prompted the ancients to say they 'd boned up on geometry and military strategy . and yet they ca n't escape the provençal fishermen , who prize them as highly as did the ancient inhabitants of turkey and italy ; and these valuable animals , as oblivious as if they were deaf and blind , leap right into the marseilles tuna nets and perish by the thousands .",480
