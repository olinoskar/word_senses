"the journey was resumed at six in the morning ; the guide hoped to reach allahabad by evening . in that case , mr . fogg would only lose a part of the forty - eight hours saved since the beginning of the tour . kiouni , resuming his rapid gait , soon descended the lower spurs of the vindhias , and towards noon they passed by the village of kallenger , on the cani , one of the branches of the ganges . the guide avoided inhabited places , thinking it safer to keep the open country , which lies along the first depressions of the basin of the great river . allahabad was now only twelve miles to the north - east . they stopped under a clump of bananas , the fruit of which , as healthy as bread and as succulent as cream , was amply partaken of and appreciated .",55
"_ oct . _ 25.âit rained all night and all day , with some gusts of wind ; during which time the ship broke in pieces , the wind blowing a little harder than before , and was no more to be seen , except the wreck of her , and that only at low water . i spent this day in covering and securing the goods which i had saved , that the rain might not spoil them .",54

"i drew aside my curtains before i went to bed and looked out from my window . it opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of the hall door . beyond , two copses of trees moaned and swung in a rising wind . a half moon broke through the rifts of racing clouds . in its cold light i saw beyond the trees a broken fringe of rocks , and the long , low curve of the melancholy moor . i closed the curtain , feeling that my last impression was in keeping with the rest .",76

"a whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity ; for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind ; and the exceeding density of the clouds ( which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house ) did not prevent our perceiving the life - like velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other , without passing away into the distance .",36

"here again i paused abruptly , and now with a feeling of wild amazement â for there could be no doubt whatever that , in this instance , i did actually hear ( although from what direction it proceeded i found it impossible to say ) a low and apparently distant , but harsh , protracted , and most unusual screaming or grating sound â the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon âs unnatural shriek as described by the romancer .",47

"they had to profit by the low tide to cross the channel , and it was agreed that they would construct , for this purpose , as well as they could , a boat which would render communication so much easier , and would also permit them to ascend the mercy , at the time of their grand exploration of the southwest of the island , which was put off till the first fine days .",6

"as we approach nearer the dimensions of the liquid column become magnificent . the islet resembles , with a most deceiving likeness , an enormous cetacean , whose head dominates the waves at a height of twenty yards . the geyser , a word meaning ' fury , ' rises majestically from its extremity . deep and heavy explosions are heard from time to time , when the enormous jet , possessed with more furious violence , shakes its plumy crest , and springs with a bound till it reaches the lowest stratum of the clouds . it stands alone . no steam vents , no hot springs surround it , and all the volcanic power of the region is concentrated here . sparks of electric fire mingle with the dazzling sheaf of lighted fluid , every drop of which refracts the prismatic colours .",91
"i had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard -- turned its angle : there was a gate just there , opening into the meadow , between two stone pillars crowned by stone balls .",5
"under these conditions the barometer generally stayed quite low . it fell as far as 73.5 centimeters . our compass indications no longer offered any guarantees . the deranged needles would mark contradictory directions as we approached the southern magnetic pole , which does n't coincide with the south pole proper . in fact , according to the astronomer hansteen , this magnetic pole is located fairly close to latitude 70 degrees and longitude 130 degrees , or abiding by the observations of louis - isidore duperrey , in longitude 135 degrees and latitude 70 degrees 30 ' . hence we had to transport compasses to different parts of the ship , take many readings , and strike an average . often we could chart our course only by guesswork , a less than satisfactory method in the midst of these winding passageways whose landmarks change continuously .",8
"on the declivity of the atlantic basin the first streams , branches of the north platte river , already appeared . the whole northern and eastern horizon was bounded by the immense semi - circular curtain which is formed by the southern portion of the rocky mountains , the highest being laramie peak . between this and the railway extended vast plains , plentifully irrigated . on the right rose the lower spurs of the mountainous mass which extends southward to the sources of the arkansas river , one of the great tributaries of the missouri .",71

"alice was not a bit hurt , and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment : she looked up , but it was all dark overhead ; before her was another long passage , and the white rabbit was still in sight , hurrying down it . there was not a moment to be lost : away went alice like the wind , and was just in time to hear it say , as it turned a corner , ' oh my ears and whiskers , how late it 's getting ! ' she was close behind it when she turned the corner , but the rabbit was no longer to be seen : she found herself in a long , low hall , which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof . there were doors all round the hall , but they were all locked ; and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other , trying every door , she walked sadly down the middle , wondering how she was ever to get out again .",124
"suddenly she came upon a little three - legged table , all made of solid glass ; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key , and alice 's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall ; but , alas ! either the locks were too large , or the key was too small , but at any rate it would not open any of them . however , on the second time round , she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before , and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high : she tried the little golden key in the lock , and to her great delight it fitted !",89
"on the 11th we reached cape portland . the clear open weather gave us a good view of myrdals jokul , which overhangs it . the cape is merely a low hill with steep sides , standing lonely by the beach .",30
"for some minutes i am still contemplating the geyser . i notice that it throws up its column of water with variable force : sometimes sending it to a great height , then again to a lower , which i attribute to the variable pressure of the steam accumulated in its reservoir .",36
"near this dwelling of mine , but a little farther within the land , and upon lower ground , lay my two pieces of corn land , which i kept duly cultivated and sowed , and which duly yielded me their harvest in its season ; and whenever i had occasion for more corn , i had more land adjoining as fit as that .",16

"a long , low moan , indescribably sad , swept over the moor . it filled the whole air , and yet it was impossible to say whence it came . from a dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar , and then sank back into a melancholy , throbbing murmur once again . stapleton looked at me with a curious expression in his face .",3

"soon , scarcely blurred by their distance from us , the forms of some objects took shape before my eyes . i recognized the lower slopes of some magnificent rocks carpeted by the finest zoophyte specimens , and right off , i was struck by an effect unique to this medium .",24
"after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance , and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming . it was the white rabbit returning , splendidly dressed , with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other : he came trotting along in a great hurry , muttering to himself as he came , ' oh ! the duchess , the duchess ! oh ! wo n't she be savage if i 've kept her waiting ! ' alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one ; so , when the rabbit came near her , she began , in a low , timid voice , ' if you please , sir-- ' the rabbit started violently , dropped the white kid gloves and the fan , and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go .",123

"that 's how we ended this conversation , which later was to have such serious consequences . at first , i must say , events seemed to confirm my forecasts , much to the canadian 's despair . did captain nemo view us with distrust in these heavily traveled seas , or did he simply want to hide from the sight of those ships of every nation that plowed the mediterranean ? i have no idea , but usually he stayed in midwater and well out from any coast . either the nautilus surfaced only enough to let its pilothouse emerge , or it slipped away to the lower depths , although , between the greek islands and asia minor , we did n't find bottom even at 2,000 meters down .",108

"so she called softly after it , ' mouse dear ! do come back again , and we wo n't talk about cats or dogs either , if you do n't like them !

"but the skies became more and more threatening . there were conspicuous signs of a hurricane on the way . the atmosphere was turning white and milky . slender sheaves of cirrus clouds were followed on the horizon by layers of nimbocumulus . other low clouds fled swiftly . the sea grew towering , inflated by long swells . every bird had disappeared except a few petrels , friends of the storms . the barometer fell significantly , indicating a tremendous tension in the surrounding haze . the mixture in our stormglass decomposed under the influence of the electricity charging the air . a struggle of the elements was approaching .",44
"it has split the lower part of the hull , instead of blowing up the deck and topsides !",4
"our return journey began . captain nemo resumed the lead in our little band , always heading forward without hesitation . i noted that we did n't follow the same path in returning to the nautilus . this new route , very steep and hence very arduous , quickly took us close to the surface of the sea . but this return to the upper strata was n't so sudden that decompression took place too quickly , which could have led to serious organic disorders and given us those internal injuries so fatal to divers . with great promptness , the light reappeared and grew stronger ; and the refraction of the sun , already low on the horizon , again ringed the edges of various objects with the entire color spectrum .",115

"this incident did not interrupt our walk . for two hours we were sometimes led over plains of sand , sometimes over prairies of seaweed that were quite arduous to cross . in all honesty , i was dead tired by the time i spotted a hazy glow half a mile away , cutting through the darkness of the waters . it was the nautilus 's beacon . within twenty minutes we would be on board , and there i could breathe easy again -- because my tank 's current air supply seemed to be quite low in oxygen . but i was reckoning without an encounter that slightly delayed our arrival .",96

"equipped with picks , some ten men climbed onto the nautilus 's sides and cracked loose the ice around the ship 's lower plating , which was soon set free . this operation was swiftly executed because the fresh ice was still thin . we all reentered the interior . the main ballast tanks were filled with the water that had n't yet congealed at our line of flotation . the nautilus submerged without delay .",22

"i reentered my stateroom , very puzzled , as you can imagine . i tried in vain to fall asleep . i kept searching for a relationship between the appearance of the diver and that chest filled with gold . soon , from certain rolling and pitching movements , i sensed that the nautilus had left the lower strata and was back on the surface of the water .",57
