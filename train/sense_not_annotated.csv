i took a book -- some arabian tales ; i sat down and endeavoured to read . i could make no sense of the subject ; my own thoughts swam always between me and the page i had usually found fascinating .,21
""" keep to common sense , st . john : you are verging on nonsense .",4
"i have told you that without being able to regain the complete exercise of my faculties , i retained the sense of my danger . i struggled , then , with all my strength , and doubtless opposed , weak as i was , a long resistance , for i heard him cry out , ’ these miserable puritans !",20
no snivel!--no sentiment!--no regret ! i will endure only sense and resolution .,9
""" no : adele is not answerable for either her mother 's faults or yours : i have a regard for her ; and now that i know she is , in a sense , parentless -- forsaken by her mother and disowned by you , sir -- i shall cling closer to her than before .",33
"i , for instance , am but dust and ashes . with st . paul , i acknowledge myself the chiefest of sinners ; but i do not suffer this sense of my personal vileness to daunt me .",30
""" no matter -- a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the distance . """,8
"those piles of stones just mentioned were laid out on the ocean floor with a distinct but inexplicable symmetry . i spotted gigantic furrows trailing off into the distant darkness , their length incalculable . there also were other peculiarities i could n't make sense of . it seemed to me that my heavy lead soles were crushing a litter of bones that made a dry crackling noise . so what were these vast plains we were now crossing ? i wanted to ask the captain , but i still did n't grasp that sign language that allowed him to chat with his companions when they went with him on his underwater excursions .",44
"i heard voices , too , speaking with a hollow sound , and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water : agitation , uncertainty , and an all - predominating sense of terror confused my faculties .",33
""" i believe the queen to have too high a sense of her duty , sire . """,10
at that moment mme . bonacieux recovered her senses .,8
"have you no sense to devise a system which will make you independent of all efforts , and all wills , but your own ?",3
"half lying on a couch in the library , i was suffocating . my face was purple , my lips blue , my faculties in abeyance . i could no longer see or hear . i had lost all sense of time . my muscles had no power to contract .",39
""" oh , my god ! my senses fail me amid such a chaos of iniquities .",7
"i now gently assured her that i was the person she supposed and desired me to be : and seeing that i was understood , and that her senses were quite collected , i explained how bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from thornfield .",28
""" not it : she will be a restraint . "" he was quite peremptory , both in look and voice . the chill of mrs . fairfax 's warnings , and the damp of her doubts were upon me : something of unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes . i half lost the sense of power over him .",55
""" bah ! "" he replied . "" nothing 's out there , professor aronnax , and if there is some animal , what chance would we have of spotting it ? ca n't you see we 're just wandering around at random ? people say they 've sighted this slippery beast again in the pacific high seas-- i 'm truly willing to believe it , but two months have already gone by since then , and judging by your narwhale 's personality , it hates growing moldy from hanging out too long in the same waterways ! it 's blessed with a terrific gift for getting around . now , professor , you know even better than i that nature does n't violate good sense , and she would n't give some naturally slow animal the ability to move swiftly if it had n't a need to use that talent . so if the beast does exist , it 's already long gone ! """,125
""" then in spite of my cries , in spite of my resistance -- for i began to comprehend that there was a question of something worse than death -- the executioner seized me , threw me on the floor , fastened me with his bonds , and suffocated by sobs , almost without sense , invoking god , who did not listen to me , i uttered all at once a frightful cry of pain and shame . a burning fire , a red - hot iron , the iron of the executioner , was imprinted on my shoulder . """,54
"i can not see ! "" "" help , help , my friends ! her hands are icy cold , "" cried d’artagnan . "" she is ill ! great god , she is losing her senses ! """,36
"i was hard pressed by ned land 's common sense , and i felt myself losing ground . i no longer knew what arguments to put forward on my behalf .",9
"when we parted , she said : "" good - bye , cousin jane eyre ; i wish you well : you have some sense . """,24
"however , the event showed me i was a fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise .",13
suddenly i felt a mild jolt . i realized the nautilus had come to rest on the ocean floor . my alarm increased . the canadian 's signal had n't reached me . i longed to rejoin ned land and urge him to postpone his attempt . i sensed that we were no longer navigating under normal conditions .,48
""" when once i had pressed the frail shoulder , something new -- a fresh sap and sense -- stole into my frame .",17
"the canadian and i sat him up ; we massaged his contracted arms , and when he regained his five senses , that eternal classifier mumbled in a broken voice :",20
"he was talking , at the moment , to louisa and amy eshton . i wondered to see them receive with calm that look which seemed to me so penetrating : i expected their eyes to fall , their colour to rise under it ; yet i was glad when i found they were in no sense moved .",56
""" well , that ’s something , for i have not the shadow of one , "" said athos coolly ; "" but as to d’artagnan , gentlemen , the idea of belonging to ours has driven him out of his senses . a thousand livres ! for my part , i declare i want two thousand . """,41
"ere i had finished this reply , my soul began to expand , to exult , with the strangest sense of freedom , of triumph , i ever felt .",19
"i still possessed my senses , though just now i could not speak .",4
""" in that sense i do feel apprehensive -- i have no wish to talk nonsense . """,3
""" if you did , it would be in such a grave , quiet manner , i should mistake it for sense .",21
