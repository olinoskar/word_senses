"towards midday the balloon was hovering above the sea at a height of only 2,000 feet . it contained 50,000 cubic feet of gas , and , thanks to its capacity , it could maintain itself a long time in the air , although it should reach a great altitude or might be thrown into a horizontal position .",18
"in the event of this , the cart would have been of more use than the light canoe , but it was heavy and clumsy to drag , and therefore more difficult to use ; this led pencroft to express his regret that the chest had not contained , besides "" his halfpound of tobacco , "" a pair of strong new jersey horses , which would have been very useful to the colony !",47
"there conseil 's work came to a halt . he did n't have time to finish off the class crustacea through an examination of its stomatopods , amphipods , homopods , isopods , trilobites , branchiopods , ostracods , and entomostraceans . and in order to complete his study of marine articulates , he needed to mention the class cirripedia , which contains water fleas and carp lice , plus the class annelida , which he would have divided without fail into tubifex worms and dorsibranchian worms . but having gone past the shallows of the strait of sicily , the nautilus resumed its usual deep - water speed . from then on , no more mollusks , no more zoophytes , no more articulates . just a few large fish sweeping by like shadows .",62

"if my eyes were able to range afar over this great sea , it was because a peculiar light brought to view every detail of it . it was not the light of the sun , with his dazzling shafts of brightness and the splendour of his rays ; nor was it the pale and uncertain shimmer of the moonbeams , the dim reflection of a nobler body of light . no ; the illuminating power of this light , its trembling diffusiveness , its bright , clear whiteness , and its low temperature , showed that it must be of electric origin . it was like an aurora borealis , a continuous cosmical phenomenon , filling a cavern of sufficient extent to contain an ocean .",123
"the colonists were then on the shore of an unimportant little harbor , which would scarcely have contained even two or three fishing - boats . it served as a neck to the new creek , of which the curious thing was that its waters , instead of joining the sea by a gentle slope , fell from a height of more than forty feet , which explained why the rising tide was not felt up the stream .",17
"it had been decided that a corral should be established near the sources of the red creek , at the foot of mount franklin , destined to contain the ruminants , whose presence would have been troublesome at granite house , and especially for the musmons , who were to supply the wool for the settlers ' winter garments .",27

"for years , dorian gray could not free himself from the influence of this book . or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never sought to free himself from it . he procured from paris no less than nine large - paper copies of the first edition , and had them bound in different colours , so that they might suit his various moods and the changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed , at times , to have almost entirely lost control . the hero , the wonderful young parisian in whom the romantic and the scientific temperaments were so strangely blended , became to him a kind of prefiguring type of himself . and , indeed , the whole book seemed to him to contain the story of his own life , written before he had lived it .",132
"on february 8 , as early as the first hours of daylight , mocha appeared before us : a town now in ruins , whose walls would collapse at the mere sound of a cannon , and which shelters a few leafy date trees here and there . this once - important city used to contain six public marketplaces plus twenty - six mosques , and its walls , protected by fourteen forts , fashioned a three - kilometer girdle around it .",55

"the worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat as hearty a breakfast as possible before leaving the carnatic ; but , as he had been walking about all day , the demands of hunger were becoming importunate . he observed that the butchers stalls contained neither mutton , goat , nor pork ; and , knowing also that it is a sacrilege to kill cattle , which are preserved solely for farming , he made up his mind that meat was far from plentiful in yokohama -- nor was he mistaken ; and , in default of butcher 's meat , he could have wished for a quarter of wild boar or deer , a partridge , or some quails , some game or fish , which , with rice , the japanese eat almost exclusively . but he found it necessary to keep up a stout heart , and to postpone the meal he craved till the following morning . night came , and passepartout re - entered the native quarter , where he wandered through the streets , lit by vari - coloured lanterns , looking on at the dancers , who were executing skilful steps and boundings , and the astrologers who stood in the open air with their telescopes . then he came to the harbour , which was lit up by the resin torches of the fishermen , who were fishing from their boats .",46

"but there were ample signs that i had not come upon a false scent . this was certainly where the man lived . some blankets rolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which neolithic man had once slumbered . the ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate . beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket half - full of water . a litter of empty tins showed that the place had been occupied for some time , and i saw , as my eyes became accustomed to the checkered light , a pannikin and a half - full bottle of spirits standing in the corner . in the middle of the hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table , and upon this stood a small cloth bundle -- the same , no doubt , which i had seen through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy . it contained a loaf of bread , a tinned tongue , and two tins of preserved peaches . as i set it down again , after having examined it , my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it . i raised it , and this was what i read , roughly scrawled in pencil:--",161

"this sudden illumination of our cabin enabled me to examine its tiniest details . it contained only a table and five stools . its invisible door must have been hermetically sealed . not a sound reached our ears . everything seemed dead inside this boat . was it in motion , or stationary on the surface of the ocean , or sinking into the depths ? i could n't tell .",15

"the prediction of the mormon was only too well fulfilled . whether it was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which she had been forced , poor lucy never held up her head again , but pined away and died within a month . her sottish husband , who had married her principally for the sake of john ferrier 's property , did not affect any great grief at his bereavement ; but his other wives mourned over her , and sat up with her the night before the burial , as is the mormon custom . they were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning , when , to their inexpressible fear and astonishment , the door was flung open , and a savage - looking , weather - beaten man in tattered garments strode into the room . without a glance or a word to the cowering women , he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of lucy ferrier . stooping over her , he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead , and then , snatching up her hand , he took the wedding - ring from her finger .

"here a question popped into my head . how did the commander of this aquatic residence go about it ? did he obtain air using chemical methods , releasing the oxygen contained in potassium chlorate by heating it , meanwhile absorbing the carbon dioxide with potassium hydroxide ? if so , he would have to keep up some kind of relationship with the shore , to come by the materials needed for such an operation . did he simply limit himself to storing the air in high - pressure tanks and then dispense it according to his crew 's needs ? perhaps . or , proceeding in a more convenient , more economical , and consequently more probable fashion , was he satisfied with merely returning to breathe at the surface of the water like a cetacean , renewing his oxygen supply every twenty - four hours ? in any event , whatever his method was , it seemed prudent to me that he use this method without delay .",31
"in the zoophyte branch , class alcyonaria , one finds the order gorgonaria , which contains three groups : sea fans , isidian polyps , and coral polyps . it 's in this last that precious coral belongs , an unusual substance that , at different times , has been classified in the mineral , vegetable , and animal kingdoms . medicine to the ancients , jewelry to the moderns , it was n't decisively placed in the animal kingdom until 1694 , by peysonnel of marseilles .",15

"in an hour we had reached the islet . two hours later we had completed a full circle around it . it measured four to five miles in circumference . a narrow channel separated it from a considerable shore , perhaps a continent whose limits we could n't see . the existence of this shore seemed to bear out commander maury 's hypotheses . in essence , this ingenious american has noted that between the south pole and the 60th parallel , the sea is covered with floating ice of dimensions much greater than any found in the north atlantic . from this fact he drew the conclusion that the antarctic circle must contain considerable shores , since icebergs ca n't form on the high seas but only along coastlines . according to his calculations , this frozen mass enclosing the southernmost pole forms a vast ice cap whose width must reach 4,000 kilometers .",113
