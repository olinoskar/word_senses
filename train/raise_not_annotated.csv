"holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically . "" with two such men as yourself and lestrade upon the ground , there will not be much for a third party to find out , "" he said .",5
"the gentleman raised his eyes slowly from the nag to his cavalier , as if he required some time to ascertain whether it could be to him that such strange reproaches were addressed ; then , when he could not possibly entertain any doubt of the matter , his eyebrows slightly bent , and with an accent of irony and insolence impossible to be described , he replied to d’artagnan , "" i was not speaking to you , sir .

"the weather was bad during the latter days of the voyage . the wind , obstinately remaining in the north - west , blew a gale , and retarded the steamer . the rangoon rolled heavily and the passengers became impatient of the long , monstrous waves which the wind raised before their path .",50
"what has happened to you today , to raise all these melancholy ideas ? """,8
"gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand . at his call they entered the room , and the stranger was lifted and carried out . as they raised him , a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor . lestrade grabbed it up and stared at it with mystified eyes .",29
"on february 10 , 1828 , the new astrolabe hove before tikopia island , took on a guide and interpreter in the person of a deserter who had settled there , plied a course toward vanikoro , raised it on february 12 , sailed along its reefs until the 14th , and only on the 20th dropped anchor inside its barrier in the harbor of vana .",37
a wild look raised his brows -- crossed his features : he rose ; but he forebore yet .,3
"such being the case , i felt not a little surprised when he raised his head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping , and said--",13
at times it almost seemed as if an under - current raised these monstrous billows which thundered against the wall of granite house .,11
"as soon as they had passed over the mercy bridge , the engineer raised it and returned , intending to put into execution a project for the performance of which he wished to be alone .",13
"there mr . fogg examined a curious vehicle , a kind of frame on two long beams , a little raised in front like the runners of a sledge , and upon which there was room for five or six persons . a high mast was fixed on the frame , held firmly by metallic lashings , to which was attached a large brigantine sail . this mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist a jib - sail . behind , a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle . it was , in short , a sledge rigged like a sloop . during the winter , when the trains are blocked up by the snow , these sledges make extremely rapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another . provided with more sails than a cutter , and with the wind behind them , they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not superior to that of the express trains .",20

"on january 4 , two days after crossing the coral sea , we raised the coast of papua . on this occasion captain nemo told me that he intended to reach the indian ocean via the torres strait . this was the extent of his remarks . ned saw with pleasure that this course would bring us , once again , closer to european seas .",13
"the end of the bridge which rested on the right bank of the mercy was to be firm , but the other end on the left bank was to be movable , so that it might be raised by means of a counterpoise , as some canal bridges are managed .",37
"the juncture was favorable . the english , who require , above everything , good living in order to be good soldiers , only eating salt meat and bad biscuit , had many invalids in their camp . still further , the sea , very rough at this period of the year all along the sea coast , destroyed every day some little vessel ; and the shore , from the point of l’aiguillon to the trenches , was at every tide literally covered with the wrecks of pinnacles , roberges , and feluccas . the result was that even if the king ’s troops remained quietly in their camp , it was evident that some day or other , buckingham , who only continued in the isle from obstinacy , would be obliged to raise the siege .",135
the professor mused a few moments over this series of characters ; then raising his spectacles he pronounced :,13

"this treatment put candide out of all patience ; it is true , he had suffered misfortunes a thousand times more grievous , but the cool insolence of the judge , and the villainy of the skipper raised his choler and threw him into a deep melancholy .",37

"mme . coquenard drew the dish toward her , skillfully detached the two great black feet , which she placed upon her husband ’s plate , cut off the neck , which with the head she put on one side for herself , raised the wing for porthos , and then returned the bird otherwise intact to the servant who had brought it in , who disappeared with it before the musketeer had time to examine the variations which disappointment produces upon faces , according to the characters and temperaments of those who experience it .",43
cyrus harding and the reporter raised herbert 's mattress and placed it on the bottom of the cart .,5
"without doubt captain nemo heard cyrus harding 's reply , for he raised himself slightly , and in a voice more feeble , but always intelligible,--",12
"ayrton alone , by a supreme effort , from time to time raised his head , and cast a despairing glance over the desert ocean .",12
"passepartout 's visage darkened with the skies , and for two days the poor fellow experienced constant fright . but phileas fogg was a bold mariner , and knew how to maintain headway against the sea ; and he kept on his course , without even decreasing his steam . the henrietta , when she could not rise upon the waves , crossed them , swamping her deck , but passing safely . sometimes the screw rose out of the water , beating its protruding end , when a mountain of water raised the stern above the waves ; but the craft always kept straight ahead .",92
"he hoped , then , in a conversation with anne of austria , to obtain some information from that conversation , and afterward to come upon his eminence with some secret which the cardinal either knew or did not know , but which , in either case , would raise him infinitely in the eyes of his minister .",49
"she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the march hare : she thought it must be the right house , because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur . it was so large a house , that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom , and raised herself to about two feet high : even then she walked up towards it rather timidly , saying to herself ' suppose it should be raving mad after all ! i almost wish i 'd gone to see the hatter instead !

"this attack , which might have had such serious consequences , was a lesson to the settlers , who from this time never went to bed until one of their number had made sure that all the bridges were raised , and that no invasion was possible .",39
"nothing was easier , since if the level of the lake was raised two or three feet , the opening would be quite beneath it .",12

"the bank was raised a little above the level of the sea , and on this luxuriant soil , supported by a granite base , the fine forest trees seemed to be as firmly planted as in the interior of the island .",3
herbert recognized the males by the two wing - like appendages raised on the neck .,11

"candide , thus driven out of this terrestrial paradise , rambled a long time without knowing where he went ; sometimes he raised his eyes , all bedewed with tears , towards heaven , and sometimes he cast a melancholy look towards the magnificent castle , where dwelt the fairest of young baronesses . he laid himself down to sleep in a furrow , heartbroken , and supperless .",22

"after leaving this gulf we raised muscat for an instant , the most important town in the country of oman . i marveled at its strange appearance in the midst of the black rocks surrounding it , against which the white of its houses and forts stood out sharply . i spotted the rounded domes of its mosques , the elegant tips of its minarets , and its fresh , leafy terraces . but it was only a fleeting vision , and the nautilus soon sank beneath the dark waves of these waterways .",5
"i approached my cheek to her lips : she would not touch it . she said i oppressed her by leaning over the bed , and again demanded water . as i laid her down -- for i raised her and supported her on my arm while she drank -- i covered her ice - cold and clammy hand with mine : the feeble fingers shrank from my touch -- the glazing eyes shunned my gaze .",38

"raising his sextant , captain nemo took the altitude of the sun , which would give him his latitude . he waited for a few minutes until the orb touched the rim of the horizon . while he was taking his sights , he did n't move a muscle , and the instrument could n't have been steadier in hands made out of marble .",0

"but , if he thought of these possibilities , he did not betray the fact by any outward sign . always the same impassible member of the reform club , whom no incident could surprise , as unvarying as the ship 's chronometers , and seldom having the curiosity even to go upon the deck , he passed through the memorable scenes of the red sea with cold indifference ; did not care to recognise the historic towns and villages which , along its borders , raised their picturesque outlines against the sky ; and betrayed no fear of the dangers of the arabic gulf , which the old historians always spoke of with horror , and upon which the ancient navigators never ventured without propitiating the gods by ample sacrifices . how did this eccentric personage pass his time on the mongolia ? he made his four hearty meals every day , regardless of the most persistent rolling and pitching on the part of the steamer ; and he played whist indefatigably , for he had found partners as enthusiastic in the game as himself .",86

"the next day , april 1 , when the nautilus rose to the surface of the waves a few minutes before noon , we raised land to the west . it was tierra del fuego , the land of fire , a name given it by early navigators after they saw numerous curls of smoke rising from the natives ' huts . this land of fire forms a huge cluster of islands over thirty leagues long and eighty leagues wide , extending between latitude 53 degrees and 56 degrees south , and between longitude 67 degrees 50 ' and 77 degrees 15 ' west . its coastline looked flat , but high mountains rose in the distance . i even thought i glimpsed mt . sarmiento , whose elevation is 2,070 meters above sea level : a pyramid - shaped block of shale with a very sharp summit , which , depending on whether it 's clear or veiled in vapor , "" predicts fair weather or foul , "" as ned land told me .",24
"cyrus harding did not hesitate to give utterance to the suggestions which this fact , at once surprising and unexpected , could not fail to raise in his mind .",25

"but there were ample signs that i had not come upon a false scent . this was certainly where the man lived . some blankets rolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which neolithic man had once slumbered . the ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate . beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket half - full of water . a litter of empty tins showed that the place had been occupied for some time , and i saw , as my eyes became accustomed to the checkered light , a pannikin and a half - full bottle of spirits standing in the corner . in the middle of the hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table , and upon this stood a small cloth bundle -- the same , no doubt , which i had seen through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy . it contained a loaf of bread , a tinned tongue , and two tins of preserved peaches . as i set it down again , after having examined it , my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it . i raised it , and this was what i read , roughly scrawled in pencil:--",210
"' hush ! hush ! ' said the rabbit in a low , hurried tone . he looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke , and then raised himself upon tiptoe , put his mouth close to her ear , and whispered ' she 's under sentence of execution . '",28
"that evil influence which carried me first away from my father ’s house — which hurried me into the wild and indigested notion of raising my fortune , and that impressed those conceits so forcibly upon me as to make me deaf to all good advice , and to the entreaties and even the commands of my father — i say , the same influence , whatever it was , presented the most unfortunate of all enterprises to my view ; and i went on board a vessel bound to the coast of africa ; or , as our sailors vulgarly called it , a voyage to guinea .",24
"the actual situation was this : on the islet were a dozen convicts , of whom some were no doubt wounded , but who had still a boat at their disposal ; on the island were six , but who could not by any possibility reach granite house , as they could not cross the river , all the bridges being raised .",61

"cyrus harding , therefore , resolved to proceed without any further delay to the fabrication of a strong rope ladder , which , once raised , would render granite house completely inaccessible .",24
"the framework of the partitions was soon raised , very roughly at first , and in a short time , the cave was divided into rooms and storehouses , according to the plan agreed upon .",7
"thus it had been agreed that cyrus harding , neb , and gideon spilett should remain at granite house , but an objection was raised , and spilett , who had not forgotten his business as reporter to the new york herald , having declared that he would go by swimming rather than lose such an opportunity , he was admitted to take a part in the voyage .",24
"“ xury , ” says i , “ you shall on shore and kill him . ” xury , looked frighted , and said , “ me kill ! he eat me at one mouth!”—one mouthful he meant . however , i said no more to the boy , but bade him lie still , and i took our biggest gun , which was almost musket - bore , and loaded it with a good charge of powder , and with two slugs , and laid it down ; then i loaded another gun with two bullets ; and the third ( for we had three pieces ) i loaded with five smaller bullets . i took the best aim i could with the first piece to have shot him in the head , but he lay so with his leg raised a little above his nose , that the slugs hit his leg about the knee and broke the bone . he started up , growling at first , but finding his leg broken , fell down again ; and then got upon three legs , and gave the most hideous roar that ever i heard . i was a little surprised that i had not hit him on the head ; however , i took up the second piece immediately , and though he began to move off , fired again , and shot him in the head , and had the pleasure to see him drop and make but little noise , but lie struggling for life . then xury took heart , and would have me let him go on shore .",141

"this projection , carefully leveled by the pickaxe , made a sort of platform , to which they fixed the first ladder , of which the oscillation was thus diminished one - half , and a rope permitted it to be raised to the level of granite house .",41
"just at this moment there was an unusual stir in the human mass . all the hands were raised in the air . some , tightly closed , seemed to disappear suddenly in the midst of the cries -- an energetic way , no doubt , of casting a vote . the crowd swayed back , the banners and flags wavered , disappeared an instant , then reappeared in tatters . the undulations of the human surge reached the steps , while all the heads floundered on the surface like a sea agitated by a squall . many of the black hats disappeared , and the greater part of the crowd seemed to have diminished in height .",18

"conseil made one final effort , and bracing his hands on my shoulders , while i offered resistance with one supreme exertion , he raised himself half out of the water , then fell back exhausted .",24
"nevertheless , conseil kept towing me . sometimes he looked up , stared straight ahead , and shouted a request for directions , which was answered by a voice that was getting closer and closer . i could barely hear it . i was at the end of my strength ; my fingers gave out ; my hands were no help to me ; my mouth opened convulsively , filling with brine ; its coldness ran through me ; i raised my head one last time , then i collapsed . . . .",80
"in consequence , after having traveled all night , at seven o’clock she was at the fort of the point ; at eight o’clock she had embarked ; and at nine , the vessel , which with letters of marque from the cardinal was supposed to be sailing for bayonne , raised anchor , and steered its course toward england .",51

"on january 13 , arriving in the timor sea , captain nemo raised the island of that name at longitude 122 degrees . this island , whose surface area measures 1,625 square leagues , is governed by rajahs . these aristocrats deem themselves the sons of crocodiles , in other words , descendants with the most exalted origins to which a human being can lay claim . accordingly , their scaly ancestors infest the island 's rivers and are the subjects of special veneration . they are sheltered , nurtured , flattered , pampered , and offered a ritual diet of nubile maidens ; and woe to the foreigner who lifts a finger against these sacred saurians .",12

"" she shall not be buried in that , "" he cried with a fierce snarl , and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone . so strange and so brief was the episode , that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it , had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared .",237
