"in that place the fiord was at least three english miles wide ; the waves rolled with a rushing din upon the sharp - pointed rocks ; this inlet was confined between walls of rock , precipices crowned by sharp peaks 2,000 feet high , and remarkable for the brown strata which separated the beds of reddish tuff . however much i might respect the intelligence of our quadrupeds , i hardly cared to put it to the test by trusting myself to it on horseback across an arm of the sea .",15

"night fell . a profound silence reigned on board . the compass indicated that the nautilus had n't changed direction . i could hear the beat of its propeller , churning the waves with steady speed . staying on the surface of the water , it rolled gently , sometimes to one side , sometimes to the other .",46

"mr . fogg was quite ready . under his arm might have been observed a red - bound copy of bradshaw 's continental railway steam transit and general guide , with its timetables showing the arrival and departure of steamers and railways . he took the carpet - bag , opened it , and slipped into it a goodly roll of bank of england notes , which would pass wherever he might go .",59
"we were now beginning to scale the steep sides of snæfell . its snowy summit , by an optical illusion not unfrequent in mountains , seemed close to us , and yet how many weary hours it took to reach it ! the stones , adhering by no soil or fibrous roots of vegetation , rolled away from under our feet , and rushed down the precipice below with the swiftness of an avalanche .",55

"in seeking to put our cargo into somewhat better order , i found that the greater part of the articles embarked had disappeared at the moment of the explosion , when the sea broke in upon us with such violence . i wanted to know exactly what we had saved , and with the lantern in my hand i began my examination . of our instruments none were saved but the compass and the chronometer ; our stock of ropes and ladders was reduced to the bit of cord rolled round the stump of the mast ! not a spade , not a pickaxe , not a hammer was left us ; and , irreparable disaster ! we had only one day 's provisions left .",89
"i had one morsel of bread yet : the remnant of a roll i had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a stray penny -- my last coin . i saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and there , like jet beads in the heath : i gathered a handful and ate them with the bread .",12

"but there were ample signs that i had not come upon a false scent . this was certainly where the man lived . some blankets rolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which neolithic man had once slumbered . the ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate . beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket half - full of water . a litter of empty tins showed that the place had been occupied for some time , and i saw , as my eyes became accustomed to the checkered light , a pannikin and a half - full bottle of spirits standing in the corner . in the middle of the hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table , and upon this stood a small cloth bundle -- the same , no doubt , which i had seen through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy . it contained a loaf of bread , a tinned tongue , and two tins of preserved peaches . as i set it down again , after having examined it , my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it . i raised it , and this was what i read , roughly scrawled in pencil:--",25

masses of rock were rolled to the entrance and strongly cemented together .,4
"those huge creatures attacked each other with the greatest animosity . they heaved around them liquid mountains , which rolled even to our raft and rocked it perilously . twenty times we were near capsizing . hissings of prodigious force are heard . the two beasts are fast locked together ; i can not distinguish the one from the other . the probable rage of the conqueror inspires us with intense fear .",19
"herbert and gideon spilett killed two kangaroos with bows and arrows , and also an animal which strongly resembled both a hedgehog and an ant - eater . it was like the first because it rolled itself into a ball , and bristled with spines , and the second because it had sharp claws , a long slender snout which terminated in a bird 's beak , and an extendible tongue , covered with little thorns which served to hold the insects .",35
it was possible that a few hours later the thunder would roll over the island itself .,11
"i spun around . captain nemo was standing before me , but i almost did n't recognize him . his facial features were transfigured . gleaming with dark fire , his eyes had shrunk beneath his frowning brow . his teeth were half bared . his rigid body , clenched fists , and head drawn between his shoulders , all attested to a fierce hate breathing from every pore . he did n't move . my spyglass fell from his hand and rolled at his feet .",82
"and if nothing happens without his knowledge , he knows that i am here , and am in this dreadful condition ; and if nothing happens without his appointment , he has appointed all this to befall me . nothing occurred to my thought to contradict any of these conclusions , and therefore it rested upon me with the greater force , that it must needs be that god had appointed all this to befall me ; that i was brought into this miserable circumstance by his direction , he having the sole power , not of me only , but of everything that happened in the world . immediately it followed : why has god done this to me ? what have i done to be thus used ? my conscience presently checked me in that inquiry , as if i had blasphemed , and methought it spoke to me like a voice : “ wretch ! dost _ thou _ ask what thou hast done ? look back upon a dreadful misspent life , and ask thyself what thou hast _ not _ done ? ask , why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed ? why wert thou not drowned in yarmouth roads ; killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the sallee man - of - war ; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of africa ; or drowned _ here _ , when all the crew perished but thyself ? dost _ thou _ ask , what have i done ? ” i was struck dumb with these reflections , as one astonished , and had not a word to say — no , not to answer to myself , but rose up pensive and sad , walked back to my retreat , and went up over my wall , as if i had been going to bed ; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed , and i had no inclination to sleep ; so i sat down in my chair , and lighted my lamp , for it began to be dark . now , as the apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me very much , it occurred to my thought that the brazilians take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers , and i had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests , which was quite cured , and some also that was green , and not quite cured .",398
"when i reopened them i saw my two companions motionless and rolled up in their coverings . were they asleep ? as for me , i could not get one moment 's sleep . i was suffering too keenly , and what embittered my thoughts was that there was no remedy . my uncle 's last words echoed painfully in my ears : "" it 's all over !

""" it do n't much matter to you why i hated these men , "" he said ; "" it 's enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings — a father and a daughter — and that they had , therefore , forfeited their own lives . after the lapse of time that has passed since their crime , it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court . i knew of their guilt though , and i determined that i should be judge , jury , and executioner all rolled into one . you 'd have done the same , if you have any manhood in you , if you had been in my place .",100
"as d’artagnan pursued his investigations , a more abundant and more icy sweat rolled in large drops from his forehead ; his heart was oppressed by a horrible anguish ; his respiration was broken and short . and yet he said , to reassure himself , that this pavilion perhaps had nothing in common with mme . bonacieux ; that the young woman had made an appointment with him before the pavilion , and not in the pavilion ; that she might have been detained in paris by her duties , or perhaps by the jealousy of her husband .",13
"among others i noted that sand goby mentioned by aristotle and commonly known by the name sea loach , which is encountered exclusively in the salty waters next to the nile delta . near them some semiphosphorescent red porgy rolled by , a variety of gilthead that the egyptians ranked among their sacred animals , lauding them in religious ceremonies when their arrival in the river 's waters announced the fertile flood season . i also noticed some wrasse known as the tapiro , three decimeters long , bony fish with transparent scales whose bluish gray color is mixed with red spots ; they 're enthusiastic eaters of marine vegetables , which gives them an exquisite flavor ; hence these tapiro were much in demand by the epicures of ancient rome , and their entrails were dressed with brains of peacock , tongue of flamingo , and testes of moray to make that divine platter that so enraptured the roman emperor vitellius .",39
