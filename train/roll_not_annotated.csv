"in that place the fiord was at least three english miles wide ; the waves rolled with a rushing din upon the sharp - pointed rocks ; this inlet was confined between walls of rock , precipices crowned by sharp peaks 2,000 feet high , and remarkable for the brown strata which separated the beds of reddish tuff . however much i might respect the intelligence of our quadrupeds , i hardly cared to put it to the test by trusting myself to it on horseback across an arm of the sea .",15
"gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand . at his call they entered the room , and the stranger was lifted and carried out . as they raised him , a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor . lestrade grabbed it up and stared at it with mystified eyes .",37

her beautiful face was distorted with agony ; her glassy eyes had no longer their sight ; a convulsive shuddering shook her whole body ; the sweat rolled from her brow .,27
"night fell . a profound silence reigned on board . the compass indicated that the nautilus had n't changed direction . i could hear the beat of its propeller , churning the waves with steady speed . staying on the surface of the water , it rolled gently , sometimes to one side , sometimes to the other .",46

"mr . fogg was quite ready . under his arm might have been observed a red - bound copy of bradshaw 's continental railway steam transit and general guide , with its timetables showing the arrival and departure of steamers and railways . he took the carpet - bag , opened it , and slipped into it a goodly roll of bank of england notes , which would pass wherever he might go .",59
"we were now beginning to scale the steep sides of sn√¶fell . its snowy summit , by an optical illusion not unfrequent in mountains , seemed close to us , and yet how many weary hours it took to reach it ! the stones , adhering by no soil or fibrous roots of vegetation , rolled away from under our feet , and rushed down the precipice below with the swiftness of an avalanche .",55

"in seeking to put our cargo into somewhat better order , i found that the greater part of the articles embarked had disappeared at the moment of the explosion , when the sea broke in upon us with such violence . i wanted to know exactly what we had saved , and with the lantern in my hand i began my examination . of our instruments none were saved but the compass and the chronometer ; our stock of ropes and ladders was reduced to the bit of cord rolled round the stump of the mast ! not a spade , not a pickaxe , not a hammer was left us ; and , irreparable disaster ! we had only one day 's provisions left .",89
"i had one morsel of bread yet : the remnant of a roll i had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a stray penny -- my last coin . i saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and there , like jet beads in the heath : i gathered a handful and ate them with the bread .",12
"it stupidly rolled its eyes , deeply buried in a thick bed of fat .",2
"then i remembered the theory of an english captain , who likened the earth to a vast hollow sphere , in the interior of which the air became luminous because of the vast pressure that weighed upon it ; while two stars , pluto and proserpine , rolled within upon the circuit of their mysterious orbits .",47

"but there were ample signs that i had not come upon a false scent . this was certainly where the man lived . some blankets rolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which neolithic man had once slumbered . the ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate . beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket half - full of water . a litter of empty tins showed that the place had been occupied for some time , and i saw , as my eyes became accustomed to the checkered light , a pannikin and a half - full bottle of spirits standing in the corner . in the middle of the hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table , and upon this stood a small cloth bundle -- the same , no doubt , which i had seen through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy . it contained a loaf of bread , a tinned tongue , and two tins of preserved peaches . as i set it down again , after having examined it , my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it . i raised it , and this was what i read , roughly scrawled in pencil:--",25

masses of rock were rolled to the entrance and strongly cemented together .,4
"those huge creatures attacked each other with the greatest animosity . they heaved around them liquid mountains , which rolled even to our raft and rocked it perilously . twenty times we were near capsizing . hissings of prodigious force are heard . the two beasts are fast locked together ; i can not distinguish the one from the other . the probable rage of the conqueror inspires us with intense fear .",19
"herbert and gideon spilett killed two kangaroos with bows and arrows , and also an animal which strongly resembled both a hedgehog and an ant - eater . it was like the first because it rolled itself into a ball , and bristled with spines , and the second because it had sharp claws , a long slender snout which terminated in a bird 's beak , and an extendible tongue , covered with little thorns which served to hold the insects .",35

"i spun around . captain nemo was standing before me , but i almost did n't recognize him . his facial features were transfigured . gleaming with dark fire , his eyes had shrunk beneath his frowning brow . his teeth were half bared . his rigid body , clenched fists , and head drawn between his shoulders , all attested to a fierce hate breathing from every pore . he did n't move . my spyglass fell from his hand and rolled at his feet .",82

"when i reopened them i saw my two companions motionless and rolled up in their coverings . were they asleep ? as for me , i could not get one moment 's sleep . i was suffering too keenly , and what embittered my thoughts was that there was no remedy . my uncle 's last words echoed painfully in my ears : "" it 's all over !

"as d‚Äôartagnan pursued his investigations , a more abundant and more icy sweat rolled in large drops from his forehead ; his heart was oppressed by a horrible anguish ; his respiration was broken and short . and yet he said , to reassure himself , that this pavilion perhaps had nothing in common with mme . bonacieux ; that the young woman had made an appointment with him before the pavilion , and not in the pavilion ; that she might have been detained in paris by her duties , or perhaps by the jealousy of her husband .",13
"among others i noted that sand goby mentioned by aristotle and commonly known by the name sea loach , which is encountered exclusively in the salty waters next to the nile delta . near them some semiphosphorescent red porgy rolled by , a variety of gilthead that the egyptians ranked among their sacred animals , lauding them in religious ceremonies when their arrival in the river 's waters announced the fertile flood season . i also noticed some wrasse known as the tapiro , three decimeters long , bony fish with transparent scales whose bluish gray color is mixed with red spots ; they 're enthusiastic eaters of marine vegetables , which gives them an exquisite flavor ; hence these tapiro were much in demand by the epicures of ancient rome , and their entrails were dressed with brains of peacock , tongue of flamingo , and testes of moray to make that divine platter that so enraptured the roman emperor vitellius .",39
