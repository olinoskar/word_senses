"there conseil 's work came to a halt . he did n't have time to finish off the class crustacea through an examination of its stomatopods , amphipods , homopods , isopods , trilobites , branchiopods , ostracods , and entomostraceans . and in order to complete his study of marine articulates , he needed to mention the class cirripedia , which contains water fleas and carp lice , plus the class annelida , which he would have divided without fail into tubifex worms and dorsibranchian worms . but having gone past the shallows of the strait of sicily , the nautilus resumed its usual deep - water speed . from then on , no more mollusks , no more zoophytes , no more articulates . just a few large fish sweeping by like shadows .",1

"to be sure , i had confidence in this devoted lad . ordinarily , i never asked whether or not it suited him to go with me on my journeys ; but this time an expedition was at issue that could drag on indefinitely , a hazardous undertaking whose purpose was to hunt an animal that could sink a frigate as easily as a walnut shell ! there was good reason to stop and think , even for the world 's most emotionless man . what would conseil say ?",87

i left conseil to the proper stowing of our luggage and climbed on deck to watch the preparations for getting under way .,2
"just then i was in the bow , leaning over the starboard rail . conseil , stationed beside me , stared straight ahead . roosting in the shrouds , the crew examined the horizon , which shrank and darkened little by little . officers were probing the increasing gloom with their night glasses . sometimes the murky ocean sparkled beneath moonbeams that darted between the fringes of two clouds . then all traces of light vanished into the darkness .",14

"so ned land had good reason to worry . in these wide seas empty of islands , it was no longer feasible to jump ship . nor did we have any way to counter captain nemo 's whims . we had no choice but to acquiesce ; but if we could n't attain our end through force or cunning , i liked to think we might achieve it through persuasion . once this voyage was over , might not captain nemo consent to set us free in return for our promise never to reveal his existence ? our word of honor , which we sincerely would have kept . however , this delicate question would have to be negotiated with the captain . but how would he receive our demands for freedom ? at the very outset and in no uncertain terms , had n't he declared that the secret of his life required that we be permanently imprisoned on board the nautilus ? would n't he see my four - month silence as a tacit acceptance of this situation ? would my returning to this subject arouse suspicions that could jeopardize our escape plans , if we had promising circumstances for trying again later on ? i weighed all these considerations , turned them over in my mind , submitted them to conseil , but he was as baffled as i was . in short , although i 'm not easily discouraged , i realized that my chances of ever seeing my fellow men again were shrinking by the day , especially at a time when captain nemo was recklessly racing toward the south atlantic !",223

"among other fowl i noted some sheathbills from the wading - bird family , the size of pigeons , white in color , the beak short and conical , the eyes framed by red circles . conseil laid in a supply of them , because when they 're properly cooked , these winged creatures make a pleasant dish . in the air there passed sooty albatross with four - meter wingspans , birds aptly dubbed "" vultures of the ocean , "" also gigantic petrels including several with arching wings , enthusiastic eaters of seal that are known as quebrantahuesos , and cape pigeons , a sort of small duck , the tops of their bodies black and white -- in short , a whole series of petrels , some whitish with wings trimmed in brown , others blue and exclusive to these antarctic seas , the former "" so oily , "" i told conseil , "" that inhabitants of the faroe islands simply fit the bird with a wick , then light it up .

"during our absence the nets had been spread , and i observed with fascination the fish just hauled on board . the antarctic seas serve as a refuge for an extremely large number of migratory fish that flee from storms in the subpolar zones , in truth only to slide down the gullets of porpoises and seals . i noted some one - decimeter southern bullhead , a species of whitish cartilaginous fish overrun with bluish gray stripes and armed with stings , then some antarctic rabbitfish three feet long , the body very slender , the skin a smooth silver white , the head rounded , the topside furnished with three fins , the snout ending in a trunk that curved back toward the mouth . i sampled its flesh but found it tasteless , despite conseil 's views , which were largely approving .",137

""" begging master 's pardon , "" conseil answered , "" but this seems more like the sommerard artifacts exhibition ! """,7
"conseil needed no encouraging . bending over the glass cases , the gallant lad was already muttering choice words from the naturalist 's vocabulary : class gastropoda , family buccinoidea , genus cowry , species cypraea madagascariensis , etc .",0
