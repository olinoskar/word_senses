"soon the canadian announced that the craft was a big battleship , a double - decker ironclad complete with ram . dark , dense smoke burst from its two funnels . its furled sails merged with the lines of its yardarms . the gaff of its fore - and - aft sail flew no flag . its distance still kept us from distinguishing the colors of its pennant , which was fluttering like a thin ribbon .",52

"at this the whole pack rose up into the air , and came flying down upon her : she gave a little scream , half of fright and half of anger , and tried to beat them off , and found herself lying on the bank , with her head in the lap of her sister , who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face .",13

"i would have been deeply interested in visiting this long , 360-league reef , against which the ever - surging sea broke with the fearsome intensity of thunderclaps . but just then the nautilus 's slanting fins took us to great depths , and i could see nothing of those high coral walls . i had to rest content with the various specimens of fish brought up by our nets . among others i noted some long - finned albacore , a species in the genus scomber , as big as tuna , bluish on the flanks , and streaked with crosswise stripes that disappear when the animal dies . these fish followed us in schools and supplied our table with very dainty flesh . we also caught a large number of yellow - green gilthead , half a decimeter long and tasting like dorado , plus some flying gurnards , authentic underwater swallows that , on dark nights , alternately streak air and water with their phosphorescent glimmers . among mollusks and zoophytes , i found in our trawl 's meshes various species of alcyonarian coral , sea urchins , hammer shells , spurred - star shells , wentletrap snails , horn shells , glass snails . the local flora was represented by fine floating algae : sea tangle , and kelp from the genus macrocystis , saturated with the mucilage their pores perspire , from which i selected a wonderful nemastoma geliniaroidea , classifying it with the natural curiosities in the museum .",148
"the enormous vessel settled slowly . following it down , the nautilus kept watch on its every movement . suddenly there was an eruption . the air compressed inside the craft sent its decks flying , as if the powder stores had been ignited . the thrust of the waters was so great , the nautilus swerved away .",34
"involuntarily my eyes flew to the window , but i could n't stand the fire devouring it .",3
"at that instant i was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab . instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up , something was screamed to the driver , and the cab flew madly off down regent street . holmes looked eagerly round for another , but no empty one was in sight . then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic , but the start was too great , and already the cab was out of sight .",34

"a sandy beach unfolded before us , measuring 500 feet at its widest point between the waters of the lake and the foot of the mountain 's walls . via this strand you could easily circle the lake . but the base of these high walls consisted of broken soil over which there lay picturesque piles of volcanic blocks and enormous pumice stones . all these crumbling masses were covered with an enamel polished by the action of underground fires , and they glistened under the stream of electric light from our beacon . stirred up by our footsteps , the mica - rich dust on this beach flew into the air like a cloud of sparks .",108
"in less than a quarter of an hour , dorian gray was galloping down the long avenue as hard as he could go . the trees seemed to sweep past him in spectral procession , and wild shadows to fling themselves across his path . once the mare swerved at a white gate - post and nearly threw him . he lashed her across the neck with his crop . she cleft the dusky air like an arrow . the stones flew from her hoofs .",81

"finally , to conclude , conseil classified a large number of flying fish . nothing could have made a more unusual sight than the marvelous timing with which dolphins hunt these fish . whatever the range of its flight , however evasive its trajectory ( even up and over the nautilus ) , the hapless flying fish always found a dolphin to welcome it with open mouth . these were either flying gurnards or kitelike sea robins , whose lips glowed in the dark , at night scrawling fiery streaks in the air before plunging into the murky waters like so many shooting stars .",11

"my eyes flew back to the pressure gauge . the instrument indicated a depth of 6,000 meters . our submergence had been going on for an hour . the nautilus slid downward on its slanting fins , still sinking . these deserted waters were wonderfully clear , with a transparency impossible to convey . an hour later we were at 13,000 meters-- about three and a quarter vertical leagues -- and the ocean floor was nowhere in sight .",2

"its fins set vertically , its propeller thrown in gear at the captain 's signal , the nautilus rose with lightning speed , shooting upward like an air balloon into the sky . vibrating resonantly , it knifed through the watery mass . not a single detail was visible . in four minutes it had cleared the four vertical leagues separating it from the surface of the ocean , and after emerging like a flying fish , it fell back into the sea , making the waves leap to prodigious heights .",74
"some zoophytes were dredged up by the chain of our trawl . most were lovely sea anemone belonging to the family actinidia , including among other species , the phyctalis protexta , native to this part of the ocean : a small cylindrical trunk adorned with vertical lines , mottled with red spots , and crowned by a wondrous blossoming of tentacles . as for mollusks , they consisted of exhibits i had already observed : turret snails , olive shells of the "" tent olive "" species with neatly intersecting lines and russet spots standing out sharply against a flesh - colored background , fanciful spider conchs that looked like petrified scorpions , transparent glass snails , argonauts , some highly edible cuttlefish , and certain species of squid that the naturalists of antiquity classified with the flying fish , which are used chiefly as bait for catching cod .",138
