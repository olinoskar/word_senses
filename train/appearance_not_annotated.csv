"our breakfast - table was cleared early , and holmes waited in his dressing - gown for the promised interview . our clients were punctual to their appointment , for the clock had just struck ten when dr . mortimer was shown up , followed by the young baronet . the latter was a small , alert , dark - eyed man about thirty years of age , very sturdily built , with thick black eyebrows and a strong , pugnacious face . he wore a ruddy - tinted tweed suit and had the weather - beaten appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air , and yet there was something in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated the gentleman .",97

"crossing through the lounge , i arrived at the door , contrived in one of the canted corners , that opened into the captain 's stateroom . much to my astonishment , this door was ajar . i instinctively recoiled . if captain nemo was in his stateroom , he might see me . but , not hearing any sounds , i approached . the stateroom was deserted . i pushed the door open . i took a few steps inside . still the same austere , monastic appearance .",88

"but , as it always happens , just when a decision had been made to chase the monster , the monster put in no further appearances . for two months nobody heard a word about it . not a single ship encountered it . apparently the unicorn had gotten wise to these plots being woven around it . people were constantly babbling about the creature , even via the atlantic cable ! accordingly , the wags claimed that this slippery rascal had waylaid some passing telegram and was making the most of it .",25

"this most curious island has evidently been projected from the bottom of the sea at a comparatively recent date . possibly , it may still be subject to gradual elevation . if this is the case , its origin may well be attributed to subterranean fires . therefore , in this case , the theory of sir humphry davy , saknussemm 's document , and my uncle 's theories would all go off in smoke . this hypothesis led me to examine with more attention the appearance of the surface , and i soon arrived at a conclusion as to the nature of the forces which presided at its birth .",86
"at noon the sun made a momentary appearance . taking advantage of this rift in the clouds , the chief officer took the orb 's altitude . then the sea grew turbulent , we went below again , and the hatch closed once more .",7
"to judge by the distant appearance of the summit of snæfell , it would have seemed too steep to ascend on our side . fortunately , after an hour of fatigue and athletic exercises , in the midst of the vast surface of snow presented by the hollow between the two peaks , a kind of staircase appeared unexpectedly which greatly facilitated our ascent . it was formed by one of those torrents of stones flung up by the eruptions , called ' sting ' by the icelanders . if this torrent had not been arrested in its fall by the formation of the sides of the mountain , it would have gone on to the sea and formed more islands .",5

"the result was that , thanks to these attentions , the stranger resumed a more human appearance , and it even seemed as if his eyes had become milder .",16
"at the same time , aramis made his appearance at the other end of the street upon a superb english charger . bazin followed him upon a roan , holding by the halter a vigorous mecklenburg horse ; this was d’artagnan ’s mount .",8

"ned land was about forty years old . a man of great height -- over six english feet -- he was powerfully built , serious in manner , not very sociable , sometimes headstrong , and quite ill - tempered when crossed . his looks caught the attention , and above all the strength of his gaze , which gave a unique emphasis to his facial appearance .",66
"fix took up a position , and carefully examined each face and figure which made its appearance . presently one of the passengers , after vigorously pushing his way through the importunate crowd of porters , came up to him and politely asked if he could point out the english consulate , at the same time showing a passport which he wished to have visaed . fix instinctively took the passport , and with a rapid glance read the description of its bearer . an involuntary motion of surprise nearly escaped him , for the description in the passport was identical with that of the bank robber which he had received from scotland yard .",16
"in the midst of this moving vegetation , under arbors of water plants , there raced legions of clumsy articulates , in particular some fanged frog crabs whose carapaces form a slightly rounded triangle , robber crabs exclusive to these waterways , and horrible parthenope crabs whose appearance was repulsive to the eye . one animal no less hideous , which i encountered several times , was the enormous crab that mr . darwin observed , to which nature has given the instinct and requisite strength to eat coconuts ; it scrambles up trees on the beach and sends the coconuts tumbling ; they fracture in their fall and are opened by its powerful pincers . here , under these clear waves , this crab raced around with matchless agility , while green turtles from the species frequenting the malabar coast moved sluggishly among the crumbling rocks .",47
