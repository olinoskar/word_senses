"for some reason or other , the house was crowded that night , and the fat jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear to ear with an oily tremulous smile . he escorted them to their box with a sort of pompous humility , waving his fat jewelled hands and talking at the top of his voice . dorian gray loathed him more than ever . he felt as if he had come to look for miranda and had been met by caliban . lord henry , upon the other hand , rather liked him . at least he declared he did , and insisted on shaking him by the hand and assuring him that he was proud to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone bankrupt over a poet .",131

""" because to influence a person is to give him one 's own soul . he does not think his natural thoughts , or burn with his natural passions . his virtues are not real to him . his sins , if there are such things as sins , are borrowed . he becomes an echo of some one else 's music , an actor of a part that has not been written for him . the aim of life is self - development . to realize one 's nature perfectly -- that is what each of us is here for .",34

""" my inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait did not lie , and that this fellow was indeed a baskerville . he was a son of that rodger baskerville , the younger brother of sir charles , who fled with a sinister reputation to south america , where he was said to have died unmarried . he did , as a matter of fact , marry , and had one child , this fellow , whose real name is the same as his father 's . he married beryl garcia , one of the beauties of costa rica , and , having purloined a considerable sum of public money , he changed his name to vandeleur and fled to england , where he established a school in the east of yorkshire . his reason for attempting this special line of business was that he had struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon the voyage home , and that he had used this man 's ability to make the undertaking a success . fraser , the tutor , died however , and the school which had begun well sank from disrepute into infamy . the vandeleurs found it convenient to change their name to stapleton , and he brought the remains of his fortune , his schemes for the future , and his taste for entomology to the south of england . i learned at the british museum that he was a recognized authority upon the subject , and that the name of vandeleur has been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had , in his yorkshire days , been the first to describe .",79

"he shuddered , and for a moment he regretted that he had not told basil the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away . basil would have helped him to resist lord henry 's influence , and the still more poisonous influences that came from his own temperament . the love that he bore him -- for it was really love-- had nothing in it that was not noble and intellectual . it was not that mere physical admiration of beauty that is born of the senses and that dies when the senses tire . it was such love as michelangelo had known , and montaigne , and winckelmann , and shakespeare himself . yes , basil could have saved him . but it was too late now . the past could always be annihilated . regret , denial , or forgetfulness could do that . but the future was inevitable . there were passions in him that would find their terrible outlet , dreams that would make the shadow of their evil real .",177

"his eye fell on the yellow book that lord henry had sent him . what was it , he wondered . he went towards the little , pearl - coloured octagonal stand that had always looked to him like the work of some strange egyptian bees that wrought in silver , and taking up the volume , flung himself into an arm - chair and began to turn over the leaves . after a few minutes he became absorbed . it was the strangest book that he had ever read . it seemed to him that in exquisite raiment , and to the delicate sound of flutes , the sins of the world were passing in dumb show before him . things that he had dimly dreamed of were suddenly made real to him . things of which he had never dreamed were gradually revealed .",131

"the long noses form a peculiar company , under the direct patronage of the god tingou . attired after the fashion of the middle ages , they bore upon their shoulders a splendid pair of wings ; but what especially distinguished them was the long noses which were fastened to their faces , and the uses which they made of them . these noses were made of bamboo , and were five , six , and even ten feet long , some straight , others curved , some ribboned , and some having imitation warts upon them . it was upon these appendages , fixed tightly on their real noses , that they performed their gymnastic exercises . a dozen of these sectaries of tingou lay flat upon their backs , while others , dressed to represent lightning - rods , came and frolicked on their noses , jumping from one to another , and performing the most skilful leapings and somersaults .",108
