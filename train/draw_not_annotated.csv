"then , through the grating to which she had drawn near , milady saw the young man make a sign with delirious fervor , and depart in an apparent transport of joy .",9
"the very cultivation surrounding it had disappeared . i had , by cross - ways and by- paths , once more drawn near the tract of moorland ; and now , only a few fields , almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which they were scarcely reclaimed , lay between me and the dusky hill .",21

"the two guards led the prisoner toward the table , and upon a sign from the commissary drew back so far as to be unable to hear anything .",17

i now drew near and knocked :,2
"in an hour we had reached the islet . two hours later we had completed a full circle around it . it measured four to five miles in circumference . a narrow channel separated it from a considerable shore , perhaps a continent whose limits we could n't see . the existence of this shore seemed to bear out commander maury 's hypotheses . in essence , this ingenious american has noted that between the south pole and the 60th parallel , the sea is covered with floating ice of dimensions much greater than any found in the north atlantic . from this fact he drew the conclusion that the antarctic circle must contain considerable shores , since icebergs ca n't form on the high seas but only along coastlines . according to his calculations , this frozen mass enclosing the southernmost pole forms a vast ice cap whose width must reach 4,000 kilometers .",105
""" then what conclusion may be drawn ? "" asked the reporter .",6
"d’artagnan drew up his request , and m. de treville , on receiving it , assured him that by two o’clock in the morning the four leaves of absence should be at the respective domiciles of the travelers .",1
"as to athos , he went out without any mystery , took his horse , which was tied with those of his friends to the fastenings of the shutters , in four words convinced the attendant of the necessity of a vanguard for their return , carefully examined the priming of his pistols , drew his sword , and took , like a forlorn hope , the road to the camp .",54
"at the moment she entered , the curtain of a small gallery which to that time had been closed , was drawn , and the pale face of the cardinal appeared , he being dressed as a spanish cavalier .",21
""" would you dare to lift your hand to your queen ? "" said anne of austria , drawing herself up to her full height , and fixing her eyes upon the chancellor with an expression almost threatening .",18
"i made some attempts to draw her into conversation , but she seemed a person of few words : a monosyllabic reply usually cut short every effort of that sort .",5
"at three o'clock in the morning , full of uneasiness , i climbed onto the platform . captain nemo had n't left it . he stood in the bow next to his flag , which a mild breeze was unfurling above his head . his eyes never left that vessel . the extraordinary intensity of his gaze seemed to attract it , beguile it , and draw it more surely than if he had it in tow !",66
"he drew his breath short , and strained me so close to him , i could scarcely pant .",1
"the vessel was two miles off . it drew nearer , always moving toward the phosphorescent glow that signaled the nautilus 's presence . i saw its green and red running lights , plus the white lantern hanging from the large stay of its foremast . hazy flickerings were reflected on its rigging and indicated that its furnaces were pushed to the limit . showers of sparks and cinders of flaming coal escaped from its funnels , spangling the air with stars .",8
"cyrus harding and his companions had drawn near the divan , and now arranged the cushions in such a manner as to better support the dying man .",6
"i drew conseil 's attention to the considerable growth of the cerebral lobes found in these intelligent cetaceans . no mammal except man has more abundant cerebral matter . accordingly , seals are quite capable of being educated ; they make good pets , and together with certain other naturalists , i think these animals can be properly trained to perform yeoman service as hunting dogs for fishermen .",1
the baron drew out his watch .,2
"our frigate drew nearer to the cetacean . i examined it with a completely open mind . those reports from the shannon and the helvetia had slightly exaggerated its dimensions , and i put its length at only 250 feet . its girth was more difficult to judge , but all in all , the animal seemed to be wonderfully proportioned in all three dimensions .",2
"all at once he heard his bolts drawn , and made a terrified bound .",7
"the man drew near , and gluing his face to the panel , he stared at us .",2
"often during these excursions , herbert talked with gideon spilett on the incident of the bullet , and the deductions which the engineer drew from it , and one day -- it was the 26th of october -- he said--""but , mr . spilett , do you not think it very extraordinary that , if any castaways have landed on the island , they have not yet shown themselves near granite house ?

"the traveller now , stooping , felt his foot and leg , as if trying whether they were sound ; apparently something ailed them , for he halted to the stile whence i had just risen , and sat down . i was in the mood for being useful , or at least officious , i think , for i now drew near him again .",61
""" the comte de la fere ! "" murmured milady , becoming exceedingly pale , and drawing back till the wall prevented her from going any farther .",16
"i spun around . captain nemo was standing before me , but i almost did n't recognize him . his facial features were transfigured . gleaming with dark fire , his eyes had shrunk beneath his frowning brow . his teeth were half bared . his rigid body , clenched fists , and head drawn between his shoulders , all attested to a fierce hate breathing from every pore . he did n't move . my spyglass fell from his hand and rolled at his feet .",54
yet i drew near and knocked .,2
"from that day forward , who knows where the nautilus took us in the north atlantic basin ? always at incalculable speed ! always amid the high arctic mists ! did it call at the capes of spitzbergen or the shores of novaya zemlya ? did it visit such uncharted seas as the white sea , the kara sea , the gulf of ob , the lyakhov islands , or those unknown beaches on the siberian coast ? i 'm unable to say . i lost track of the passing hours . time was in abeyance on the ship 's clocks . as happens in the polar regions , it seemed that night and day no longer followed their normal sequence . i felt myself being drawn into that strange domain where the overwrought imagination of edgar allan poe was at home . like his fabled arthur gordon pym , i expected any moment to see that "" shrouded human figure , very far larger in its proportions than any dweller among men , "" thrown across the cataract that protects the outskirts of the pole !",126
"one might have said that at this distance she had already entered the vast bay , for a straight line drawn from claw cape to cape mandible would have rested on her starboard quarter .",20
"when the lady of the red cushion came close to porthos , porthos drew his dripping hand from the font .",13

""" now is my time to make peace with this gallant man , "" said d’artagnan to himself , having stood on one side during the whole of the latter part of the conversation ; and with this good feeling drawing near to aramis , who was departing without paying any attention to him , "" monsieur , "" said he , "" you will excuse me , i hope .

"milady asked some questions about the carriage . it was a chaise drawn by three horses , driven by a postillion ; rochefort ’s lackey would precede it , as courier .",12
he imagined himself to be drawn into one of those fantastic intrigues one meets in dreams .,5
"the instruments of transfer were drawn out : st . john , diana , mary , and i , each became possessed of a competency .",5

"the sailor endeavored to speak , but could not get out a word ; so , seizing the pipe , he carried it to his lips , then applying the coal , he drew five or six great whiffs .",33
"nothing was yet to be seen , only they heard the galloping draw nearer .",12
the colonists drew around him .,2
"just then i heard indistinct chords from the organ , melancholy harmonies from some undefinable hymn , actual pleadings from a soul trying to sever its earthly ties . i listened with all my senses at once , barely breathing , immersed like captain nemo in this musical trance that was drawing him beyond the bounds of this world .",51
"the two young men bowed and separated , aramis ascending the street which led to the luxembourg , while d’artagnan , perceiving the appointed hour was approaching , took the road to the carmes - deschaux , saying to himself , "" decidedly i ca n’t draw back ; but at least , if i am killed , i shall be killed by a musketeer .

""" no , "" i heard her say : "" she looks too stupid for any game of the sort . "" ere long a bell tinkled , and the curtain drew up .",31
"there was a moment of silence ; but at length the two englishmen felt ashamed to draw back , and the angrier one descended the five or six steps which led to the cellar , and gave a kick against the door enough to split a wall .",16
"the gentlemen had drawn their swords , but they found themselves taken between two fires . they still hesitated an instant ; but , as before , pride prevailed , and a second kick split the door from bottom to top .",3
"at length she heard the grating of the hinges of the opening gates ; the noise of boots and spurs resounded on the stairs . there was a great murmur of voices which continued to draw near , amid which she seemed to hear her own name pronounced .",35

""" well , in a pinch ca n't my rouquayrol tank supply me with more ? all i have to do is draw it from an ad hoc spigot . besides , professor aronnax , you 'll see for yourself that during these underwater hunting trips , we make no great expenditure of either air or bullets . """,22
"d’artagnan threw down a yet - smoking pistol which he held in his hand , and fell on his knees before his mistress . athos replaced his in his belt ; porthos and aramis , who held their drawn swords in their hands , returned them to their scabbards .",38
"she heeded nothing of what i said ; but when she had tasted the water and drawn breath , she went on thus--",16
"nevertheless , whether the cough had been answered by a similar signal which had fixed the irresolution of the nocturnal seeker , or whether without this aid she saw that she had arrived at the end of her journey , she resolutely drew near to aramis ’s shutter , and tapped , at three equal intervals , with her bent finger .",42
"d’artagnan threw himself on his neck and embraced him tenderly . he then tried to draw him from his moist abode , but to his surprise he perceived that athos staggered .",15
"i mounted into the window- seat : gathering up my feet , i sat cross - legged , like a turk ; and , having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close , i was shrined in double retirement .",25
"nevertheless , i 'm well aware that the nautilus is drawing near to populated shores , and if some chance for salvation becomes available to us , it would be sheer cruelty to sacrifice my companions to my passion for the unknown . i must go with them , perhaps even guide them . but will this opportunity ever arise ? the human being , robbed of his free will , craves such an opportunity ; but the scientist , forever inquisitive , dreads it .",10
"at this movement , which nobody opposed , he resumed a little courage , and ventured to draw up one leg and then the other . at length , with the help of his two hands he lifted himself from the bench , and found himself on his feet .",17
"as additional precaution , pencroft , neb , and ayrton drew it up on a little beach which bordered one of the sides of the grotto , in a spot where it could run no risk of harm .",10
""" it is well i drew the curtain , "" thought i ; and i wished fervently he might not discover my hiding - place : nor would john reed have found it out himself ; he was not quick either of vision or conception ; but eliza just put her head in at the door , and said at once--",5
""" but it must not be forgotten that winter is drawing near , and that in severe frost wood is difficult to work .",10
cyrus harding then busied himself in drawing the plan of the vessel and making the model .,6
""" but he will draw upon his head the punishment reserved for the damned ! "" said felton , with increasing exultation . "" he wills that human vengeance should precede celestial justice . """,4
"but d’artagnan , still keeping on the defensive , drew near to kitty ’s door .",9
"porthos called him drunk , and the stranger drew his sword .",8
"d’artagnan , half stupefied , without his doublet , and with his head bound up in a linen cloth , arose then , and urged by the host , began to descend the stairs ; but on arriving at the kitchen , the first thing he saw was his antagonist talking calmly at the step of a heavy carriage , drawn by two large norman horses .",60
""" that is true , monsieur , "" replied d’artagnan , "" and whether drawn by myself or another , i assure you i shall always view with regret the blood of so brave a gentleman . i will therefore fight in my doublet , like yourself . """,14
it was useless to try to keep pace on foot with a carriage drawn by two powerful horses .,13
""" the picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather too overwhelming contrast .",6
adele and mrs . fairfax drew near to see the pictures .,5
"to this end , i had sat well back on the form , and while seeming to be busy with my sum , had held my slate in such a manner as to conceal my face : i might have escaped notice , had not my treacherous slate somehow happened to slip from my hand , and falling with an obtrusive crash , directly drawn every eye upon me ; i knew it was all over now , and , as i stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate , i rallied my forces for the worst . it came .",64
"ayrton departed at dawn on the 9th , taking the cart drawn by one onager , and two hours after , the electric wire announced that he had found all in order at the corral .",11
"athos , porthos , and aramis instantly drew near one another , while jussac drew up his soldiers .",7
"its strange form caught the eye , and when gideon spilett , on the engineer 's advice , had drawn the outline , they found that it resembled some fantastic animal , a monstrous leviathan , which lay sleeping on the surface of the pacific .",19
"this was in fact the exact shape of the island , which it is of consequence to know , and a tolerably correct map of it was immediately drawn by the reporter .",28
"alas , would i could weep like you ! "" and he drew away his friend , as affectionate as a father , as consoling as a priest , noble as a man who has suffered much .",12
"hence , it resulted when d’artagnan proceeded to draw his sword in earnest , he found himself purely and simply armed with a stump of a sword about eight or ten inches in length , which the host had carefully placed in the scabbard .",8
"i would draw your attention also to an entirely physical cause , which renders the southern colder than the northern hemisphere .",2
why did he utter such strange barks when a sort of uneasiness seemed to draw him towards this well ?,14
"a fifth shot from ayrton laid one low , and the others drew back , not understanding what was going on .",12
"the engineer drew the ladder to the hole , the diameter of which measured nearly six feet , and allowed it to unroll itself after having securely fastened its upper extremity .",2
""" he appears young , and will be easy to educate , and we shall not be obliged to use force to subdue him , nor draw his teeth , as is sometimes done .",26
"now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder , but i would not permit it . then he would draw me to him : no .",23
"what a scene ! we stood dumbstruck , hearts pounding , before this shipwreck caught in the act , as if it had been photographed in its final moments , so to speak ! and already i could see enormous sharks moving in , eyes ablaze , drawn by the lure of human flesh !",47
the conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his succeeding observations .,2
"then cyrus harding , having ended his survey , re - ascended , drew up the ladder , covered the mouth of the well , and returned thoughtfully to the diningroom , saying to himself,-- "" i have seen nothing , and yet there is something there ! """,13
"miss eyre , draw your chair still a little farther forward : you are yet too far back ; i can not see you without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair , which i have no mind to do . """,3
"he then drew two crowns majestically from his purse and gave them to the host , who accompanied him , cap in hand , to the gate , and remounted his yellow horse , which bore him without any further accident to the gate of st . antoine at paris , where his owner sold him for three crowns , which was a very good price , considering that d’artagnan had ridden him hard during the last stage .",2
"and both , with free use of the spur , arrived at st . omer without drawing bit .",16
"when the nautilus returned to the surface of the ocean , i could take in reao island over its whole flat , wooded expanse . obviously its madreporic rocks had been made fertile by tornadoes and thunderstorms . one day , carried off by a hurricane from neighboring shores , some seed fell onto these limestone beds , mixing with decomposed particles of fish and marine plants to form vegetable humus . propelled by the waves , a coconut arrived on this new coast . its germ took root . its tree grew tall , catching steam off the water . a brook was born . little by little , vegetation spread . tiny animals -- worms , insects -- rode ashore on tree trunks snatched from islands to windward . turtles came to lay their eggs . birds nested in the young trees . in this way animal life developed , and drawn by the greenery and fertile soil , man appeared . and that 's how these islands were formed , the immense achievement of microscopic animals .",153
"this did not take long . at the end of five minutes they perceived the carriage drawn up by the roadside ; a cavalier , richly dressed , was close to the door .",16
"the road between prospect heights and the sources of the stream was already partly beaten , and with a better cart than the first , the material could be easily conveyed to the spot , especially if they could manage to capture some animals to draw it .",45

"they entered the roadstead ; but as they drew near in order to cast anchor , a little cutter , looking like a coastguard formidably armed , approached the merchant vessel and dropped into the sea a boat which directed its course to the ladder .",8
"the next day , at dawn , cyrus harding and ayrton , mounting the cart drawn by two onagers , took the road to the corral and set off at a round trot .",15

"aramis , who was constantly at work at his poem , shut himself up in athos ’s closet , and begged not to be disturbed before the moment of drawing swords .",29
he was already taught to make himself useful by drawing loads of wood and carting away the stones which were extracted from the bed of creek glycerine .,9
"this being properly done , they drew the comte de wardes close to his servant ; and as night was approaching , and as the wounded man and the bound man were at some little distance within the wood , it was evident they were likely to remain there till the next day .",6

he was gently drawn up to granite house .,3
"then as the steps drew near , she became silent for fear of being heard , applying , with a gesture of infinite terror , her beautiful hand to felton ’s mouth .",4
"the host gave them another chamber , and served them with fresh eggs and some water , which athos went himself to draw at the fountain .",22
"its fishing finished , the nautilus drew nearer to the coast . in this locality a number of sea turtles were sleeping on the surface of the waves . it would have been difficult to capture these valuable reptiles , because they wake up at the slightest sound , and their solid carapaces are harpoon - proof . but our suckerfish would effect their capture with extraordinary certainty and precision . in truth , this animal is a living fishhook , promising wealth and happiness to the greenest fisherman in the business .",6
