"all sad feelings seemed now driven from the house , all gloomy associations forgotten : there was life everywhere , movement all day long . you could not now traverse the gallery , once so hushed , nor enter the front chambers , once so tenantless , without encountering a smart lady's - maid or a dandy valet .",41
"the baron , attracted by the noise , in his chamber gown , his sword under his arm , stood in the doorway .",10
"he sat all night on his stool , starting at the least noise ; and when the first rays of the sun penetrated into his chamber , the dawn itself appeared to him to have taken funereal tints .",25
""" be at ease , felton , "" said lord de winter . "" she is not dead ; demons do not die so easily . be tranquil , and go wait for me in my chamber . """,36
""" what business had you , then , to go into the chamber of monsieur d’artagnan , your neighbor , with whom you had a long conference during the day ? """,12
"considerable works are necessary -- a special set of tools , an apparatus of platina , leaden chambers , unassailable by the acid , and in which the transformation is performed , etc . the engineer had none of these at his disposal , but he knew that , in bohemia especially , sulphuric acid is manufactured by very simple means , which have also the advantage of producing it to a superior degree of concentration .",17
"the next morning , when d’artagnan entered aramis ’s chamber , he found him at the window .",9
""" now , retire to your chambers , "" said athos , "" and leave me to act . you must perceive that in my quality of a husband this concerns me .",6
"in the meantime , the host , who entertained no doubt that it was the presence of the young man that drove the stranger from his hostelry , re - ascended to his wife ’s chamber , and found d’artagnan just recovering his senses .",35
"i lingered ; the moon shut herself wholly within her chamber , and drew close her curtain of dense cloud : the night grew dark ; rain came driving fast on the gale .",10
i walked about the chamber most of the time .,4
"the son , who had been his father 's secretary , had resigned along with his chief , somewhat foolishly as was thought at the time , and on succeeding some months later to the title , had set himself to the serious study of the great aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing . he had two large town houses , but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble , and took most of his meals at his club . he paid some attention to the management of his collieries in the midland counties , excusing himself for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of burning wood on his own hearth .",66
"feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellised panes , and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around ; the eye , however , struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber , or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling .",40
"my eye was quickly at the aperture . celine 's chamber - maid entered , lit a lamp , left it on the table , and withdrew .",10
"there were moments , indeed , at night , when , lying sleepless in his own delicately scented chamber , or in the sordid room of the little ill - famed tavern near the docks which , under an assumed name and in disguise , it was his habit to frequent , he would think of the ruin he had brought upon his soul with a pity that was all the more poignant because it was purely selfish . but moments such as these were rare . that curiosity about life which lord henry had first stirred in him , as they sat together in the garden of their friend , seemed to increase with gratification . the more he knew , the more he desired to know . he had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them .",18
"it was not till after i had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night , that i steadily reviewed the tale mr . rochester had told me .",11
"just then it seemed my chamber - door was touched ; as if fingers had swept the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside . i said , "" who is there ? "" nothing answered .",5
"i was chilled with fear . all at once i remembered that it might be pilot , who , when the kitchen- door chanced to be left open , not unfrequently found his way up to the threshold of mr . rochester 's chamber : i had seen him lying there myself in the mornings .",43
"at the top of the stairs , upon the most conspicuous door of the corridor , was traced in black ink a gigantic number "" 1 . "" d’artagnan knocked , and upon the bidding to come in which came from inside , he entered the chamber .",46
"this was a demoniac laugh -- low , suppressed , and deep -- uttered , as it seemed , at the very keyhole of my chamber door .",25
"i thought no more of mrs . fairfax ; i thought no more of grace poole , or the laugh : in an instant , i was within the chamber .",29
""" go out this way , "" said she , opening a small private door , "" and come back at eleven o’clock ; we will then terminate this conversation . kitty will conduct you to my chamber . """,37
"a very chill and vault - like air pervaded the stairs and gallery , suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude ; and i was glad , when finally ushered into my chamber , to find it of small dimensions , and furnished in ordinary , modern style .",32
"d’artagnan left the hotel instead of going up at once to kitty ’s chamber , as she endeavored to persuade him to do -- and that for two reasons : the first , because by this means he should escape reproaches , recriminations , and prayers ; the second , because he was not sorry to have an opportunity of reading his own thoughts and endeavoring , if possible , to fathom those of this woman .",13
but the real adieux were made in mme . coquenard ’s chamber ; they were heartrending .,11
"kitty , who was to set out that evening for tours , was waiting in the next chamber .",17
"he found kitty at the gate , and , as on the preceding evening , went up to her chamber .",19
"and overhead -- yes , in the room just above my chamber - ceiling -- i now heard a struggle : a deadly one it seemed from the noise ; and a half - smothered voice shouted--",11
"he roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried , unequal , and objectless step .",3
"he roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried , unequal , and objectless step .",5
"the fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface from our minds the grim and gray impression which had been left upon both of us by our first experience of baskerville hall . as sir henry and i sat at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through the high mullioned windows , throwing watery patches of colour from the coats of arms which covered them . the dark panelling glowed like bronze in the golden rays , and it was hard to realize that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such a gloom into our souls upon the evening before .",89
""" here , jane ! "" he said ; and i walked round to the other side of a large bed , which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of the chamber .",33
diana and mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day . they would whisper sentences of this sort at my bedside--,6
"i mounted to my chamber ; locked myself in ; fell on my knees ; and prayed in my way -- a different way to st . john 's , but effective in its own fashion . i seemed to penetrate very near a mighty spirit ; and my soul rushed out in gratitude at his feet .",4
"god doubtless neither heard nor saw me , and i sank upon the floor a prey to a slumber which resembled death . "" of all that passed in that sleep , or the time which glided away while it lasted , i have no remembrance . the only thing i recollect is that i awoke in bed in a round chamber , the furniture of which was sumptuous , and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the ceiling . no door gave entrance to the room . it might be called a magnificent prison .",61
"the chamber was evidently furnished for the reception of a woman ; and the most finished coquette could not have formed a wish , but on casting her eyes about the apartment , she would have found that wish accomplished .",1
""" well , well ! "" and d’artagnan rushed into athos ’s chamber .",12
"in an instant , thanks to the lamp , my chamber was once more lighted . "" i was determined to eat only such things as could not possibly have anything soporific introduced into them .",10
"thursday came : all work had been completed the previous evening ; carpets were laid down , bed - hangings festooned , radiant white counterpanes spread , toilet tables arranged , furniture rubbed , flowers piled in vases : both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make them .",40
"one of the nautilus 's men presented me with a streamlined rifle whose butt was boilerplate steel , hollow inside , and of fairly large dimensions . this served as a tank for the compressed air , which a trigger - operated valve could release into the metal chamber . in a groove where the butt was heaviest , a cartridge clip held some twenty electric bullets that , by means of a spring , automatically took their places in the barrel of the rifle . as soon as one shot had been fired , another was ready to go off .",48
"the stillness of early morning slumbered everywhere ; the curtains were yet drawn over the servants ' chamber windows ; little birds were just twittering in the blossom - blanched orchard trees , whose boughs drooped like white garlands over the wall enclosing one side of the yard ; the carriage horses stamped from time to time in their closed stables : all else was still .",17
"all this doubt only gave rise to a more lively desire of arriving at a certainty , and he went into his friend ’s chamber with a fixed determination of renewing the conversation of the preceding evening ; but he found athos quite himself again -- that is to say , the most shrewd and impenetrable of men .",24
"d’artagnan drew back the bolt with precaution , and both , light as shadows , glided through the interior door into the passage , ascended the stairs as quietly as possible , and entered d’artagnan ’s chambers .",36
what cold fingers ! they were warmer last night when i touched them at the door of the mysterious chamber .,19
it was necessary that d’artagnan should find alone the staircase and the little chamber .,13
