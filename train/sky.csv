""" how horribly unjust of you ! "" cried lord henry , tilting his hat back and looking up at the little clouds that , like ravelled skeins of glossy white silk , were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the summer sky .",42,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"by nine o'clock we had pulled up to shore . the sky was growing brighter . clouds were fleeing to the south . mists were rising from the cold surface of the water . captain nemo headed toward the peak , which he no doubt planned to make his observatory . it was an arduous climb over sharp lava and pumice stones in the midst of air often reeking with sulfurous fumes from the smoke holes . for a man out of practice at treading land , the captain scaled the steepest slopes with a supple agility i could n't equal , and which would have been envied by hunters of pyrenees mountain goats .",11,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"it took us two hours to reach the summit of this half - crystal , half - basalt peak . from there our eyes scanned a vast sea , which scrawled its boundary line firmly against the background of the northern sky . at our feet : dazzling tracts of white . over our heads : a pale azure , clear of mists . north of us : the sun 's disk , like a ball of fire already cut into by the edge of the horizon . from the heart of the waters : jets of liquid rising like hundreds of magnificent bouquets . far off , like a sleeping cetacean : the nautilus . behind us to the south and east : an immense shore , a chaotic heap of rocks and ice whose limits we could n't see .",41,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"as the dawn was just breaking , he found himself close to covent garden . the darkness lifted , and , flushed with faint fires , the sky hollowed itself into a perfect pearl . huge carts filled with nodding lilies rumbled slowly down the polished empty street . the air was heavy with the perfume of the flowers , and their beauty seemed to bring him an anodyne for his pain . he followed into the market and watched the men unloading their waggons . a white - smocked carter offered him some cherries . he thanked him , wondered why he refused to accept any money for them , and began to eat them listlessly . they had been plucked at midnight , and the coldness of the moon had entered into them .",27,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"april advanced to may : a bright serene may it was ; days of blue sky , placid sunshine , and soft western or southern gales filled up its duration .",15,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"the moon then passed its zenith . jupiter was rising in the east . in the midst of this placid natural setting , sky and ocean competed with each other in tranquility , and the sea offered the orb of night the loveliest mirror ever to reflect its image .",23,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"alice laughed so much at this , that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her ; and when she next peeped out the fish - footman was gone , and the other was sitting on the ground near the door , staring stupidly up into the sky .",53,"('sky', 'air', 'cielo')",1
"' there might be some sense in your knocking , ' the footman went on without attending to her , ' if we had the door between us . for instance , if you were inside , you might knock , and i could let you out , you know . ' he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking , and this alice thought decidedly uncivil . ' but perhaps he ca n't help it , ' she said to herself ; ' his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head . but at any rate he might answer questions.--how am i to get in ? ' she repeated , aloud .",58,"('sky', 'air', 'cielo')",1
"my mind was made up . the canadian left me . i went out on the platform , where i could barely stand upright against the jolts of the billows . the skies were threatening , but land lay inside those dense mists , and we had to escape . not a single day , or even a single hour , could we afford to lose .",32,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"snæfell is 5,000 feet high . its double cone forms the limit of a trachytic belt which stands out distinctly in the mountain system of the island . from our starting point we could see the two peaks boldly projected against the dark grey sky ; i could see an enormous cap of snow coming low down upon the giant 's brow .",44,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"and the four friends , seconded by grimaud , pushed with the barrels of their muskets an enormous sheet of the wall , which bent as if pushed by the wind , and detaching itself from its base , fell with a horrible crash into the ditch . then a fearful crash was heard ; a cloud of dust mounted toward the sky -- and all was over !",62,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"five days after , the kiln was supplied with coal , which the engineer had discovered lying open to the sky towards the mouth of the red creek , and the first smoke escaped from a chimney twenty feet high .",20,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"passepartout 's visage darkened with the skies , and for two days the poor fellow experienced constant fright . but phileas fogg was a bold mariner , and knew how to maintain headway against the sea ; and he kept on his course , without even decreasing his steam . the henrietta , when she could not rise upon the waves , crossed them , swamping her deck , but passing safely . sometimes the screw rose out of the water , beating its protruding end , when a mountain of water raised the stern above the waves ; but the craft always kept straight ahead .",6,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"we know that god is everywhere ; but certainly we feel his presence most when his works are on the grandest scale spread before us ; and it is in the unclouded night - sky , where his worlds wheel their silent course , that we read clearest his infinitude , his omnipotence , his omnipresence .",34,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"at mid - day we arrived . i raised my head and saw straight above me the upper aperture of the cone , framing a bit of sky of very small circumference , but almost perfectly round . just upon the edge appeared the snowy peak of saris , standing out sharp and clear against endless space .",27,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
i led him out of the wet and wild wood into some cheerful fields : i described to him how brilliantly green they were ; how the flowers and hedges looked refreshed ; how sparklingly blue was the sky .,38,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"cyrus harding and pencroft went to the room occupied by the stranger , who was found lying near the window and gazing at the sky .",24,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"just at sunset , the air turned cold and the sky cloudy : i went in , sophie called me upstairs to look at my wedding - dress , which they had just brought ; and under it in the box i found your present -- the veil which , in your princely extravagance , you sent for from london : resolved , i suppose , since i would not have jewels , to cheat me into accepting something as costly .",10,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0

""" i like this day ; i like that sky of steel ; i like the sternness and stillness of the world under this frost . i like thornfield , its antiquity , its retirement , its old crow - trees and thorn - trees , its grey facade , and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin : and yet how long have i abhorred the very thought of it , shunned it like a great plague - house ? how i do still abhor-- """,9,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
""" yes , there is the sky ; here is the sea !",6,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"by then we were forced to go back down to the beach because the ridge had become impossible . above us , the yawning crater looked like the wide mouth of a well . from where we stood , the sky was pretty easy to see , and i watched clouds race by , disheveled by the west wind , letting tatters of mist trail over the mountain 's summit . proof positive that those clouds kept at a moderate altitude , because this volcano did n't rise more than 1,800 feet above the level of the ocean .",40,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"the whole sky was of a threatening aspect , and the first symptoms of a violent storm were clearly visible .",2,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"the sea was magnificent , the skies clear . this long aquatic vehicle could barely feel the broad undulations of the ocean . a mild breeze out of the east rippled the surface of the water . free of all mist , the horizon was ideal for taking sights .",6,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0

"while he was arguing in this manner , the sky was overcast , the winds blew from the four quarters of the compass , and the ship was assailed by a most terrible tempest , within sight of the port of lisbon .",9,"('sky', 'air', 'cielo')",1
"the tempest ended about the 9th of march , but the sky remained covered with clouds during the whole of this last summer month .",11,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"the storm had ceased during the night . the last low mutterings of the thunder died away in the west . rain fell no longer , but the sky was yet obscured by clouds .",28,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"there he was , sure enough , a small urchin with a little bundle upon his shoulder , toiling slowly up the hill . when he reached the crest i saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant against the cold blue sky . he looked round him with a furtive and stealthy air , as one who dreads pursuit . then he vanished over the hill .",43,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"in fact , the settlers longed to exchange the insufficient shelter of the chimneys for this large and healthy retreat , in the midst of solid rock , and sheltered from the water both of the sea and sky .",38,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0

"towards five o'clock in the morning of the 25th of march , the sky began to lighten ; the horizon still remained dark , but with daybreak a thick mist rose from the sea , so that the eye could scarcely penetrate beyond twenty feet or so from where they stood .",13,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0

"towards the west , a cloudy belt , clearly visible at the horizon , increased the gloom , and the eye could not discover if the sky and water were blended together in the same circular line .",26,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"in front of them the lys rolled its waters like a river of molten tin ; while on the other side was a black mass of trees , profiled on a stormy sky , invaded by large coppery clouds which created a sort of twilight amid the night .",32,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"but once or twice , large shadows , veiling the sun , which described its diurnal arc through an extremely clear sky , indicated that a thick cloud of smoke passed between its disc and the island .",21,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0

"while lord henry sat dreaming on these things , a knock came to the door , and his valet entered and reminded him it was time to dress for dinner . he got up and looked out into the street . the sunset had smitten into scarlet gold the upper windows of the houses opposite . the panes glowed like plates of heated metal . the sky above was like a faded rose . he thought of his friend 's young fiery - coloured life and wondered how it was all going to end .",66,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"at any rate , some leagues to the windward there must be some noisy phenomenon , for now the roarings are heard with increasing loudness . do they proceed from the sky or the ocean ?",31,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"my companions and i then witnessed an unusual sight . the panels in the lounge were open , and since the nautilus 's beacon was off , a hazy darkness reigned in the midst of the waters . covered with heavy clouds , the stormy sky gave only the faintest light to the ocean 's upper strata .",45,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0

"but the skies became more and more threatening . there were conspicuous signs of a hurricane on the way . the atmosphere was turning white and milky . slender sheaves of cirrus clouds were followed on the horizon by layers of nimbocumulus . other low clouds fled swiftly . the sea grew towering , inflated by long swells . every bird had disappeared except a few petrels , friends of the storms . the barometer fell significantly , indicating a tremendous tension in the surrounding haze . the mixture in our stormglass decomposed under the influence of the electricity charging the air . a struggle of the elements was approaching .",2,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"that sky with its high and light clouds which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm -- this placid and balmly atmosphere ? """,1,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"at ten o'clock in the evening , the skies caught on fire . the air was streaked with violent flashes of lightning . i could n't stand this brightness , but captain nemo stared straight at it , as if to inhale the spirit of the storm . a dreadful noise filled the air , a complicated noise made up of the roar of crashing breakers , the howl of the wind , claps of thunder . the wind shifted to every point of the horizon , and the cyclone left the east to return there after passing through north , west , and south , moving in the opposite direction of revolving storms in the southern hemisphere .",8,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
""" but will the sun show through this mist ? "" i said , staring at the grayish sky .",18,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"the next day , june 1 , the nautilus kept to the same tack . it was obviously trying to locate some precise spot in the ocean . just as on the day before , captain nemo came to take the altitude of the sun . the sea was smooth , the skies clear . eight miles to the east , a big steamship was visible on the horizon line . no flag was flapping from the gaff of its fore - and - aft sail , and i could n't tell its nationality .",52,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
"when i rejoined captain nemo , i found him leaning silently against a piece of rock and staring at the sky . he seemed impatient , baffled . but what could we do ? this daring and powerful man could n't control the sun as he did the sea .",20,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0

"i stood amazed . my uncle had uplifted his long arms to the vault which was our sky ; his mouth gaping wide , his eyes flashing behind his shining spectacles , his head balancing with an up - and - down motion , his whole attitude denoted unlimited astonishment . here he stood facing an immense collection of scattered leptotheria , mericotheria , lophiodia , anoplotheria , megatheria , mastodons , protopithecæ , pterodactyles , and all sorts of extinct monsters here assembled together for his special satisfaction . fancy an enthusiastic bibliomaniac suddenly brought into the midst of the famous alexandrian library burnt by omar and restored by a miracle from its ashes ! just such a crazed enthusiast was my uncle , professor liedenbrock .",17,"('sky', 'ciel', 'cielo')",0
