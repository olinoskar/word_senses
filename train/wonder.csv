"there , in place of natural wonders , the watery mass offered some thrilling and dreadful scenes to my eyes . in essence , we were then crossing that part of the whole mediterranean so fertile in casualties . from the coast of algiers to the beaches of provence , how many ships have wrecked , how many vessels have vanished ! compared to the vast liquid plains of the pacific , the mediterranean is a mere lake , but it 's an unpredictable lake with fickle waves , today kindly and affectionate to those frail single - masters drifting between a double ultramarine of sky and water , tomorrow bad - tempered and turbulent , agitated by the winds , demolishing the strongest ships beneath sudden waves that smash down with a headlong wallop .",6,"('wonder', 'merveille', 'maravillar')",0
"as for captain nemo , i wondered what he would make of our escaping , what concern or perhaps what distress it might cause him , and what he would do in the twofold event of our attempt either failing or being found out ! certainly i had no complaints to register with him , on the contrary . never was hospitality more wholehearted than his . yet in leaving him i could n't be accused of ingratitude . no solemn promises bound us to him . in order to keep us captive , he had counted only on the force of circumstances and not on our word of honor . but his avowed intention to imprison us forever on his ship justified our every effort .",6,"('wonder', 'demander', 'preguntar')",1
"then he rose from the table , lit a cigarette , and flung himself down on a luxuriously cushioned couch that stood facing the screen . the screen was an old one , of gilt spanish leather , stamped and wrought with a rather florid louis - quatorze pattern . he scanned it curiously , wondering if ever before it had concealed the secret of a man 's life .",55,"('wonder', 'demander', 'preguntándose')",2
""" ye gods , "" conseil replied , "" i hardly know what to tell master . we 're certainly seeing some unusual things , and for two months we 've had no time for boredom . the latest wonder is always the most astonishing , and if this progression keeps up , i ca n't imagine what its climax will be . in my opinion , we 'll never again have such an opportunity .

"as he often remembered afterwards , and always with no small wonder , he found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost scientific interest . that such a change should have taken place was incredible to him . and yet it was a fact . was there some subtle affinity between the chemical atoms that shaped themselves into form and colour on the canvas and the soul that was within him ? could it be that what that soul thought , they realized?--that what it dreamed , they made true ? or was there some other , more terrible reason ? he shuddered , and felt afraid , and , going back to the couch , lay there , gazing at the picture in sickened horror .",11,"('wonder', 'étonnement', 'asombrar')",3

"i took one last look at the natural wonders and artistic treasures amassed in the museum , this unrivaled collection doomed to perish someday in the depths of the seas , together with its curator . i wanted to establish one supreme impression in my mind . i stayed there an hour , basking in the aura of the ceiling lights , passing in review the treasures shining in their glass cases . then i returned to my stateroom . there i dressed in sturdy seafaring clothes . i gathered my notes and packed them tenderly about my person . my heart was pounding mightily . i could n't curb its pulsations . my anxiety and agitation would certainly have given me away if captain nemo had seen me .",8,"('wonder', 'merveille', 'maravillar')",0

"will anyone believe me ? i do n't know . ultimately it 's unimportant . what i can now assert is that i 've earned the right to speak of these seas , beneath which in less than ten months , i 've cleared 20,000 leagues in this underwater tour of the world that has shown me so many wonders across the pacific , the indian ocean , the red sea , the mediterranean , the atlantic , the southernmost and northernmost seas !",59,"('wonder', 'merveille', 'maravillar')",0
"dorian gray drew a long breath . the colour came back to his cheeks , and a smile played about his lips . the peril was over . he was safe for the time . yet he could not help feeling infinite pity for the painter who had just made this strange confession to him , and wondered if he himself would ever be so dominated by the personality of a friend . lord henry had the charm of being very dangerous . but that was all . he was too clever and too cynical to be really fond of . would there ever be some one who would fill him with a strange idolatry ? was that one of the things that life had in store ?",57,"('wonder', 'demander', 'preguntar')",1
"i gazed upon these wonders in silence . words failed me to express my feelings . i felt as if i was in some distant planet uranus or neptune -- and in the presence of phenomena of which my terrestrial experience gave me no cognisance . for such novel sensations , new words were wanted ; and my imagination failed to supply them . i gazed , i thought , i admired , with a stupefaction mingled with a certain amount of fear .",4,"('wonder', 'merveille', 'maravillar')",0

"but just when i least expected it , i laid my hands on a wonder , a natural deformity i 'd have to call it , something very seldom encountered . conseil had just made a cast of the dragnet , and his gear had come back up loaded with a variety of fairly ordinary seashells , when suddenly he saw me plunge my arms swiftly into the net , pull out a shelled animal , and give a conchological yell , in other words , the most piercing yell a human throat can produce .",14,"('wonder', 'merveille', 'maravillar')",0

"this measure was distasteful to me . to my mind it would lead nowhere . we could hope for nothing from the nautilus 's commander but could depend only on ourselves . besides , for some time now the man had been gloomier , more withdrawn , less sociable . he seemed to be avoiding me . i encountered him only at rare intervals . he used to take pleasure in explaining the underwater wonders to me ; now he left me to my research and no longer entered the lounge .",74,"('wonder', 'merveille', 'maravillar')",0
