"phileas fogg , by this resolution , inevitably sacrificed himself ; he pronounced his own doom . the delay of a single day would make him lose the steamer at new york , and his bet would be certainly lost . but as he thought , "" it is my duty , "" he did not hesitate .",18
"phileas fogg gazed at the tempestuous sea , which seemed to be struggling especially to delay him , with his habitual tranquillity . he never changed countenance for an instant , though a delay of twenty hours , by making him too late for the yokohama boat , would almost inevitably cause the loss of the wager . but this man of nerve manifested neither impatience nor annoyance ; it seemed as if the storm were a part of his programme , and had been foreseen . aouda was amazed to find him as calm as he had been from the first time she saw him .",15
"fix did not look at the state of things in the same light . the storm greatly pleased him . his satisfaction would have been complete had the rangoon been forced to retreat before the violence of wind and waves . each delay filled him with hope , for it became more and more probable that fogg would be obliged to remain some days at hong kong ; and now the heavens themselves became his allies , with the gusts and squalls . it mattered not that they made him sea - sick -- he made no account of this inconvenience ; and , whilst his body was writhing under their effects , his spirit bounded with hopeful exultation .",42
""" what is the employment you had in view , mr . rivers ? i hope this delay will not have increased the difficulty of securing it . """,17

"her coming was my hope each day , her parting was my pain ; the chance that did her steps delay was ice in every vein .",20
"we had to cross a few narrow fiords , and at last quite a wide gulf ; the tide , then high , allowed us to pass over without delay , and to reach the hamlet of alftanes , one mile beyond .",29
"this news caused intense excitement . not even a 24-hour breather was granted to commander farragut . his provisions were loaded on board . his coal bunkers were overflowing . not a crewman was missing from his post . to cast off , he needed only to fire and stoke his furnaces ! half a day 's delay would have been unforgivable ! but commander farragut wanted nothing more than to go forth .",57
"my uncle put his ruhmkorff 's apparatus in action ; the raft moored to the shore was left alone ; the mouth of the tunnel was not twenty yards from us ; and our party , with myself at the head , made for it without a moment 's delay .",49

"cyrus harding wished to set out without delay ; but as the expedition would be of some days duration , it appeared best to load the cart with different materials and tools in order to facilitate the organization of the encampments .",7
"by evening , the log showed that two hundred and twenty miles had been accomplished from hong kong , and mr . fogg might hope that he would be able to reach yokohama without recording any delay in his journal ; in which case , the many misadventures which had overtaken him since he left london would not seriously affect his journey .",36
""" yes , sir . we 're shut up in a relatively confined area . if the nautilus 's pumps continually injected streams of boiling water into this space , would n't that raise its temperature and delay its freezing ? """,37
"it was necessary to make the journey in five hours and a half ; and this would have been easy on a clear road throughout . but there were forced delays , and when mr . fogg stepped from the train at the terminus , all the clocks in london were striking ten minutes before nine .",30
"at noon the next day , november 5 , the agreed - upon delay expired . after a position fix , true to his promise , commander farragut would have to set his course for the southeast and leave the northerly regions of the pacific decisively behind .",13

""" quite so . well , sir henry , i am of one mind with you as to the advisability of your going down to devonshire without delay . there is only one provision which i must make . you certainly must not go alone . """,27
""" i know it , mr . fogg , "" replied aouda ; "" and i ask you in my turn , will you forgive me for having followed you , and -- who knows?--for having , perhaps , delayed you , and thus contributed to your ruin ? """,39
"the lamplight struggled out through the fog , and hallward looked at his watch . "" i have heaps of time , "" he answered . "" the train does n't go till twelve - fifteen , and it is only just eleven . in fact , i was on my way to the club to look for you , when i met you . you see , i sha n't have any delay about luggage , as i have sent on my heavy things . all i have with me is in this bag , and i can easily get to victoria in twenty minutes .

"the san francisco steamer was announced to leave that very evening , and it became necessary to find passepartout , if possible , without delay . mr . fogg applied in vain to the french and english consuls , and , after wandering through the streets a long time , began to despair of finding his missing servant . chance , or perhaps a kind of presentiment , at last led him into the honourable mr . batulcar 's theatre . he certainly would not have recognised passepartout in the eccentric mountebank 's costume ; but the latter , lying on his back , perceived his master in the gallery . he could not help starting , which so changed the position of his nose as to bring the "" pyramid "" pell - mell upon the stage .",24
"passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie . up to his arrival at bombay , he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there ; but , now that they were plainly whirling across india at full speed , a sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams . his old vagabond nature returned to him ; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took possession of him . he came to regard his master 's project as intended in good earnest , believed in the reality of the bet , and therefore in the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail within the designated period . already he began to worry about possible delays , and accidents which might happen on the way . he recognised himself as being personally interested in the wager , and trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable folly of the night before . being much less cool - headed than mr . fogg , he was much more restless , counting and recounting the days passed over , uttering maledictions when the train stopped , and accusing it of sluggishness , and mentally blaming mr . fogg for not having bribed the engineer . the worthy fellow was ignorant that , while it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer , it could not be done on the railway .",123
"cyrus harding , therefore , resolved to proceed without any further delay to the fabrication of a strong rope ladder , which , once raised , would render granite house completely inaccessible .",11
""" take him , brother stangerson , "" he said , "" give him food and drink , and the child likewise . let it be your task also to teach him our holy creed . we have delayed long enough . forward ! on , on to zion ! """,38
""" we must become one flesh without any delay , jane : there is but the licence to get -- then we marry . """,8
"after two hours the guide stopped the elephant , and gave him an hour for rest , during which kiouni , after quenching his thirst at a neighbouring spring , set to devouring the branches and shrubs round about him . neither sir francis nor mr . fogg regretted the delay , and both descended with a feeling of relief . "" why , he 's made of iron ! "" exclaimed the general , gazing admiringly on kiouni .",50
"at any rate , the most important thing was that the two wounds should be dressed without delay .",17

pencroft and the engineer talked of the different projects which it was agreed to put into execution with the briefest possible delay .,21
"the daily - renewed promise of the young man that the moment would not long be delayed , had alone kept him in the service of a musketeer -- a service in which , he said , his soul was in constant jeopardy .",16
she had already been an hour in this apartment ; they could not long delay bringing her a repast .,14
"they set noiselessly to work , and the parsee on one side and passepartout on the other began to loosen the bricks so as to make an aperture two feet wide . they were getting on rapidly , when suddenly a cry was heard in the interior of the temple , followed almost instantly by other cries replying from the outside . passepartout and the guide stopped . had they been heard ? was the alarm being given ? common prudence urged them to retire , and they did so , followed by phileas fogg and sir francis . they again hid themselves in the wood , and waited till the disturbance , whatever it might be , ceased , holding themselves ready to resume their attempt without delay . but , awkwardly enough , the guards now appeared at the rear of the temple , and there installed themselves , in readiness to prevent a surprise .",128
""" you are right , madam , "" replied fix ; "" a meeting between them might ruin all . whether he were victorious or beaten , mr . fogg would be delayed , and-- """,32
""" but are you not subject to considerable delays ? """,8
"after a comfortable breakfast , served in the car , mr . fogg and his partners had just resumed whist , when a violent whistling was heard , and the train stopped . passepartout put his head out of the door , but saw nothing to cause the delay ; no station was in view .",48
"of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax : gratified it must be , and that without delay ; and i told him so .",19
""" you see , then , "" said d’artagnan , "" that i must have that letter . so no more delay , no more hesitation ; or else whatever may be my repugnance to soiling my sword a second time with the blood of a wretch like you , i swear by my faith as an honest man-- "" and at these words d’artagnan made so fierce a gesture that the wounded man sprang up .",21

""" in that case , my brave lieutenant , let us leave milady to find out something else , and go to supper ; but be easy ! she has a fruitful imagination , and the second act of the comedy will not delay its steps after the first . """,43
"indeed , despite its efforts , despite the powerful methods it used to split this ice , the nautilus was reduced to immobility . ordinarily , when someone ca n't go any farther , he still has the option of returning in his tracks . but here it was just as impossible to turn back as to go forward , because every passageway had closed behind us , and if our submersible remained even slightly stationary , it would be frozen in without delay . which is exactly what happened near two o'clock in the afternoon , and fresh ice kept forming over the ship 's sides with astonishing speed . i had to admit that captain nemo 's leadership had been most injudicious .",83
"however , gideon spilett wished without further delay to reconnoiter the approaches to the corral , and pencroft , who was quite out of patience , volunteered to accompany him .",7
"helen sighed as her reverie fled , and getting up , obeyed the monitor without reply as without delay .",18
"upon the whole , as i found by all his discourse a settled affection to me , and that nothing could part him from me , so i found all the foundation of his desire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent affection to the people , and his hopes of my doing them good ; a thing which , as i had no notion of myself , so i had not the least thought or intention , or desire of undertaking it . but still i found a strong inclination to attempting my escape , founded on the supposition gathered from the discourse , that there were seventeen bearded men there ; and therefore , without any more delay , i went to work with friday to find out a great tree proper to fell , and make a large periagua , or canoe , to undertake the voyage . there were trees enough in the island to have built a little fleet , not of periaguas or canoes , but even of good , large vessels ; but the main thing i looked at was , to get one so near the water that we might launch it when it was made , to avoid the mistake i committed at first .",123
"this incident did not interrupt our walk . for two hours we were sometimes led over plains of sand , sometimes over prairies of seaweed that were quite arduous to cross . in all honesty , i was dead tired by the time i spotted a hazy glow half a mile away , cutting through the darkness of the waters . it was the nautilus 's beacon . within twenty minutes we would be on board , and there i could breathe easy again -- because my tank 's current air supply seemed to be quite low in oxygen . but i was reckoning without an encounter that slightly delayed our arrival .",109
"here a question popped into my head . how did the commander of this aquatic residence go about it ? did he obtain air using chemical methods , releasing the oxygen contained in potassium chlorate by heating it , meanwhile absorbing the carbon dioxide with potassium hydroxide ? if so , he would have to keep up some kind of relationship with the shore , to come by the materials needed for such an operation . did he simply limit himself to storing the air in high - pressure tanks and then dispense it according to his crew 's needs ? perhaps . or , proceeding in a more convenient , more economical , and consequently more probable fashion , was he satisfied with merely returning to breathe at the surface of the water like a cetacean , renewing his oxygen supply every twenty - four hours ? in any event , whatever his method was , it seemed prudent to me that he use this method without delay .",168
"equipped with picks , some ten men climbed onto the nautilus 's sides and cracked loose the ice around the ship 's lower plating , which was soon set free . this operation was swiftly executed because the fresh ice was still thin . we all reentered the interior . the main ballast tanks were filled with the water that had n't yet congealed at our line of flotation . the nautilus submerged without delay .",74
"in the morning , when they entered milady ’s chamber they had brought her breakfast . now , she thought , they could not long delay coming to clear the table , and that felton would then reappear .",25
"if any castaways had landed on the coast , it was to be feared they were without resources , and it was therefore the more necessary to carry help to them without delay .",32
