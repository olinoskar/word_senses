"i waited till the last deep and full vibration had expired -- till the tide of talk , checked an instant , had resumed its flow ; i then quitted my sheltered corner and made my exit by the side - door , which was fortunately near .",32
"i was left alone . but how was it possible for a man of my undecided turn of mind to argue successfully with so irascible a person as the professor ? with this persuasion i was hurrying away to my own little retreat upstairs , when the street door creaked upon its hinges ; heavy feet made the whole flight of stairs to shake ; and the master of the house , passing rapidly through the dining - room , threw himself in haste into his own sanctum . but on his rapid way he had found time to fling his hazel stick into a corner , his rough broadbrim upon the table , and these few emphatic words at his nephew :",105

"the front door was open , so we rushed in and hurried from room to room to the amazement of a doddering old manservant , who met us in the passage . there was no light save in the dining - room , but holmes caught up the lamp and left no corner of the house unexplored . no sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing . on the upper floor , however , one of the bedroom doors was locked .",52

""" yes , professor , the sea supplies all my needs . sometimes i cast my nets in our wake , and i pull them up ready to burst . sometimes i go hunting right in the midst of this element that has long seemed so far out of man 's reach , and i corner the game that dwells in my underwater forests . like the flocks of old proteus , king neptune 's shepherd , my herds graze without fear on the ocean 's immense prairies . there i own vast properties that i harvest myself , and which are forever sown by the hand of the creator of all things .

"some thirty pictures by the masters , uniformly framed and separated by gleaming panoplies of arms , adorned walls on which were stretched tapestries of austere design . there i saw canvases of the highest value , the likes of which i had marveled at in private european collections and art exhibitions . the various schools of the old masters were represented by a raphael madonna , a virgin by leonardo da vinci , a nymph by correggio , a woman by titian , an adoration of the magi by veronese , an assumption of the virgin by murillo , a holbein portrait , a monk by velazquez , a martyr by ribera , a village fair by rubens , two flemish landscapes by teniers , three little genre paintings by gerard dow , metsu , and paul potter , two canvases by gericault and prud'hon , plus seascapes by backhuysen and vernet . among the works of modern art were pictures signed by delacroix , ingres , decamps , troyon , meissonier , daubigny , etc . , and some wonderful miniature statues in marble or bronze , modeled after antiquity 's finest originals , stood on their pedestals in the corners of this magnificent museum . as the nautilus 's commander had predicted , my mind was already starting to fall into that promised state of stunned amazement .",202
"captain nemo fell silent and seemed lost in reverie . i regarded him with intense excitement , silently analyzing his strange facial expression . leaning his elbow on the corner of a valuable mosaic table , he no longer saw me , he had forgotten my very presence .",29
"in some places , the wind , eddying round the corners , formed the snow into tall whirling columns , resembling those waterspouts which turn round on their base , and which vessels attack with a shot from a gun .",10
"i followed captain nemo , who , via one of the doors cut into the lounge 's canted corners , led me back down the ship 's gangways . he took me to the bow , and there i found not just a cabin but an elegant stateroom with a bed , a washstand , and various other furnishings .",18
"i crept forward through the nautilus 's dark gangways , pausing after each step to curb the pounding of my heart . i arrived at the corner door of the lounge . i opened it gently . the lounge was plunged in profound darkness . chords from the organ were reverberating faintly . captain nemo was there . he did n't see me . even in broad daylight i doubt that he would have noticed me , so completely was he immersed in his trance .",26

"if they each lay hid in a corner , and each fired at one of us , they would soon be masters of the colony ! """,7
"but there were ample signs that i had not come upon a false scent . this was certainly where the man lived . some blankets rolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which neolithic man had once slumbered . the ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate . beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket half - full of water . a litter of empty tins showed that the place had been occupied for some time , and i saw , as my eyes became accustomed to the checkered light , a pannikin and a half - full bottle of spirits standing in the corner . in the middle of the hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table , and upon this stood a small cloth bundle -- the same , no doubt , which i had seen through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy . it contained a loaf of bread , a tinned tongue , and two tins of preserved peaches . as i set it down again , after having examined it , my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it . i raised it , and this was what i read , roughly scrawled in pencil:--",113

"beyond the fortifications through which athos had made a breach in order to get out , and which were composed of fagots , planks , and empty casks , heaped up according to all the rules of the strategic art , they found , swimming in puddles of oil and wine , the bones and fragments of all the hams they had eaten ; while a heap of broken bottles filled the whole left - hand corner of the cellar , and a tun , the cock of which was left running , was yielding , by this means , the last drop of its blood .",76

"alice was not a bit hurt , and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment : she looked up , but it was all dark overhead ; before her was another long passage , and the white rabbit was still in sight , hurrying down it . there was not a moment to be lost : away went alice like the wind , and was just in time to hear it say , as it turned a corner , ' oh my ears and whiskers , how late it 's getting !

"after we had dined , or rather supped , i ordered friday to take one of the canoes , and go and fetch our muskets and other firearms , which , for want of time , we had left upon the place of battle ; and the next day i ordered him to go and bury the dead bodies of the savages , which lay open to the sun , and would presently be offensive . i also ordered him to bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast , which i could not think of doing myself ; nay , i could not bear to see them if i went that way ; all which he punctually performed , and effaced the very appearance of the savages being there ; so that when i went again , i could scarce know where it was , otherwise than by the corner of the wood pointing to the place .",150

"while d’artagnan was examining mme . bonacieux , and was , as we have said , close to her , he saw on the ground a fine cambric handkerchief , which he picked up , as was his habit , and at the corner of which he recognized the same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had nearly caused him and aramis to cut each other ’s throat .",43
"at the sixth cabaret , then , as we said , d’artagnan stopped , asked for a bottle of wine of the best quality , and placing himself in the darkest corner of the room , determined thus to wait till daylight ; but this time again his hopes were disappointed , and although he listened with all his ears , he heard nothing , amid the oaths , coarse jokes , and abuse which passed between the laborers , servants , and carters who comprised the honorable society of which he formed a part , which could put him upon the least track of her who had been stolen from him .",31
