"and in all honesty , i confess that this venturesome excursion was far from displeasing to me . i ca n't express the intensity of my amazement at the beauties of these new regions . the ice struck superb poses . here , its general effect suggested an oriental town with countless minarets and mosques . there , a city in ruins , flung to the ground by convulsions in the earth . these views were varied continuously by the sun 's oblique rays , or were completely swallowed up by gray mists in the middle of blizzards . then explosions , cave - ins , and great iceberg somersaults would occur all around us , altering the scenery like the changing landscape in a diorama .",37

"under these conditions the barometer generally stayed quite low . it fell as far as 73.5 centimeters . our compass indications no longer offered any guarantees . the deranged needles would mark contradictory directions as we approached the southern magnetic pole , which does n't coincide with the south pole proper . in fact , according to the astronomer hansteen , this magnetic pole is located fairly close to latitude 70 degrees and longitude 130 degrees , or abiding by the observations of louis - isidore duperrey , in longitude 135 degrees and latitude 70 degrees 30 ' . hence we had to transport compasses to different parts of the ship , take many readings , and strike an average . often we could chart our course only by guesswork , a less than satisfactory method in the midst of these winding passageways whose landmarks change continuously .",117
