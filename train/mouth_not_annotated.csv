"has either of them confided anything to you by word of mouth ? """,11
obliquely to the oval of the island ran a stream through a wide meadow falling into the sea on the west by a narrow mouth .,24
cries of admiration issued from every mouth .,6
"during our absence the nets had been spread , and i observed with fascination the fish just hauled on board . the antarctic seas serve as a refuge for an extremely large number of migratory fish that flee from storms in the subpolar zones , in truth only to slide down the gullets of porpoises and seals . i noted some one - decimeter southern bullhead , a species of whitish cartilaginous fish overrun with bluish gray stripes and armed with stings , then some antarctic rabbitfish three feet long , the body very slender , the skin a smooth silver white , the head rounded , the topside furnished with three fins , the snout ending in a trunk that curved back toward the mouth . i sampled its flesh but found it tasteless , despite conseil 's views , which were largely approving .",125
the king looked at the cardinal as if to interrogate him ; but he had not time to address any question to him -- a cry of admiration burst from every mouth .,31
""" come , come ! "" said milady , lifting hers to her mouth , "" do as i do . """,13
"as for marine mammals , on passing by the mouth of the adriatic sea , i thought i recognized two or three sperm whales equipped with the single dorsal fin denoting the genus physeter , some pilot whales from the genus globicephalus exclusive to the mediterranean , the forepart of the head striped with small distinct lines , and also a dozen seals with white bellies and black coats , known by the name monk seals and just as solemn as if they were three - meter dominicans .",9
""" our good genius , neb , our good genius , who will shut his mouth for him , if he so much as pretends to open it ! """,15
""" monsieur has promised me not to open his mouth about the procurator ’s wife , and not to say a word of the wound ? """,9
"between the river 's mouth and the end of the cliff , eddies of wind whirled and gusts from this maelstrom lashed the water which ran through the narrow valley .",4
""" well said , "" cried aramis ; "" you do n’t often speak , athos , but when you do speak , it is like st . john of the golden mouth .",32
"during that day a fearsome school of sharks provided us with an escort . dreadful animals that teem in these seas and make them extremely dangerous . there were port jackson sharks with a brown back , a whitish belly , and eleven rows of teeth , bigeye sharks with necks marked by a large black spot encircled in white and resembling an eye , and isabella sharks whose rounded snouts were strewn with dark speckles . often these powerful animals rushed at the lounge window with a violence less than comforting . by this point ned land had lost all self - control . he wanted to rise to the surface of the waves and harpoon the monsters , especially certain smooth - hound sharks whose mouths were paved with teeth arranged like a mosaic , and some big five - meter tiger sharks that insisted on personally provoking him . but the nautilus soon picked up speed and easily left astern the fastest of these man - eaters .",127
"oh , madam , when you put bread and cheese , instead of burnt porridge , into these children 's mouths , you may indeed feed their vile bodies , but you little think how you starve their immortal souls ! """,20
"my blood turned cold in my veins ! i saw that we were under threat from a fearsome pair of sharks . they were blue sharks , dreadful man - eaters with enormous tails , dull , glassy stares , and phosphorescent matter oozing from holes around their snouts . they were like monstrous fireflies that could thoroughly pulverize a man in their iron jaws ! i do n't know if conseil was busy with their classification , but as for me , i looked at their silver bellies , their fearsome mouths bristling with teeth , from a viewpoint less than scientific-- more as a victim than as a professor of natural history .",92
""" well , "" replied d’artagnan , bending his mouth to athos ’s ear , and lowering his voice , "" milady is marked with a fleur - de - lis upon her shoulder ! """,9
"then cyrus harding , having ended his survey , re - ascended , drew up the ladder , covered the mouth of the well , and returned thoughtfully to the diningroom , saying to himself,-- "" i have seen nothing , and yet there is something there ! """,20
""" as to the mouth , it delights at times in laughter ; it is disposed to impart all that the brain conceives ; though i daresay it would be silent on much the heart experiences . mobile and flexible , it was never intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of solitude : it is a mouth which should speak much and smile often , and have human affection for its interlocutor .",58
""" can you picture , "" i asked them , "" what this funnel must have been like when it was filled with boiling lava , and the level of that incandescent liquid rose right to the mountain 's mouth , like cast iron up the insides of a furnace ? """,39
"pillars of smoke and flame escaped from the crater ; a hail of scoriae fell on the ground ; but no current of lava burst from the mouth of the volcano , which proved that the volcanic matter had not yet attained the level of the superior orifice of the central shaft .",27
"they were then careful to cover their eyes and mouths with handkerchiefs , for they ran the risk of being blinded and suffocated .",9
""" right into its mouth , my honest neb ! "" replied herbert , "" but you are not afraid that it will shut upon us , are you ? """,4

"being armed with muskets alone , they could do no harm to the settlers , in ambush at the chimneys and the mouth of the mercy ; but , not knowing the latter to be supplied with long - range rifles , they on their side did not believe themselves to be exposed .",22
""" supernatural ! "" exclaimed the sailor , emitting a volume of smoke from his mouth .",15
"it was a squid of colossal dimensions , fully eight meters long . it was traveling backward with tremendous speed in the same direction as the nautilus . it gazed with enormous , staring eyes that were tinted sea green . its eight arms ( or more accurately , feet ) were rooted in its head , which has earned these animals the name cephalopod ; its arms stretched a distance twice the length of its body and were writhing like the serpentine hair of the furies . you could plainly see its 250 suckers , arranged over the inner sides of its tentacles and shaped like semispheric capsules . sometimes these suckers fastened onto the lounge window by creating vacuums against it . the monster 's mouth -- a beak made of horn and shaped like that of a parrot -- opened and closed vertically . its tongue , also of horn substance and armed with several rows of sharp teeth , would flicker out from between these genuine shears . what a freak of nature ! a bird 's beak on a mollusk ! its body was spindle - shaped and swollen in the middle , a fleshy mass that must have weighed 20,000 to 25,000 kilograms . its unstable color would change with tremendous speed as the animal grew irritated , passing successively from bluish gray to reddish brown .",127
"the bank was very equal ; there was no fear that the raft would run aground , and before two o'clock they arrived at the river 's mouth , a few paces from the chimneys .",27
"soon the "" speedy "" reached the point of the islet ; she rounded it with ease ; the mainsail was braced up , and the brig hugging the wind , stood across the mouth of the mercy .",34
"ten curious heads were glued to the tapestry and became pale with fury ; for their ears , closely applied to the door , did not lose a syllable of what he said , while their mouths repeated as he went on , the insulting expressions of the captain to all the people in the antechamber .",36
"loud peals of thunder broke , and could scarcely be distinguished from the rumblings of the mountain , whose mouth vomited forth ignited rocks , which , hurled to more than a thousand feet , burst in the air like shells .",19
"ten days went by in this way . it was only on may 1 that the nautilus openly resumed its northbound course , after raising the bahamas at the mouth of old bahama channel . we then went with the current of the sea 's greatest river , which has its own banks , fish , and temperature . i mean the gulf stream .",29
""" i keep coming back to my idea . we 've got to talk to the captain . when we were in your own country 's seas , you did n't say a word . now that we 're in mine , i intend to speak up . before a few days are out , i figure the nautilus will lie abreast of nova scotia , and from there to newfoundland is the mouth of a large gulf , and the st . lawrence empties into that gulf , and the st . lawrence is my own river , the river running by quebec , my hometown-- and when i think about all this , my gorge rises and my hair stands on end ! honestly , sir , i 'd rather jump overboard ! i ca n't stay here any longer ! i 'm suffocating !
