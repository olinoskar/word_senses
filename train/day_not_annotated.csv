"the blizzard lasted until the next day . it was impossible to stay on the platform . from the lounge , where i was writing up the incidents of this excursion to the polar continent , i could hear the calls of petrel and albatross cavorting in the midst of the turmoil . the nautilus did n't stay idle , and cruising along the coast , it advanced some ten miles farther south amid the half light left by the sun as it skimmed the edge of the horizon .",6

"after two hours of work , reentering to snatch some food and rest , i found a noticeable difference between the clean elastic fluid supplied me by the rouquayrol device and the nautilus 's atmosphere , which was already charged with carbon dioxide . the air had n't been renewed in forty - eight hours , and its life - giving qualities were considerably weakened . meanwhile , after twelve hours had gone by , we had removed from the outlined surface area a slice of ice only one meter thick , hence about 600 cubic meters . assuming the same work would be accomplished every twelve hours , it would still take five nights and four days to see the undertaking through to completion .",117
"the next day , march 26 , i returned to my miner 's trade , working to remove the fifth meter . the ice bank 's side walls and underbelly had visibly thickened . obviously they would come together before the nautilus could break free . for an instant i was gripped by despair . my pick nearly slipped from my hands . what was the point of this digging if i was to die smothered and crushed by this water turning to stone , a torture undreamed of by even the wildest savages ! i felt like i was lying in the jaws of a fearsome monster , jaws irresistibly closing .",2
"by the next day , march 27 , six meters of ice had been torn from the socket . only four meters were left to be removed . that still meant forty - eight hours of work . the air could n't be renewed in the nautilus 's interior . accordingly , that day it kept getting worse .",3
"when i returned on board , i felt half suffocated . what a night ! i 'm unable to depict it . such sufferings are indescribable . the next day i was short - winded . headaches and staggering fits of dizziness made me reel like a drunk . my companions were experiencing the same symptoms . some crewmen were at their last gasp .",29
"night arrived , although it was impossible to distinguish it from day in the cavern .",11
"at break of day the colonists regained in silence the entrance of the cavern , to which they gave the name of "" dakkar grotto , "" in memory of captain nemo .",3
"by then all our past sufferings were forgotten . the memory of that imprisonment under the ice faded from our minds . we had thoughts only of the future . captain nemo no longer appeared , neither in the lounge nor on the platform . the positions reported each day on the world map were put there by the chief officer , and they enabled me to determine the nautilus 's exact heading . now then , that evening it became obvious , much to my satisfaction , that we were returning north by the atlantic route .",49
"the next day , april 1 , when the nautilus rose to the surface of the waves a few minutes before noon , we raised land to the west . it was tierra del fuego , the land of fire , a name given it by early navigators after they saw numerous curls of smoke rising from the natives ' huts . this land of fire forms a huge cluster of islands over thirty leagues long and eighty leagues wide , extending between latitude 53 degrees and 56 degrees south , and between longitude 67 degrees 50 ' and 77 degrees 15 ' west . its coastline looked flat , but high mountains rose in the distance . i even thought i glimpsed mt . sarmiento , whose elevation is 2,070 meters above sea level : a pyramid - shaped block of shale with a very sharp summit , which , depending on whether it 's clear or veiled in vapor , "" predicts fair weather or foul , "" as ned land told me .",2
"the nautilus passed over these lush , luxuriant depths with tremendous speed . near evening it approached the falkland islands , whose rugged summits i recognized the next day . the sea was of moderate depth . so not without good reason , i assumed that these two islands , plus the many islets surrounding them , used to be part of the magellan coastline . the falkland islands were probably discovered by the famous navigator john davis , who gave them the name davis southern islands . later sir richard hawkins called them the maidenland , after the blessed virgin . subsequently , at the beginning of the 18th century , they were named the malouines by fishermen from saint - malo in brittany , then finally dubbed the falklands by the english , to whom they belong today .",28
"for some days the heat was overpowering , and the atmosphere , saturated with electricity , was only cleared by violent storms .",2
"during the course of the next day , april 12 , the nautilus drew near the coast of dutch guiana , by the mouth of the maroni river . there several groups of sea cows were living in family units . these were manatees , which belong to the order sirenia , like the dugong and steller 's sea cow . harmless and unaggressive , these fine animals were six to seven meters long and must have weighed at least 4,000 kilograms each . i told ned land and conseil that farseeing nature had given these mammals a major role to play . in essence , manatees , like seals , are designed to graze the underwater prairies , destroying the clusters of weeds that obstruct the mouths of tropical rivers .",6
"the same day an odd fishing practice further increased the nautilus 's stores , so full of game were these seas . our trawl brought up in its meshes a number of fish whose heads were topped by little oval slabs with fleshy edges . these were suckerfish from the third family of the subbrachian malacopterygia . these flat disks on their heads consist of crosswise plates of movable cartilage , between which the animals can create a vacuum , enabling them to stick to objects like suction cups .",2
"so i begged ned to let me think about it before taking action . if this measure proved fruitless , it could arouse the captain 's suspicions , make our circumstances even more arduous , and jeopardize the canadian 's plans . i might add that i could hardly use our state of health as an argument . except for that grueling ordeal under the ice bank at the south pole , we had never felt better , neither ned , conseil , nor i. the nutritious food , life - giving air , regular routine , and uniform temperature kept illness at bay ; and for a man who did n't miss his past existence on land , for a captain nemo who was at home here , who went where he wished , who took paths mysterious to others if not himself in attaining his ends , i could understand such a life . but we ourselves had n't severed all ties with humanity . for my part , i did n't want my new and unusual research to be buried with my bones . i had now earned the right to pen the definitive book on the sea , and sooner or later i wanted that book to see the light of day .",215

"it was a warm june morning , and the latter day saints were as busy as the bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem . in the fields and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry . down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavily - laden mules , all heading to the west , for the gold fever had broken out in california , and the overland route lay through the city of the elect . there , too , were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands , and trains of tired immigrants , men and horses equally weary of their interminable journey . through all this motley assemblage , threading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider , there galloped lucy ferrier , her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out behind her . she had a commission from her father in the city , and was dashing in as she had done many a time before , with all the fearlessness of youth , thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed . the travel - stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment , and even the unemotional indians , journeying in with their pelties , relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale - faced maiden .",10
