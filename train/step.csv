the young man rose and took a step toward her .,7,"('step', 'pas', 'pasar')",0
""" if you take one step farther , d’artagnan , "" said he , "" we shall cross swords together . """,5,"('step', 'pas', 'pasar')",0
"at that moment , herbert , who had advanced a few steps into the enclosure , drew back hurriedly , and seized harding 's hand .",11,"('step', 'pas', 'paso')",1
""" you will not sign that order , my lord ! "" said felton , making a step toward the duke .",17,"('step', 'pas', 'pasar')",0
athos made a step toward milady .,3,"('step', 'pas', 'pasar')",0
"happily some projections of the granite , forming regular steps , made the descent less perilous .",9,"('step', 'marches', 'escalonar')",2
"making a sign to la houdiniere and cahusac to stop , he alighted from his horse , and went toward these suspected merry companions , hoping , by means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge which concealed his approach , to catch some words of this conversation which appeared so interesting . at ten paces from the hedge he recognized the talkative gascon ; and as he had already perceived that these men were musketeers , he did not doubt that the three others were those called the inseparables ; that is to say , athos , porthos , and aramis .",38,"('step', 'pas', 'paso')",1
"the knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before the tumult ceased , steps approached , the door was opened , and d’artagnan , sword in hand , rushed into the rooms of m. bonacieux , the door of which doubtless acted upon by a spring , closed after him .",17,"('step', 'pas', 'paso')",1
""" ah , this is too much ! "" cried buckingham , making a step toward the door .",14,"('step', 'pas', 'pasar')",0
"i made my way to the central companionway , which led to the platform . i climbed its metal steps , passed through the open hatches , and arrived topside on the nautilus .",19,"('step', 'marches', 'peldaño')",3
at ten o’clock felton came and placed the sentinel . milady recognized his step .,13,"('step', 'pas', 'pasar')",0
"the color mounted to the face of athos , and he made a step toward his eminence .",13,"('step', 'pas', 'pasar')",0
"and kitty , who had not let go the hand of d’artagnan , led him up a little dark , winding staircase , and after ascending about fifteen steps , opened a door .",28,"('step', 'marches', 'escalonar')",2
""" well ! the carriage is at the door ; you bid me adieu ; you mount the step to embrace me a last time ; my brother ’s servant , who comes to fetch me , is told how to proceed ; he makes a sign to the postillion , and we set off at a gallop . """,18,"('step', 'marchepied', 'estribar')",4
""" take one step more , "" said i , "" and in addition to my dishonor , you shall have my death to reproach yourself with . """,3,"('step', 'pas', 'pasar')",0
"at every noise he heard , the simple puritan fancied he recognized the step and voice of milady coming to throw herself into his arms , to accuse herself , and die with him .",13,"('step', 'pas', 'paso')",1
it was eight o'clock in the morning . we had four hours to ourselves before the sun could be productively observed . i guided our steps toward a huge bay that made a crescent - shaped incision in the granite cliffs along the beach .,25,"('step', 'pas', 'paso')",1
""" rue ferou , two steps from here . """,5,"('step', 'pas', 'paso')",1
"everybody had remarked that something had passed between the king and queen ; but both of them had spoken so low that everybody , out of respect , withdrew several steps , so that nobody had heard anything .",30,"('step', 'pas', 'paso')",1
"the canadian leaped up the steps , but i stopped him . a well - known hissing told me that water was entering the ship 's ballast tanks . indeed , in a few moments the nautilus had submerged some meters below the surface of the waves .",5,"('step', 'marches', 'peldaño')",3
"here he is ! "" d’artagnan , walking and soliloquizing , had arrived within a few steps of the hotel d’arguillon and in front of that hotel perceived aramis , chatting gaily with three gentlemen ; but as he had not forgotten that it was in presence of this young man that m. de treville had been so angry in the morning , and as a witness of the rebuke the musketeers had received was not likely to be at all agreeable , he pretended not to see him .",16,"('step', 'pas', 'paso')",1
"milady made one step forward , and then drew back as if she had seen a serpent .",3,"('step', 'pas', 'pasar')",0
"meanwhile captain nemo strolled from one end of the platform to the other , not glancing at me , perhaps not even seeing me . his step was firm but less regular than usual . sometimes he would stop , cross his arms over his chest , and observe the sea . what could he be looking for over that immense expanse ? by then the nautilus lay hundreds of miles from the nearest coast !",26,"('step', 'pas', 'pasar')",0
and he made some steps toward the door .,4,"('step', 'pas', 'paso')",1
""" at length i heard the well - known noise of the door , which opened and shut ; i heard , notwithstanding the thickness of the carpet , a step which made the floor creak ; i saw , notwithstanding the darkness , a shadow which approached my bed . """,30,"('step', 'pas', 'pasar')",0
""" you are right , "" said felton , after having looked at milady from the spot on which he stood without moving a step toward her . "" go and tell lord de winter that his prisoner has fainted -- for this event not having been foreseen , i do n’t know what to do . """,24,"('step', 'pas', 'pasar')",0
"thus , in retracing their steps so as to find some practicable path , much time was employed and fatigue undergone for nothing .",5,"('step', 'pas', 'paso')",1
""" yes , yes , let us fly ! "" repeated mme . bonacieux , but without being able to make a step , glued as she was to the spot by terror .",22,"('step', 'pas', 'pasar')",0
"mme . bonacieux tried to walk , made two steps , and sank upon her knees .",9,"('step', 'pas', 'paso')",1
"there was a moment of silence ; but at length the two englishmen felt ashamed to draw back , and the angrier one descended the five or six steps which led to the cellar , and gave a kick against the door enough to split a wall .",28,"('step', 'marches', 'peldaño')",3
"in the evening , about nine o’clock , at the moment he had made up his mind to go to bed , he heard steps in his corridor .",24,"('step', 'pas', 'paso')",1
"before she went to bed she had pondered , analyzed , turned on all sides , examined on all points , the words , the steps , the gestures , the signs , and even the silence of her interlocutors ; and of this profound , skillful , and anxious study the result was that felton , everything considered , appeared the more vulnerable of her two persecutors .",25,"('step', 'pas', 'paso')",1
"she gave so much vehemence , such magnetic eloquence to this exclamation , that felton in spite of himself advanced some steps into the room .",21,"('step', 'pas', 'paso')",1
"hardened lava and crusted scoria formed a sort of natural staircase of large steps , which would greatly facilitate the ascent to the summit of the mountain .",13,"('step', 'marches', 'escalonar')",2
"captain nemo walked in front , and his companion followed us a few steps to the rear . conseil and i stayed next to each other , as if daydreaming that through our metal carapaces , a little polite conversation might still be possible ! already i no longer felt the bulkiness of my clothes , footwear , and air tank , nor the weight of the heavy sphere inside which my head was rattling like an almond in its shell . once immersed in water , all these objects lost a part of their weight equal to the weight of the liquid they displaced , and thanks to this law of physics discovered by archimedes , i did just fine . i was no longer an inert mass , and i had , comparatively speaking , great freedom of movement .",13,"('step', 'pas', 'paso')",1
"but at the sight of the young man , who detached himself from the wall like a statue walking from its niche , and at the noise of the steps which she heard resound behind her , mme . bonacieux uttered a little cry and fled .",29,"('step', 'pas', 'paso')",1
"d’artagnan , half stupefied , without his doublet , and with his head bound up in a linen cloth , arose then , and urged by the host , began to descend the stairs ; but on arriving at the kitchen , the first thing he saw was his antagonist talking calmly at the step of a heavy carriage , drawn by two large norman horses .",54,"('step', 'marchepied', 'estribar')",4
"captain nemo stopped , straightened up , took a few steps along the platform , and returned to me :",10,"('step', 'pas', 'paso')",1
"the latter -- a pretty girl of about twenty or twenty - two years , active and lively , the true soubrette of a great lady -- jumped from the step upon which , according to the custom of the time , she was seated , and took her way toward the terrace upon which d’artagnan had perceived lubin .",30,"('step', 'marchepied', 'estribar')",4
"thereupon she ran toward the carriage , which had turned round toward the way it came , jumped upon the step , and the carriage drove off .",20,"('step', 'marchepied', 'estribar')",4
"then only she pretended to hear the sound of felton ’s steps , and rising quick as thought , she blushed , as if ashamed of being surprised on her knees .",11,"('step', 'pas', 'paso')",1
"he then made a few steps toward the sea , and his look brightened with extreme animation , but he did not make the slightest attempt to escape .",5,"('step', 'pas', 'paso')",1
"men are hard - hearted , and kind angels only watch o'er the steps of a poor orphan child .",13,"('step', 'pas', 'paso')",1
someone was heard in the corridor ; milady recognized the step of lord de winter .,10,"('step', 'pas', 'pasar')",0
"then as the steps drew near , she became silent for fear of being heard , applying , with a gesture of infinite terror , her beautiful hand to felton ’s mouth .",3,"('step', 'pas', 'paso')",1
"and porthos , turning on his heel , made a step to retire . "" monsieur porthos !",10,"('step', 'pas', 'pasar')",0
""" i am going a few steps farther . """,6,"('step', 'pas', 'paso')",1
"something gurgled and moaned . ere long , steps retreated up the gallery towards the third - storey staircase : a door had lately been made to shut in that staircase ; i heard it open and close , and all was still .",8,"('step', 'pas', 'paso')",1
""" what do you want , monsieur ? "" demanded the musketeer , recoiling a step , and with a foreign accent , which proved to d’artagnan that he was deceived in one of his conjectures .",15,"('step', 'pas', 'pasar')",0
"the musketeer advanced two steps , and pushed d’artagnan aside with his hand .",4,"('step', 'pas', 'paso')",1
"anne of austria took two steps forward . buckingham threw himself at her feet , and before the queen could prevent him , kissed the hem of her robe .",5,"('step', 'pas', 'paso')",1
"at this moment the steps of lord de winter were heard ; but this time the terrible brother - in - law of milady did not content himself , as on the preceding day , with passing before the door and going away again . he paused , exchanged two words with the sentinel ; then the door opened , and he appeared .",4,"('step', 'pas', 'pasar')",0
"the three musketeers therefore did not hesitate to make a step forward . d’artagnan on the contrary remained concealed behind them ; but although the king knew athos , porthos , and aramis personally , he passed before them without speaking or looking -- indeed , as if he had never seen them before .",10,"('step', 'pas', 'pasar')",0
"felton grew pale , and made a step forward , remembering that at the moment he entered milady had a rope in her hand .",7,"('step', 'pas', 'pasar')",0
