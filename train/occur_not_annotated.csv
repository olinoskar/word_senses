"as to going home , shame opposed the best motions that offered to my thoughts , and it immediately occurred to me how i should be laughed at among the neighbours , and should be ashamed to see , not my father and mother only , but even everybody else ; from whence i have since often observed , how incongruous and irrational the common temper of mankind is , especially of youth , to that reason which ought to guide them in such cases — viz . that they are not ashamed to sin , and yet are ashamed to repent ; not ashamed of the action for which they ought justly to be esteemed fools , but are ashamed of the returning , which only can make them be esteemed wise men .",19
