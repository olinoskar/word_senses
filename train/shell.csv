"meanwhile shells fell around us in increasing numbers . some , meeting the liquid surface , would ricochet and vanish into the sea at considerable distances . but none of them reached the nautilus .",1,"('shell', 'boulet', 'obús')",0
"by then the ironclad was no more than three miles off . despite its violent cannonade , captain nemo had n't appeared on the platform . and yet if one of those conical shells had scored a routine hit on the nautilus 's hull , it could have been fatal to him .",33,"('shell', 'boulet', 'obús')",0

"i repaired to my stateroom . the captain and his chief officer stayed on the platform . the propeller was set in motion . the nautilus swiftly retreated , putting us outside the range of the vessel 's shells . but the chase continued , and captain nemo was content to keep his distance .",38,"('shell', 'boulet', 'obús')",0
"i rushed to the window and saw crusts of coral : fungus coral , siphonula coral , alcyon coral , sea anemone from the genus caryophylia , plus myriads of charming fish including greenfish , damselfish , sweepers , snappers , and squirrelfish ; underneath this coral covering i detected some rubble the old dredges had n't been able to tear free-- iron stirrups , anchors , cannons , shells , tackle from a capstan , a stempost , all objects hailing from the wrecked ships and now carpeted in moving flowers .",69,"('shell', 'boulet', 'obús')",0
"at seven o'clock the log told me that the nautilus had reduced speed . i realized that it was letting the warship approach . moreover , the explosions grew more intensely audible . shells furrowed the water around us , drilling through it with an odd hissing sound .",33,"('shell', 'boulet', 'obús')",0

"to be sure , i had confidence in this devoted lad . ordinarily , i never asked whether or not it suited him to go with me on my journeys ; but this time an expedition was at issue that could drag on indefinitely , a hazardous undertaking whose purpose was to hunt an animal that could sink a frigate as easily as a walnut shell ! there was good reason to stop and think , even for the world 's most emotionless man . what would conseil say ?",65,"('shell', 'noix', 'nuez')",2
"after the works of art , natural rarities predominated . they consisted chiefly of plants , shells , and other exhibits from the ocean that must have been captain nemo 's own personal finds . in the middle of the lounge , a jet of water , electrically lit , fell back into a basin made from a single giant clam . the delicately festooned rim of this shell , supplied by the biggest mollusk in the class acephala , measured about six meters in circumference ; so it was even bigger than those fine giant clams given to king françois i by the republic of venice , and which the church of saint - sulpice in paris has made into two gigantic holy - water fonts .",16,"('shell', 'coquille', 'concha')",1

"the shellfish meleagrina , that womb for pearls whose valves are nearly equal in size , has the shape of a round shell with thick walls and a very rough exterior . some of these shells were furrowed with flaky , greenish bands that radiated down from the top . these were the young oysters . the others had rugged black surfaces , measured up to fifteen centimeters in width , and were ten or more years old .",22,"('shell', 'coquille', 'concha')",1
"the mollusk 's two valves were partly open . the captain approached and stuck his dagger vertically between the shells to discourage any ideas about closing ; then with his hands he raised the fringed , membrane - filled tunic that made up the animal 's mantle .",19,"('shell', 'coquille', 'concha')",1

"we were stretched out in this delightful cave for an hour . our conversation , lively at the outset , then languished . a definite drowsiness overcame us . since i saw no good reason to resist the call of sleep , i fell into a heavy doze . i dreamed -- one does n't choose his dreams -- that my life had been reduced to the vegetating existence of a simple mollusk . it seemed to me that this cave made up my double - valved shell . . . .",87,"('shell', 'coquille', 'concha')",1
"how many delightful hours i spent in this way at the lounge window ! how many new specimens of underwater flora and fauna i marveled at beneath the light of our electric beacon ! mushroom - shaped fungus coral , some slate - colored sea anemone including the species thalassianthus aster among others , organ - pipe coral arranged like flutes and just begging for a puff from the god pan , shells unique to this sea that dwell in madreporic cavities and whose bases are twisted into squat spirals , and finally a thousand samples of a polypary i had n't observed until then : the common sponge .",72,"('shell', 'coquille', 'concha')",1
"these polyparies were sticking to rocks , shells of mollusks , and even the stalks of water plants . they adorned the smallest crevices , some sprawling , others standing or hanging like coral outgrowths . i told conseil that sponges are fished up in two ways , either by dragnet or by hand . the latter method calls for the services of a diver , but it 's preferable because it spares the polypary 's tissue , leaving it with a much higher market value .",7,"('shell', 'coquille', 'concha')",1

"i had not gone a hundred paces before incontestable proofs presented themselves . it could not be otherwise , for in the silurian age the seas contained at least fifteen hundred vegetable and animal species . my feet , which had become accustomed to the indurated lava floor , suddenly rested upon a dust composed of the _ debris _ of plants and shells . in the walls were distinct impressions of fucoids and lycopodites . professor liedenbrock could not be mistaken , i thought , and yet he pushed on , with , i suppose , his eyes resolutely shut .",63,"('shell', 'coquille', 'concha')",1
