"it was not so easy to get to cayenne . they knew pretty nearly whereabouts it lay ; but the mountains , rivers , precipices , robbers , savages , were dreadful obstacles in the way . their horses died with fatigue and their provisions were at an end . they subsisted a whole month on wild fruit , till at length they came to a little river bordered with cocoa trees ; the sight of which at once revived their drooping spirits and furnished nourishment for their enfeebled bodies .",31
