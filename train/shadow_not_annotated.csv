"there conseil 's work came to a halt . he did n't have time to finish off the class crustacea through an examination of its stomatopods , amphipods , homopods , isopods , trilobites , branchiopods , ostracods , and entomostraceans . and in order to complete his study of marine articulates , he needed to mention the class cirripedia , which contains water fleas and carp lice , plus the class annelida , which he would have divided without fail into tubifex worms and dorsibranchian worms . but having gone past the shallows of the strait of sicily , the nautilus resumed its usual deep - water speed . from then on , no more mollusks , no more zoophytes , no more articulates . just a few large fish sweeping by like shadows .",134
"we had long lost sight of the sea shore behind the hills of bones . the rash professor , careless of losing his way , hurried me forward . we advanced in silence , bathed in luminous electric fluid . by some phenomenon which i am unable to explain , it lighted up all sides of every object equally . such was its diffusiveness , there being no central point from which the light emanated , that shadows no longer existed . you might have thought yourself under the rays of a vertical sun in a tropical region at noonday and the height of summer . no vapour was visible . the rocks , the distant mountains , a few isolated clumps of forest trees in the distance , presented a weird and wonderful aspect under these totally new conditions of a universal diffusion of light . we were like hoffmann 's shadowless man .",77
by evening we had cleared 200 leagues up the atlantic . shadows gathered and gloom overran the sea until the moon came up .,11
"the sun was already sinking towards the horizon , and the trees threw long shadows on the ground .",14
"i shut the closet to conceal the strange , wraith - like apparel it contained ; which , at this evening hour -- nine o'clock -- gave out certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment .",35
""" well , it was evident from what we have heard that baskerville has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in town . how else could it be known so quickly that it was the northumberland hotel which he had chosen ? if they had followed him the first day i argued that they would follow him also the second . you may have observed that i twice strolled over to the window while dr . mortimer was reading his legend .

""" there is no object in our following them , "" said holmes . "" the shadow has departed and will not return . we must see what further cards we have in our hands and play them with decision . could you swear to that man 's face within the cab ? """,16
"two hours after leaving the nautilus , we had cleared the timberline , and 100 feet above our heads stood the mountain peak , forming a dark silhouette against the brilliant glare that came from its far slope . petrified shrubs rambled here and there in sprawling zigzags . fish rose in a body at our feet like birds startled in tall grass . the rocky mass was gouged with impenetrable crevices , deep caves , unfathomable holes at whose far ends i could hear fearsome things moving around . my blood would curdle as i watched some enormous antenna bar my path , or saw some frightful pincer snap shut in the shadow of some cavity ! a thousand specks of light glittered in the midst of the gloom . they were the eyes of gigantic crustaceans crouching in their lairs , giant lobsters rearing up like spear carriers and moving their claws with a scrap - iron clanking , titanic crabs aiming their bodies like cannons on their carriages , and hideous devilfish intertwining their tentacles like bushes of writhing snakes .",113
""" what are you doing here ? "" asked a tail man , in a harsh voice , who , standing in the shadow , quickly threw the light of a lantern in ayrton 's face .",23
"he shuddered , and for a moment he regretted that he had not told basil the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away . basil would have helped him to resist lord henry 's influence , and the still more poisonous influences that came from his own temperament . the love that he bore him -- for it was really love-- had nothing in it that was not noble and intellectual . it was not that mere physical admiration of beauty that is born of the senses and that dies when the senses tire . it was such love as michelangelo had known , and montaigne , and winckelmann , and shakespeare himself . yes , basil could have saved him . but it was too late now . the past could always be annihilated . regret , denial , or forgetfulness could do that . but the future was inevitable . there were passions in him that would find their terrible outlet , dreams that would make the shadow of their evil real .",173
"at certain turns in the trail we were going along , the lake appeared in its full expanse . the ship 's beacon lit up that whole placid surface , which experienced neither ripples nor undulations . the nautilus lay perfectly still . on its platform and on the embankment , crewmen were bustling around , black shadows that stood out clearly in the midst of the luminous air .",57
"before i had time to express the surprise this new proposition caused me , a camera was carried into the lounge at captain nemo 's request . the liquid setting , electrically lit , unfolded with perfect clarity through the wide - open panels . no shadows , no blurs , thanks to our artificial light . not even sunshine could have been better for our purposes . with the thrust of its propeller curbed by the slant of its fins , the nautilus stood still . the camera was aimed at the scenery on the ocean floor , and in a few seconds we had a perfect negative .",46
"i likewise marveled at the numerous medusas , including the most beautiful of their breed , the compass jellyfish , unique to the falkland seas . some of these jellyfish were shaped like very smooth , semispheric parasols with russet stripes and fringes of twelve neat festoons . others looked like upside - down baskets from which wide leaves and long red twigs were gracefully trailing . they swam with quiverings of their four leaflike arms , letting the opulent tresses of their tentacles dangle in the drift . i wanted to preserve a few specimens of these delicate zoophytes , but they were merely clouds , shadows , illusions , melting and evaporating outside their native element .",107
"if i dared , i 'd touch you , to see if you are substance or shadow , you elf!--but i 'd as soon offer to take hold of a blue _ ignis fatuus _ light in a marsh .",16
"at six o'clock in the morning , january 8 , i climbed onto the platform . the morning shadows were lifting . the island was soon on view through the dissolving mists , first its beaches , then its summits .",18
"in the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the sierra blanco . as far as the eye can reach stretches the great flat plain - land , all dusted over with patches of alkali , and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes . on the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks , with their rugged summits flecked with snow . in this great stretch of country there is no sign of life , nor of anything appertaining to life . there is no bird in the steel - blue heaven , no movement upon the dull , grey earth — above all , there is absolute silence . listen as one may , there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness ; nothing but silence — complete and heart - subduing silence . it has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain . that is hardly true . looking down from the sierra blanco , one sees a pathway traced out across the desert , which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance . it is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers . here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun , and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali . approach , and examine them ! they are bones : some large and coarse , others smaller and more delicate . the former have belonged to oxen , and the latter to men . for fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside .",134
""" that 's better , "" said he , seeing the shadow rise from my face . "" and now tell me the result of your visit to mrs . laura lyons -- it was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you had gone , for i am already aware that she is the one person in coombe tracey who might be of service to us in the matter . in fact , if you had not gone to - day it is exceedingly probable that i should have gone to - morrow .

divine justice pursued its course ; disasters came thick on me : i was forced to pass through the valley of the shadow of death . _ his _ chastisements are mighty ; and one smote me which has humbled me for ever .,22
milady heard these few words and caught at a shadow of hope .,9
the troop of friends saw it gain the opposite bank ; the figures were defined like black shadows on the red - tinted horizon .,17
"sibyl vane tossed her head and laughed . "" we do n't want him any more , mother . prince charming rules life for us now .

""" and this , "" added elder william hitch , "" this is why the jealousy of congress has been aroused against us ! why have the soldiers of the union invaded the soil of utah ? why has brigham young , our chief , been imprisoned , in contempt of all justice ? shall we yield to force ? never ! driven from vermont , driven from illinois , driven from ohio , driven from missouri , driven from utah , we shall yet find some independent territory on which to plant our tents . and you , my brother , "" continued the elder , fixing his angry eyes upon his single auditor , "" will you not plant yours there , too , under the shadow of our flag ?

"ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes , jefferson hope had the scanty provisions and water , while lucy had a small bundle containing a few of her more valued possessions . opening the window very slowly and carefully , they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night , and then one by one passed through into the little garden . with bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it , and gained the shelter of the hedge , which they skirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfields . they had just reached this point when the young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the shadow , where they lay silent and trembling .",119

"how strange a chequer - work of providence is the life of man ! and by what secret different springs are the affections hurried about , as different circumstances present ! to - day we love what to - morrow we hate ; to - day we seek what to - morrow we shun ; to - day we desire what to - morrow we fear , nay , even tremble at the apprehensions of . this was exemplified in me , at this time , in the most lively manner imaginable ; for i , whose only affliction was that i seemed banished from human society , that i was alone , circumscribed by the boundless ocean , cut off from mankind , and condemned to what i call silent life ; that i was as one whom heaven thought not worthy to be numbered among the living , or to appear among the rest of his creatures ; that to have seen one of my own species would have seemed to me a raising me from death to life , and the greatest blessing that heaven itself , next to the supreme blessing of salvation , could bestow ; i say , that i should now tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a man , and was ready to sink into the ground at but the shadow or silent appearance of a man having set his foot in the island .",229
"another unusual effect . heavy clouds passed above us , forming and fading swiftly . but after thinking it over , i realized that these so - called clouds were caused simply by the changing densities of the long ground swells , and i even spotted the foaming "" white caps "" that their breaking crests were proliferating over the surface of the water . lastly , i could n't help seeing the actual shadows of large birds passing over our heads , swiftly skimming the surface of the sea .",74

"in the midst of the watery mass , brightly lit by our electric beams , there snaked past those one - meter lampreys that are common to nearly every clime . a type of ray from the genus oxyrhynchus , five feet wide , had a white belly with a spotted , ash - gray back and was carried along by the currents like a huge , wide - open shawl . other rays passed by so quickly i could n't tell if they deserved that name "" eagle ray "" coined by the ancient greeks , or those designations of "" rat ray , "" "" bat ray , "" and "" toad ray "" that modern fishermen have inflicted on them . dogfish known as topes , twelve feet long and especially feared by divers , were racing with each other . looking like big bluish shadows , thresher sharks went by , eight feet long and gifted with an extremely acute sense of smell . dorados from the genus sparus , some measuring up to thirteen decimeters , appeared in silver and azure costumes encircled with ribbons , which contrasted with the dark color of their fins ; fish sacred to the goddess venus , their eyes set in brows of gold ; a valuable species that patronizes all waters fresh or salt , equally at home in rivers , lakes , and oceans , living in every clime , tolerating any temperature , their line dating back to prehistoric times on this earth yet preserving all its beauty from those far - off days . magnificent sturgeons , nine to ten meters long and extremely fast , banged their powerful tails against the glass of our panels , showing bluish backs with small brown spots ; they resemble sharks , without equaling their strength , and are encountered in every sea ; in the spring they delight in swimming up the great rivers , fighting the currents of the volga , danube , po , rhine , loire , and oder , while feeding on herring , mackerel , salmon , and codfish ; although they belong to the class of cartilaginous fish , they rate as a delicacy ; they 're eaten fresh , dried , marinated , or salt - preserved , and in olden times they were borne in triumph to the table of the roman epicure lucullus . but whenever the nautilus drew near the surface , those denizens of the mediterranean i could observe most productively belonged to the sixty - third genus of bony fish . these were tuna from the genus scomber , blue - black on top , silver on the belly armor , their dorsal stripes giving off a golden gleam . they are said to follow ships in search of refreshing shade from the hot tropical sun , and they did just that with the nautilus , as they had once done with the vessels of the count de la pérouse . for long hours they competed in speed with our submersible . i could n't stop marveling at these animals so perfectly cut out for racing , their heads small , their bodies sleek , spindle - shaped , and in some cases over three meters long , their pectoral fins gifted with remarkable strength , their caudal fins forked . like certain flocks of birds , whose speed they equal , these tuna swim in triangle formation , which prompted the ancients to say they 'd boned up on geometry and military strategy . and yet they ca n't escape the provençal fishermen , who prize them as highly as did the ancient inhabitants of turkey and italy ; and these valuable animals , as oblivious as if they were deaf and blind , leap right into the marseilles tuna nets and perish by the thousands .",148
