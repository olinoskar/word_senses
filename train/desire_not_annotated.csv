"my first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this moor , to get something for our subsistence on board ; for i told him we must not presume to eat of our patron ’s bread . he said that was true ; so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit , and three jars of fresh water , into the boat . i knew where my patron ’s case of bottles stood , which it was evident , by the make , were taken out of some english prize , and i conveyed them into the boat while the moor was on shore , as if they had been there before for our master . i conveyed also a great lump of beeswax into the boat , which weighed about half a hundred - weight , with a parcel of twine or thread , a hatchet , a saw , and a hammer , all of which were of great use to us afterwards , especially the wax , to make candles . another trick i tried upon him , which he innocently came into also : his name was ismael , which they call muley , or moely ; so i called to him—“moely , ” said i , “ our patron ’s guns are on board the boat ; can you not get a little powder and shot ? it may be we may kill some alcamies ( a fowl like our curlews ) for ourselves , for i know he keeps the gunner ’s stores in the ship . ” “ yes , ” says he , “ i ’ll bring some ; ” and accordingly he brought a great leather pouch , which held a pound and a half of powder , or rather more ; and another with shot , that had five or six pounds , with some bullets , and put all into the boat . at the same time i had found some powder of my master ’s in the great cabin , with which i filled one of the large bottles in the case , which was almost empty , pouring what was in it into another ; and thus furnished with everything needful , we sailed out of the port to fish . the castle , which is at the entrance of the port , knew who we were , and took no notice of us ; and we were not above a mile out of the port before we hauled in our sail and set us down to fish . the wind blew from the n.n.e . , which was contrary to my desire , for had it blown southerly i had been sure to have made the coast of spain , and at least reached to the bay of cadiz ; but my resolutions were , blow which way it would , i would be gone from that horrid place where i was , and leave the rest to fate .",449
"yet such was the fright i had taken of the moors , and the dreadful apprehensions i had of falling into their hands , that i would not stop , or go on shore , or come to an anchor ; the wind continuing fair till i had sailed in that manner five days ; and then the wind shifting to the southward , i concluded also that if any of our vessels were in chase of me , they also would now give over ; so i ventured to make to the coast , and came to an anchor in the mouth of a little river , i knew not what , nor where , neither what latitude , what country , what nation , or what river . i neither saw , nor desired to see any people ; the principal thing i wanted was fresh water . we came into this creek in the evening , resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark , and discover the country ; but as soon as it was quite dark , we heard such dreadful noises of the barking , roaring , and howling of wild creatures , of we knew not what kinds , that the poor boy was ready to die with fear , and begged of me not to go on shore till day .",135
