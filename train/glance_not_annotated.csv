"a quarter of an hour afterwards , amidst an extraordinary turmoil of applause , sibyl vane stepped on to the stage . yes , she was certainly lovely to look at-- one of the loveliest creatures , lord henry thought , that he had ever seen . there was something of the fawn in her shy grace and startled eyes . a faint blush , like the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver , came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded enthusiastic house . she stepped back a few paces and her lips seemed to tremble . basil hallward leaped to his feet and began to applaud . motionless , and as one in a dream , sat dorian gray , gazing at her . lord henry peered through his glasses , murmuring , "" charming ! charming ! """,83
"he and miss wilson took the liberty of falling in love with each other -- at least tedo and i thought so ; we surprised sundry tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of ' la belle passion , ' and i promise you the public soon had the benefit of our discovery ; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our dead - weights from the house .",27
"at these words the reclining figure rose , and the electric light fell upon his countenance ; a magnificent head , the forehead high , the glance commanding , beard white , hair abundant and falling over the shoulders .",26
"st . john said these words as he pronounced his sermons , with a quiet , deep voice ; with an unflushed cheek , and a coruscating radiance of glance .",29
"a sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor . crouching among the stones we stared intently at the silver - tipped bank in front of us . the steps grew louder , and through the fog , as through a curtain , there stepped the man whom we were awaiting . he looked round him in surprise as he emerged into the clear , starlit night . then he came swiftly along the path , passed close to where we lay , and went on up the long slope behind us . as he walked he glanced continually over either shoulder , like a man who is ill at ease .",99
""" who knew that you were going to the northumberland hotel ? "" asked holmes , glancing keenly across at our visitor .",16
"d’artagnan glanced down at his boots , all covered with mud ; but that same glance fell upon the shoes and stockings of the mercer , and it might have been said they had been dipped in the same mud heap . both were stained with splashes of mud of the same appearance .",1

"during the examination of milady by the officer , as may well be imagined , milady on her part was not less scrutinizing in her glances .",25
"he winced and , taking up from the table an oval glass framed in ivory cupids , one of lord henry 's many presents to him , glanced hurriedly into its polished depths . no line like that warped his red lips . what did it mean ?",27
"from that moment she watched all his actions , all his words , from the simplest glance of his eyes to his gestures -- even to a breath that could be interpreted as a sigh .",16
""" might i trouble you for it -- the inside page , please , with the leading articles ? "" he glanced swiftly over it , running his eyes up and down the columns . "" capital article this on free trade . permit me to give you an extract from it . ' you may be cajoled into imagining that your own special trade or your own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff , but it stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run keep away wealth from the country , diminish the value of our imports , and lower the general conditions of life in this island . ' what do you think of that , watson ? "" cried holmes in high glee , rubbing his hands together with satisfaction . "" do n't you think that is an admirable sentiment ? """,21
"athos dwelt in the rue ferou , within two steps of the luxembourg . his apartment consisted of two small chambers , very nicely fitted up , in a furnished house , the hostess of which , still young and still really handsome , cast tender glances uselessly at him .",46

"lestrade glanced at his note - book . "" john rance , "" he said . "" he is off duty now . you will find him at 46 , audley court , kennington park gate . """,1
lestrade and gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile .,3
"and then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had been infused into it concerning heaven and hell ; and for the first time it recoiled , baffled ; and for the first time glancing behind , on each side , and before it , it saw all round an unfathomed gulf : it felt the one point where it stood -- the present ; all the rest was formless cloud and vacant depth ; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering , and plunging amid that chaos .",37
""" the writing on the wall was done with a man 's forefinger dipped in blood . my glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing it , which would not have been the case if the man 's nail had been trimmed . i gathered up some scattered ash from the floor . it was dark in colour and flakey — such an ash as is only made by a trichinopoly . i have made a special study of cigar ashes — in fact , i have written a monograph upon the subject . i flatter myself that i can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand , either of cigar or of tobacco . it is just in such details that the skilled detective differs from the gregson and lestrade type . """,109
"go up to your own room ; think over all i have said , and , jane , cast a glance on my sufferings -- think of me . """,20
"words might be heard at a distance through all these open doors . then , while passing , he had cast a rapid , investigating glance into the kitchen ; and he was obliged to confess to himself , to the shame of the procurator ’s wife and his own regret , that he did not see that fire , that animation , that bustle , which when a good repast is on foot prevails generally in that sanctuary of good living .",25
"arrows that continually glanced off from mr . rochester 's breast and fell harmless at his feet , might , i knew , if shot by a surer hand , have quivered keen in his proud heart -- have called love into his stern eye , and softness into his sardonic face ; or , better still , without weapons a silent conquest might have been won .",3
""" how provoking ! "" exclaimed miss ingram : "" you tiresome monkey ! "" ( apostrophising adele ) , "" who perched you up in the window to give false intelligence ? "" and she cast on me an angry glance , as if i were in fault .",41
"he looked up the pass and down the hollow ; his glance wandered away with the stream , and returned to traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it : he removed his hat , let the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow .",11
"i was dumb still . he bent his head a little towards me , and with a single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes .",19
"the last rays of the sun gleamed through the thick foliage and glanced on the little waterfall , making the spray sparkle with all the colors of the rainbow .",12
"ayrton alone , by a supreme effort , from time to time raised his head , and cast a despairing glance over the desert ocean .",20
"during the time which lord de winter took to shut the door , close a shutter , and draw a chair near to his sister - in - law ’s fauteuil , milady , anxiously thoughtful , plunged her glance into the depths of possibility , and discovered all the plan , of which she could not even obtain a glance as long as she was ignorant into whose hands she had fallen .",60
"my eye met his as the idea crossed my mind : he seemed to read the glance , answering as if its import had been spoken as well as imagined--",16
"his glance seemed to rest fondly for the last time on these masterpieces of art and of nature , to which he had limited his horizon during a sojourn of so many years in the abysses of the seas .",1
"a short gallop brought them to the road of chaillot ; the day began to decline , carriages were passing and repassing . d’artagnan , keeping at some distance from his friends , darted a scrutinizing glance into every carriage that appeared , but saw no face with which he was acquainted .",36
"his head hanging down , his eye dull , his speech slow and painful , athos would look for hours together at his bottle , his glass , or at grimaud , who , accustomed to obey him by signs , read in the faint glance of his master his least desire , and satisfied it immediately .",45
"at this moment a flock of birds , of a small size and pretty plumage , with long glancing tails , dispersed themselves among the branches strewing their feathers , which covered the ground as with fine down .",18
""" well , and you want your fortune told ? "" she said , in a voice as decided as her glance , as harsh as her features .",21
"it appeared however to milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening . but whether this was reality or vision , he had this time sufficient self - command not to enter .",11
"the sails and the english flag were hoisted at ten minutes past three . mr . fogg and aouda , who were seated on deck , cast a last glance at the quay , in the hope of espying passepartout . fix was not without his fears lest chance should direct the steps of the unfortunate servant , whom he had so badly treated , in this direction ; in which case an explanation the reverse of satisfactory to the detective must have ensued . but the frenchman did not appear , and , without doubt , was still lying under the stupefying influence of the opium .",29
"he glanced about as if in search of something . "" what are you looking for ? "" she inquired .",1
"these conditions being agreed to , porthos took leave of mme . coquenard . the latter wished to detain him by darting certain tender glances ; but porthos urged the commands of duty , and the procurator ’s wife was obliged to give place to the king . the musketeer returned home hungry and in bad humor .",24
"i see at intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close - set bars of a cage : a vivid , restless , resolute captive is there ; were it but free , it would soar cloud - high . you are still bent on going ? """,5
"no one had a more searching eye than the cardinal de richelieu , and d’artagnan felt this glance run through his veins like a fever .",17
"a glance , however , at his countenance convinced me of his perfect sincerity .",1
""" i am afraid you are disappointed in me , bessie . "" i said this laughing : i perceived that bessie 's glance , though it expressed regard , did in no shape denote admiration .",23
"he cast on me a glance of surprise ; but without answering , he cut a thick slice from his loaf , and gave it to me .",5
"that done , he retired the necessary distance , when , lying on the sand , his eye glanced at the same time at the top of the pole and the crest of the cliff .",18
""" not at all , not at all , mr . gray . ever ready to do anything for you , sir . "" and mr . hubbard tramped downstairs , followed by the assistant , who glanced back at dorian with a look of shy wonder in his rough uncomely face . he had never seen any one so marvellous .",37
""" if it were one of your friends you would hesitate , then ? "" cried milady ; and a threatening glance darted from her eyes .",21
"the moon was set , and it was very dark ; bessie carried a lantern , whose light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw . raw and chill was the winter morning : my teeth chattered as i hastened down the drive .",18
"when a door , at length , closed upon her , my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother ; but he had buried his face in his hands , and i could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears .",12
""" you have not answered my first note . are you indisposed , or have you forgotten the glances you favored me with at the ball of mme . de guise ?",18
""" i want him to play to me , "" cried lord henry , smiling , and he looked down the table and caught a bright answering glance .",27
"the baron entered slowly , sending a scrutinizing glance from milady to the young officer .",8
""" the flame flickers in the eye ; the eye shines like dew ; it looks soft and full of feeling ; it smiles at my jargon : it is susceptible ; impression follows impression through its clear sphere ; where it ceases to smile , it is sad ; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid : that signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness . it turns from me ; it will not suffer further scrutiny ; it seems to deny , by a mocking glance , the truth of the discoveries i have already made,--to disown the charge both of sensibility and chagrin : its pride and reserve only confirm me in my opinion .",85
"then only d’artagnan remembered the languishing glances of kitty , her constantly meeting him in the antechamber , the corridor , or on the stairs , those touches of the hand every time she met him , and her deep sighs ; but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady , he had disdained the soubrette . he whose game is the eagle takes no heed of the sparrow .",6
"to - night i was to be miss miller 's bed - fellow ; she helped me to undress : when laid down i glanced at the long rows of beds , each of which was quickly filled with two occupants ; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished , and amidst silence and complete darkness i fell asleep .",24
"he now furtively raised his eyes : he glanced at me , irresolute , disturbed : he again surveyed the picture .",8
"come , come , madame ! "" cried d’artagnan , seizing her hands , and surveying her with an ardent glance , "" come , be more generous . confide in me . have you not read in my eyes that there is nothing but devotion and sympathy in my heart ? """,20
"sometimes when the cardinal , always on horseback , like the lowest gendarme of the army , cast a pensive glance over those works , so slowly keeping pace with his wishes , which the engineers , brought from all the corners of france , were executing under his orders , if he met a musketeer of the company of treville , he drew near and looked at him in a peculiar manner , and not recognizing in him one of our four companions , he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in another direction .",20
"holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me . "" oh , he mentioned his name , did he ? that was imprudent . what was the name that he mentioned ? """,4
"i wanted to see the invisible thing on which , as we went along , he appeared to fasten a glance fierce and fell . i wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he seemed breasting and resisting .",20
"he glanced quickly round and rose to his feet . "" i beg your pardon . i thought-- """,1
"it promised to be a fine day , and this day was to be poor herbert 's last ! a ray glanced on the table placed near the bed .",21
"hearing a cautious step behind me , i glanced over my shoulder : one of the strangers -- a gentleman , evidently -- was advancing up the chancel .",8
"the cardinal related yesterday while playing with the king , with an air of condolence very displeasing to me , that the day before yesterday those damned musketeers , those daredevils -- he dwelt upon those words with an ironical tone still more displeasing to me -- those braggarts , added he , glancing at me with his tiger - cat ’s eye , had made a riot in the rue ferou in a cabaret , and that a party of his guards ( i thought he was going to laugh in my face ) had been forced to arrest the rioters !",53
""" it depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the county , "" said dr . mortimer . "" a glance at our friend here reveals the rounded head of the celt , which carries inside it the celtic enthusiasm and power of attachment . poor sir charles 's head was of a very rare type , half gaelic , half ivernian in its characteristics . but you were very young when you last saw baskerville hall , were you not ? """,24
"having reached the door , he turned the key and opened it . he did not even glance at the murdered man . he felt that the secret of the whole thing was not to realize the situation . the friend who had painted the fatal portrait to which all his misery had been due had gone out of his life . that was enough .",17
the young heir glanced round with a gloomy face .,3
"yes , the poor man may be expected to leave me a widow , any hour , "" continued she , throwing a significant glance at porthos .",24
"the words in these introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes , and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray ; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast ; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking .",46
"i well remembered all ; language , glance , and tone seemed at the moment vividly renewed .",7
he had risen and paced the room as he spoke . now he halted in the recess of the window . there was such a ring of conviction in his voice that i glanced up in surprise .,33
"he was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees , considering how he should broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon his , and looking up , he saw her standing beside him . one glance at her pale , frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed .",42
"holmes was silent , but his little darting glances showed me the interest which he took in our curious companion .",8
"motionless , with her burning and fixed glances , in her solitary apartment , how well the outbursts of passion which at times escape from the depths of her chest with her respiration , accompany the sound of the surf which rises , growls , roars , and breaks itself like an eternal and powerless despair against the rocks on which is built this dark and lofty castle !",7
"the words took away my breath for an instant , but a glance at the placid face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no surprise was intended .",12
"mrs . vane glanced at her , and with one of those false theatrical gestures that so often become a mode of second nature to a stage - player , clasped her in her arms . at this moment , the door opened and a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room . he was thick - set of figure , and his hands and feet were large and somewhat clumsy in movement . he was not so finely bred as his sister . one would hardly have guessed the close relationship that existed between them . mrs . vane fixed her eyes on him and intensified her smile . she mentally elevated her son to the dignity of an audience . she felt sure that the tableau was interesting .",3
"meanwhile captain nemo strolled from one end of the platform to the other , not glancing at me , perhaps not even seeing me . his step was firm but less regular than usual . sometimes he would stop , cross his arms over his chest , and observe the sea . what could he be looking for over that immense expanse ? by then the nautilus lay hundreds of miles from the nearest coast !",15
"my tale draws to its close : one word respecting my experience of married life , and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names have most frequently recurred in this narrative , and i have done .",19
"how hurried was their first glance ! but how they fix ! how he starts ! how he suddenly and vehemently clasps in both arms the form he dared not , a moment since , touch with his finger !",5
milady saw at a single glance all the painful feelings she inspired in felton by dwelling on every detail of her recital ; but she would not spare him a single pang .,5
"they went out into the flickering , wind - blown sunlight and strolled down the dreary euston road . the passersby glanced in wonder at the sullen heavy youth who , in coarse , ill - fitting clothes , was in the company of such a graceful , refined - looking girl . he was like a common gardener walking with a rose .",21
"jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive glance of some stranger . he had that dislike of being stared at , which comes on geniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace . sibyl , however , was quite unconscious of the effect she was producing . her love was trembling in laughter on her lips . she was thinking of prince charming , and , that she might think of him all the more , she did not talk of him , but prattled on about the ship in which jim was going to sail , about the gold he was certain to find , about the wonderful heiress whose life he was to save from the wicked , red - shirted bushrangers . for he was not to remain a sailor , or a supercargo , or whatever he was going to be . oh , no ! a sailor 's existence was dreadful . fancy being cooped up in a horrid ship , with the hoarse , hump - backed waves trying to get in , and a black wind blowing the masts down and tearing the sails into long screaming ribands !",11
"the prediction of the mormon was only too well fulfilled . whether it was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which she had been forced , poor lucy never held up her head again , but pined away and died within a month . her sottish husband , who had married her principally for the sake of john ferrier 's property , did not affect any great grief at his bereavement ; but his other wives mourned over her , and sat up with her the night before the burial , as is the mormon custom . they were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning , when , to their inexpressible fear and astonishment , the door was flung open , and a savage - looking , weather - beaten man in tattered garments strode into the room . without a glance or a word to the cowering women , he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of lucy ferrier . stooping over her , he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead , and then , snatching up her hand , he took the wedding - ring from her finger . "" she shall not be buried in that , "" he cried with a fierce snarl , and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone . so strange and so brief was the episode , that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it , had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared .",154
""" well , i 'm glad to hear you say so , "" said sir henry , glancing with some surprise at my friend . "" i do n't pretend to know much about these things , and i 'd be a better judge of a horse or a steer than of a picture . i did n't know that you found time for such things . """,17
"gregson and lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this proposition rather a bold one ; but holmes at once took the prisoner at his word , and loosened the towel which we had bound round his ancles . he rose and stretched his legs , as though to assure himself that they were free once more . i remember that i thought to myself , as i eyed him , that i had seldom seen a more powerfully built man ; and his dark sunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was as formidable as his personal strength .",4
""" yes , i was chasing a cyclopides . he is very rare and seldom found in the late autumn . what a pity that i should have missed him ! "" he spoke unconcernedly , but his small light eyes glanced incessantly from the girl to me .",41
"lady ruxton glanced at him curiously . "" you must come and explain that to me some afternoon , lord henry . it sounds a fascinating theory , "" she murmured , as she swept out of the room .",2
"i now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture . yes , i was right : it was mr . brocklehurst , buttoned up in a surtout , and looking longer , narrower , and more rigid than ever .",2
the four friends exchanged a joyful glance ; half of the work was done .,6
"he hurried on towards the left , glancing back now and then to see if he was being followed . in about seven or eight minutes he reached a small shabby house that was wedged in between two gaunt factories . in one of the top - windows stood a lamp . he stopped and gave a peculiar knock .",7
"the fact is that our friend , the baronet , begins to display a considerable interest in our fair neighbour . it is not to be wondered at , for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an active man like him , and she is a very fascinating and beautiful woman . there is something tropical and exotic about her which forms a singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother . yet he also gives the idea of hidden fires . he has certainly a very marked influence over her , for i have seen her continually glance at him as she talked as if seeking approbation for what she said . i trust that he is kind to her . there is a dry glitter in his eyes , and a firm set of his thin lips , which goes with a positive and possibly a harsh nature . you would find him an interesting study .",100
"i see genuine contentment in your gait and mien , your eye and face , when you are helping me and pleasing me -- working for me , and with me , in , as you characteristically say , ' _ all that is right _ : ' for if i bid you do what you thought wrong , there would be no light - footed running , no neat - handed alacrity , no lively glance and animated complexion .",76
"here i saw his glance directed to my hands , which were folded on the table before me .",4
"the tall and phlegmatic lord ingram leans with folded arms on the chair - back of the little and lively amy eshton ; she glances up at him , and chatters like a wren : she likes him better than she does mr . rochester .",24
"but neither in the street he had passed through , nor in the one which his eager glance pervaded , could he see anyone ; however slowly the stranger had walked , he was gone on his way , or perhaps had entered some house .",17
"she glanced at them , and then looked up at us with the set , rigid face of a desperate woman .",1
""" and you were ? "" i asked , with a slightly malicious glance at my companion .",13
"i feared -- or should i say , hoped?--the allusion to me would make mr . rochester glance my way ; and i involuntarily shrank farther into the shade : but he never turned his eyes .",17
"his hard eyes darted a piercing glance at the three men , who walked near him , but nothing denoted that he recollected being their fellow , or at least having been so .",6
"our gascon knew , by the first glance of his eye , that his billet had been delivered , and that this billet had had its effect .",7
