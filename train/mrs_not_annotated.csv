"not that i ever suffered much from them ; i took care to turn the tables . what tricks theodore and i used to play on our miss wilsons , and mrs . greys , and madame jouberts ! mary was always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit .",31
""" mrs . reed , my uncle 's wife . my uncle is dead , and he left me to her care . """,1
"mrs . fairfax had said mr . rochester possessed a fine voice : he did -- a mellow , powerful bass , into which he threw his own feeling , his own force ; finding a way through the ear to the heart , and there waking sensation strangely .",0
""" what ? "" said mrs . reed under her breath : her usually cold composed grey eye became troubled with a look like fear ; she took her hand from my arm , and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether i were child or fiend .",5
"mrs . reed soon rallied her spirits : she shook me most soundly , she boxed both my ears , and then left me without a word .",0
"she had a turn for traffic , and a marked propensity for saving ; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens , but also in driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower - roots , seeds , and slips of plants ; that functionary having orders from mrs . reed to buy of his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell : and eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a handsome profit thereby .",51
"i would have asked who wanted me : i would have demanded if mrs . reed was there ; but bessie was already gone , and had closed the nursery - door upon me .",13
"mrs . reed answered for me by an expressive shake of the head , adding soon , "" perhaps the less said on that subject the better , mr . brocklehurst . """,0
""" sorry indeed to hear it ! she and i must have some talk ; "" and bending from the perpendicular , he installed his person in the arm - chair opposite mrs . reed 's .",32
""" it is a formidable difficulty , and i fear that you ask too much when you expect me to solve it . the past and the present are within the field of my inquiry , but what a man may do in the future is a hard question to answer . mrs . stapleton has heard her husband discuss the problem on several occasions . there were three possible courses . he might claim the property from south america , establish his identity before the british authorities there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to england at all ; or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the short time that he need be in london ; or , again , he might furnish an accomplice with the proofs and papers , putting him in as heir , and retaining a claim upon some proportion of his income . we can not doubt from what we know of him that he would have found some way out of the difficulty . and now , my dear watson , we have had some weeks of severe work , and for one evening , i think , we may turn our thoughts into more pleasant channels . i have a box for ' les huguenots . ' have you heard the de reszkes ? might i trouble you then to be ready in half an hour , and we can stop at marcini 's for a little dinner on the way ? """,52
"adele , indeed , no sooner saw mrs . fairfax , than she summoned her to her sofa , and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain , the ivory , the waxen contents of her "" boite ; "" pouring out , meantime , explanations and raptures in such broken english as she was mistress of .",7
""" benefactress ! benefactress ! "" said i inwardly : "" they all call mrs . reed my benefactress ; if so , a benefactress is a disagreeable thing . """,14
""" bless you!--i knew you would come ! "" exclaimed mrs . leaven , as i entered .",10
"how is mrs . reed?--alive still , i hope . """,2
""" deceit is , indeed , a sad fault in a child , "" said mr . brocklehurst ; "" it is akin to falsehood , and all liars will have their portion in the lake burning with fire and brimstone ; she shall , however , be watched , mrs . reed . i will speak to miss temple and the teachers . """,50
""" this is the state of things i quite approve , "" returned mrs . reed ; "" had i sought all england over , i could scarcely have found a system more exactly fitting a child like jane eyre .",13
""" good - bye , mr . brocklehurst ; remember me to mrs . and miss brocklehurst , and to augusta and theodore , and master broughton brocklehurst . """,12
my vacations had all been spent at school : mrs . reed had never sent for me to gateshead ; neither she nor any of her family had ever been to visit me .,9
"mrs . reed and i were left alone : some minutes passed in silence ; she was sewing , i was watching her .",0
"mrs . reed looked up from her work ; her eye settled on mine , her fingers at the same time suspended their nimble movements .",0
"my fingers had fastened on her hand which lay outside the sheet : had she pressed mine kindly , i should at that moment have experienced true pleasure . but unimpressionable natures are not so soon softened , nor are natural antipathies so readily eradicated . mrs . reed took her hand away , and , turning her face rather from me , she remarked that the night was warm .",46
""" here is your ring , mrs . sawyer , "" i interrupted , in obedience to a sign from my companion ; "" it clearly belongs to your daughter , and i am glad to be able to restore it to the rightful owner . """,6
mrs . reed 's hands still lay on her work inactive : her eye of ice continued to dwell freezingly on mine .,0
""" how dare i , mrs . reed ? how dare i ? because it is the _ truth _ .",5
""" a strange wish , mrs . reed ; why do you hate her so ? """,5
"not without cause was this sentiment : mrs . reed looked frightened ; her work had slipped from her knee ; she was lifting up her hands , rocking herself to and fro , and even twisting her face as if she would cry .",7
""" no , mrs . reed . """,3
"the book showed that two names had been added after that of baskerville . one was theophilus johnson and family , of newcastle ; the other mrs . oldmore and maid , of high lodge , alton .",26
"soon after , mrs . reed grew more composed , and sank into a dozing state . i then left her .",3
""" ah , that settles it . mrs . oldmore , too ; i seem to remember the name . excuse my curiosity , but often in calling upon one friend one finds another . """,7
"mrs . fairfax ! i saw her in a black gown and widow 's cap ; frigid , perhaps , but not uncivil : a model of elderly english respectability .",0
"willingly would i now have gone and asked mrs . reed 's pardon ; but i knew , partly from experience and partly from instinct , that was the way to make her repulse me with double scorn , thereby re - exciting every turbulent impulse of my nature .",8
"after a few moments , in her black silk dress , with old - fashioned thread mittens on her wrinkled hands , mrs . leaf bustled into the library . he asked her for the key of the schoolroom .",22
mrs . lyons flushed with anger again .,0
""" you 're not grown so very tall , miss jane , nor so very stout , "" continued mrs . leaven .",19
""" and mrs . reed ? """,2
i knew mrs . reed had not spoken for days : was she reviving ?,2
""" this statement came from mrs . charpentier 's lips with many gasps and pauses . at times she spoke so low that i could hardly catch the words . i made shorthand notes of all that she said , however , so that there should be no possibility of a mistake . """,5
""" when mrs . charpentier paused , "" the detective continued , "" i saw that the whole case hung upon one point . fixing her with my eye in a way which i always found effective with women , i asked her at what hour her son returned .",2
"well , perhaps i have : to speak truth , i have an acquaintance with one of them , mrs . poole-- """,19
""" mrs . lyons ! """,1
""" do n't be alarmed , "" continued the strange being ; "" she 's a safe hand is mrs . poole : close and quiet ; any one may repose confidence in her .",19
"as we passed mrs . reed 's bedroom , she said , "" will you go in and bid missis good- bye ? """,3
""" what a long way ! i wonder mrs . reed is not afraid to trust her so far alone . """,8
"at lowood , indeed , i took that resolution , kept it , and succeeded in pleasing ; but with mrs . reed , i remember my best was always spurned with scorn .",20
""" but we have such grave responsibilities , "" ventured mrs . vandeleur timidly .",10
"during the first twelve hours i thought of mrs . reed in her last moments ; i saw her disfigured and discoloured face , and heard her strangely altered voice . i mused on the funeral day , the coffin , the hearse , the black train of tenants and servants -- few was the number of relatives -- the gaping vault , the silent church , the solemn service .",8
"i thought no more of mrs . fairfax ; i thought no more of grace poole , or the laugh : in an instant , i was within the chamber .",5
"inside , in the servants ' part of the house , the half - clad domestics were talking in low whispers to each other . old mrs . leaf was crying and wringing her hands . francis was as pale as death .",26
""" mrs . fairfax ? no ; what the deuce would you call her for ?",1
""" you must see the carriage , jane , and tell me if you do n't think it will suit mrs . rochester exactly ; and whether she wo n't look like queen boadicea , leaning back against those purple cushions .",20
""" to see mrs . laura lyons ? """,3
""" no , nor drink . and mr . bender , he was the fust to go , and then indian pete , and then mrs . mcgregor , and then johnny hones , and then , dearie , your mother . """,25
""" that 's better , "" said he , seeing the shadow rise from my face . "" and now tell me the result of your visit to mrs . laura lyons -- it was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you had gone , for i am already aware that she is the one person in coombe tracey who might be of service to us in the matter . in fact , if you had not gone to - day it is exceedingly probable that i should have gone to - morrow . """,28
""" can you understand her when she runs on so fast ? "" asked mrs . fairfax .",14
"but the morning passed just as usual : nothing happened to interrupt the quiet course of adele 's studies ; only soon after breakfast , i heard some bustle in the neighbourhood of mr . rochester 's chamber , mrs . fairfax 's voice , and leah 's , and the cook's -- that is , john 's wife -- and even john 's own gruff tones .",39
""" if this woman is in truth his wife , where does mrs . laura lyons come in ? "" i asked .",12
"mrs . fairfax 's room and yours are the nearest to master 's ; but mrs . fairfax said she heard nothing : when people get elderly , they often sleep heavy . """,15
""" mrs . poole , "" said she , addressing grace , "" the servants ' dinner will soon be ready : will you come down ? """,1
"mrs . fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar , which stood on a sideboard .",0
"the thought of mrs . o'gall and bitternutt lodge struck cold to my heart ; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam , destined , as it seemed , to rush between me and the master at whose side i now walked , and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean -- wealth , caste , custom intervened between me and what i naturally and inevitably loved .",3
"but , having reached this point of conjecture , mrs . poole 's square , flat figure , and uncomely , dry , even coarse face , recurred so distinctly to my mind 's eye , that i thought , "" no ; impossible ! my supposition can not be correct .",9
"briggs , wood , mason , i invite you all to come up to the house and visit mrs . poole 's patient , and _ my wife _ ! you shall see what sort of a being i was cheated into espousing , and judge whether or not i had a right to break the compact , and seek sympathy with something at least human .",18
""" good - morrow , mrs . poole ! "" said mr . rochester . "" how are you ? and how is your charge to - day ? """,5
this was all the account i got from mrs . fairfax of her employer and mine .,8
"there were moments when i was bewildered by the terror he inspired , because i had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his inflictions ; the servants did not like to offend their young master by taking my part against him , and mrs . reed was blind and deaf on the subject : she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me , though he did both now and then in her very presence , more frequently , however , behind her back .",45
"mrs . poole advanced . "" keep out of the way , "" said mr . rochester , thrusting her aside : "" she has no knife now , i suppose , and i 'm on my guard . """,0
""" none that i ever heard of , "" returned mrs . fairfax , smiling .",10
""" where are you going now , mrs . fairfax ? "" for she was moving away .",7
""" well , he was up in the loft at the time , so that i could not put it into his own hands , but i gave it into mrs . barrymore 's hands , and she promised to deliver it at once . """,30
"mrs . fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap - door ; i , by drift of groping , found the outlet from the attic , and proceeded to descend the narrow garret staircase .",0
"aid was near him : eliza and georgiana had run for mrs . reed , who was gone upstairs : she now came upon the scene , followed by bessie and her maid abbot .",11
""" afterwards , take a piece of smooth ivory -- you have one prepared in your drawing - box : take your palette , mix your freshest , finest , clearest tints ; choose your most delicate camel - hair pencils ; delineate carefully the loveliest face you can imagine ; paint it in your softest shades and sweetest lines , according to the description given by mrs . fairfax of blanche ingram ; remember the raven ringlets , the oriental eye;--what ! you revert to mr . rochester as a model ! order !",67
"mrs . vane glanced at her , and with one of those false theatrical gestures that so often become a mode of second nature to a stage - player , clasped her in her arms . at this moment , the door opened and a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room . he was thick - set of figure , and his hands and feet were large and somewhat clumsy in movement . he was not so finely bred as his sister . one would hardly have guessed the close relationship that existed between them . mrs . vane fixed her eyes on him and intensified her smile . she mentally elevated her son to the dignity of an audience . she felt sure that the tableau was interesting .",0

""" my son , do n't say such dreadful things , "" murmured mrs . vane , taking up a tawdry theatrical dress , with a sigh , and beginning to patch it . she felt a little disappointed that he had not joined the group . it would have increased the theatrical picturesqueness of the situation .",13
"mr . rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight , when the post brought mrs . fairfax a letter . "" it is from the master , "" said she , as she looked at the direction . "" now i suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not . """,15

""" my child ! my child ! "" cried mrs . vane , looking up to the ceiling in search of an imaginary gallery .",9
""" miss ingram ! "" exclaimed mrs . fairfax , and away she hurried to her post below .",6
""" then i should love mrs . reed , which i can not do ; i should bless her son john , which is impossible . """,5
""" well , "" i asked impatiently , "" is not mrs . reed a hard - hearted , bad woman ? """,11

"turning from bessie ( though her presence was far less obnoxious to me than that of abbot , for instance , would have been ) , i scrutinised the face of the gentleman : i knew him ; it was mr . lloyd , an apothecary , sometimes called in by mrs . reed when the servants were ailing : for herself and the children she employed a physician .",51
""" you will see her this evening , "" answered mrs . fairfax .",10
"shall you be there , mrs . fairfax ? """,5
"i had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition ; too well i remembered the perfidious hints given by mrs . reed about my disposition , & c. ; the promise pledged by mr . brocklehurst to apprise miss temple and the teachers of my vicious nature .",21
"was it suspected that this lunatic , mrs . rochester , had any hand in it ? """,7
"she had a woman to take care of her called mrs . poole -- an able woman in her line , and very trustworthy , but for one fault -- a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons -- she _ kept a private bottle of gin by her _ , and now and then took a drop over - much .",10
"j'ai dit qu'oui : car c'est vrai , n'est - ce pas , mademoiselle ? "" i and my pupil dined as usual in mrs . fairfax 's parlour ; the afternoon was wild and snowy , and we passed it in the schoolroom .",24
"as far as person went , she answered point for point , both to my picture and mrs . fairfax 's description . the noble bust , the sloping shoulders , the graceful neck , the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;--but her face ?",17
"these ladies were deferentially received by miss temple , as mrs . and the misses brocklehurst , and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the room .",10
""" here is miss eyre , sir , "" said mrs . fairfax , in her quiet way .",10
"as he came down the great staircase at last , after mrs . rochester had flung herself from the battlements , there was a great crash -- all fell .",11
