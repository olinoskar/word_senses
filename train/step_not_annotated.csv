"one instant after , the heavy step of a marine who served as sentinel was heard in the corridor -- his ax in his girdle and his musket on his shoulder .",6
"traversing the long and matted gallery , i descended the slippery steps of oak ; then i gained the hall : i halted there a minute ; i looked at some pictures on the walls ( one , i remember , represented a grim man in a cuirass , and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace ) , at a bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling , at a great clock whose case was of oak curiously carved , and ebon black with time and rubbing .",11
"the hall - door , which was half of glass , stood open ; i stepped over the threshold .",15
"however , the revolution which appeared upon his countenance was so visible that bonacieux was terrified at it , and he endeavored to draw back a step or two ; but as he was standing before the half of the door which was shut , the obstacle compelled him to keep his place .",26

"the moon was set , and it was very dark ; bessie carried a lantern , whose light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw . raw and chill was the winter morning : my teeth chattered as i hastened down the drive .",21
""" i hear a horse ’s steps ; it is my brother setting off again . i should like to offer him a last salute . come ! """,6
"i stayed my step , almost my breath , and stood to watch him -- to examine him , myself unseen , and alas ! to him invisible .",3
"i had no difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation , my step from hasty advance .",12
"worn out , indeed , i was ; not another step could i stir . i sank on the wet doorstep : i groaned -- i wrung my hands -- i wept in utter anguish .",10
"by day they did nothing but ascend and descend the steps which led to the chapel ; at night , in addition to complines and matins , they were further obliged to leap twenty times out of their beds and prostrate themselves on the floor of their cells .",10

athos did not leave his chamber ; he made up his mind not to take a single step to equip himself .,17
"athos availed himself of the permission , ascended the stairs with his lightest step , gained the landing , and through the open door perceived milady putting on her hat .",13
"i reached the lodge at gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of the first of may : i stepped in there before going up to the hall . it was very clean and neat : the ornamental windows were hung with little white curtains ; the floor was spotless ; the grate and fire - irons were burnished bright , and the fire burnt clear . bessie sat on the hearth , nursing her last - born , and robert and his sister played quietly in a corner .",19
"anne of austria took one step backward , became so pale that it might be said she was dying , and leaning with her left hand upon a table behind her to keep herself from falling , she with her right hand drew the paper from her bosom and held it out to the keeper of the seals .",5
"but this mystery would inevitably be cleared up , and soon , because captain nemo gave orders to increase speed ; at once the engine stepped up its drive power , setting the propeller in swifter rotation .",25

"hardly , however , had he taken ten steps before he returned .",8
"many citizens , seeing the women flying toward the high street , leaving their children crying at the open doors , hastened to don the cuirass , and supporting their somewhat uncertain courage with a musket or a partisan , directed their steps toward the hostelry of the jolly miller , before which was gathered , increasing every minute , a compact group , vociferous and full of curiosity .",42
"athos dwelt in the rue ferou , within two steps of the luxembourg . his apartment consisted of two small chambers , very nicely fitted up , in a furnished house , the hostess of which , still young and still really handsome , cast tender glances uselessly at him .",9
"when she was only about three steps from him , he turned his head round , fixing his eyes steadfastly upon the lady with the red cushion , who had risen and was approaching , followed by her black boy and her woman .",6
"the bolts were drawn ; the door groaned upon its hinges . steps sounded in the chamber , and drew near .",12
"he walked six or seven times round the place royale , turning at every ten steps to look at the light in milady ’s apartment , which was to be seen through the blinds . it was evident that this time the young woman was not in such haste to retire to her apartment as she had been the first .",15
in one of those halts he heard the steps of several horses on the road .,8
"i crept forward through the nautilus 's dark gangways , pausing after each step to curb the pounding of my heart . i arrived at the corner door of the lounge . i opened it gently . the lounge was plunged in profound darkness . chords from the organ were reverberating faintly . captain nemo was there . he did n't see me . even in broad daylight i doubt that he would have noticed me , so completely was he immersed in his trance .",13
"but at that moment , top barked angrily , and neb , who was looking for the first steps , uttered a cry . there was no longer a ladder !",18
"felton made a slight bow , and directed his steps toward the door .",9
"unfortunately , as he advanced , his anger increased at every step ; and instead of the proper and lofty speech he had prepared as a prelude to his challenge , he found nothing at the tip of his tongue but a gross personality , which he accompanied with a furious gesture .",11
"the stranger looked at him again with a slight smile , and retiring from the window , came out of the hostelry with a slow step , and placed himself before the horse , within two paces of d’artagnan .",25
""" in that case , my brave lieutenant , let us leave milady to find out something else , and go to supper ; but be easy ! she has a fruitful imagination , and the second act of the comedy will not delay its steps after the first . """,45
"these steps drew near to his dungeon , the door was thrown open , and the guards appeared .",1
"d’artagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek a ridiculous death in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat a single step . besides , courage was out of the question here ; d’artagnan had fallen into an ambush .",29
""" not before i have killed you , poltroon ! "" cried d’artagnan , making the best face possible , and never retreating one step before his three assailants , who continued to shower blows upon him .",24
"but this time milady lent a more attentive ear than the first , and she heard their steps die away in the distance of the corridor .",17
"hannah soon had a lantern lit . the vehicle had stopped at the wicket ; the driver opened the door : first one well - known form , then another , stepped out .",31
"he was masked likewise ; but i knew his step , i knew his voice , i knew him by that imposing bearing which hell has bestowed upon his person for the curse of humanity .",9
"this something was enveloped in a cloak , and d’artagnan at first believed it was a man ; but by the smallness of the form , the hesitation of the walk , and the indecision of the step , he soon discovered that it was a woman .",37
"but as the bushes shrank , the tree forms magnified . actual petrified thickets and long alcoves from some fantastic school of architecture kept opening up before our steps . captain nemo entered beneath a dark gallery whose gentle slope took us to a depth of 100 meters . the light from our glass coils produced magical effects at times , lingering on the wrinkled roughness of some natural arch , or some overhang suspended like a chandelier , which our lamps flecked with fiery sparks . amid these shrubs of precious coral , i observed other polyps no less unusual : melita coral , rainbow coral with jointed outgrowths , then a few tufts of genus corallina , some green and others red , actually a type of seaweed encrusted with limestone salts , which , after long disputes , naturalists have finally placed in the vegetable kingdom . but as one intellectual has remarked , "" here , perhaps , is the actual point where life rises humbly out of slumbering stone , but without breaking away from its crude starting point .

"at a signal from captain nemo , one of his men stepped forward and , a few feet from this cross , detached a mattock from his belt and began to dig a hole .",11

"arrived at this point the settlers retraced their steps , and at nightfall entered the chimneys ; but they did not sleep before the question of knowing whether they could think of leaving lincoln island or not was definitely settled .",8
"crossing through the lounge , i arrived at the door , contrived in one of the canted corners , that opened into the captain 's stateroom . much to my astonishment , this door was ajar . i instinctively recoiled . if captain nemo was in his stateroom , he might see me . but , not hearing any sounds , i approached . the stateroom was deserted . i pushed the door open . i took a few steps inside . still the same austere , monastic appearance .",79
"ayrton then , followed by pencroft , crossed it with a rapid step , scaring the birds nestled in the holes of the rocks ; then , without hesitating , he plunged into the sea , and swam noiselessly in the direction of the ship , in which a few lights had recently appeared , showing her exact situation .",12
"i passed a tall briar , shooting leafy and flowery branches across the path ; i see the narrow stile with stone steps ; and i see -- mr . rochester sitting there , a book and a pencil in his hand ; he is writing .",22
"the ruhmkorff lamp hanging from my belt , my rifle in hand , i was ready to go forth . but in all honesty , while imprisoned in these heavy clothes and nailed to the deck by my lead soles , it was impossible for me to take a single step .",50
"when diana and mary returned , the former found her scholar transferred from her to her brother : she laughed , and both she and mary agreed that st . john should never have persuaded them to such a step .",39
"we had been gone from the nautilus for about an hour and a half . it was almost noon . i spotted this fact in the perpendicularity of the sun 's rays , which were no longer refracted . the magic of these solar colors disappeared little by little , with emerald and sapphire shades vanishing from our surroundings altogether . we walked with steady steps that rang on the seafloor with astonishing intensity . the tiniest sounds were transmitted with a speed to which the ear is unaccustomed on shore . in fact , water is a better conductor of sound than air , and under the waves noises carry four times as fast .",65
"at each step , as it were , that the explorers made , fresh stars entered the field of their vision .",2
"besides , the appearance of the caravan was formidable . the black horses of the musketeers , their martial carriage , with the regimental step of these noble companions of the soldier , would have betrayed the most strict incognito .",24
"he could not then hasten to england himself , to extricate you from the snare into which you had fallen , but he implored mr . mason to lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage .",33
"and the stranger , muttering to himself , directed his steps toward the kitchen .",10
""" it 's like your impudence to say so : i expected it of you ; i heard it in your step as you crossed the threshold . """,21
"soon as kitty left him , d’artagnan directed his steps toward the rue ferou .",9
"but they had not made fifty steps in this direction , when they heard the dog barking furiously .",6
"i see trees laden with ripening fruit . i hear a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off ; no moving form is visible , no coming step audible ; but that perfume increases : i must flee .",29
"i make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery , and i see mr . rochester entering . i step aside into the ivy recess ; he will not stay long : he will soon return whence he came , and if i sit still he will never see me .",19
"athos rose , walked toward his friend with a slow and solemn step , embraced him tenderly , and as he burst into violent sobs , he said to him with his noble and persuasive voice , "" friend , be a man !",12
"i started moving , groping my way . after five steps i encountered an iron wall made of riveted boilerplate . then , turning around , i bumped into a wooden table next to which several stools had been set . the floor of this prison lay hidden beneath thick , hempen matting that deadened the sound of footsteps . its naked walls did n't reveal any trace of a door or window . going around the opposite way , conseil met up with me , and we returned to the middle of this cabin , which had to be twenty feet long by ten wide . as for its height , not even ned land , with his great stature , was able to determine it .",10
"scarcely had he gone ten steps when his ears began to tingle , a faintness seized him , a cloud of blood passed over his eyes , and he fell in the middle of the street , crying still , "" coward ! coward ! coward ! """,5
"milady knew she might be watched , so she continued her prayers to the end ; and it appeared to her that the soldier who was on duty at her door did not march with the same step , and seemed to listen .",37
"steps came running along the outer passage ; the key turned , bessie and abbot entered .",0
"he ran forward , then returned , and seemed to entreat them to hasten their steps .",15
"the note burned the hand of d’artagnan . he wished to hasten their steps ; but athos took his arm and passed it under his own , and the young man was forced to regulate his pace by that of his friend .",13
"felton had fallen ; but there was still another step to be taken . he must be retained , or rather he must be left quite alone ; and milady but obscurely perceived the means which could lead to this result .",9
"at a hundred paces from the gates of calais , d’artagnan ’s horse gave out , and could not by any means be made to get up again , the blood flowing from his eyes and his nose . there still remained planchet ’s horse ; but he stopped short , and could not be made to move a step .",59
"at the third knock , however , steps were heard inside . the door at length was opened , and a man appeared , of high stature , pale complexion , and black hair and beard .",7
"anxiety hastened his steps , for he longed to obtain news of his friend , and he soon disappeared round an angle of the cliff .",3
"faithful to his mission of vengeance , athos had requested to be conducted to the garden ; and there upon the sand following the light steps of this woman , who left sharp tracks wherever she went , he advanced toward the gate which led into the wood , and causing it to be opened , he went out into the forest .",25
""" there , then--'off , ye lendings ! ' "" and mr . rochester stepped out of his disguise .",14
"arrived at the staircase , it was still worse . there were four musketeers on the bottom steps , amusing themselves with the following exercise , while ten or twelve of their comrades waited upon the landing place to take their turn in the sport .",17
he who at the moment occupied the upper step kept his adversaries marvelously in check .,8
""" admirable and dogmatic ! "" repeated the curate , who , about as strong as d’artagnan with respect to latin , carefully watched the jesuit in order to keep step with him , and repeated his words like an echo .",30
"felton recognized it also , and made a step toward the door .",8
"neb , herbert , and pencroft left the cave and directed their steps towards a high mound crowned with a few distorted trees .",12

"the baron , finding himself disarmed , took two or three steps back , but in this movement his foot slipped and he fell backward .",11
"at the captain 's signal we returned to the bank of shellfish , and retracing our steps , we walked for half an hour until we encountered the anchor connecting the seafloor with the nautilus 's skiff .",16
"the reporter and the engineer went together , gideon spilett ready to note every incident , the engineer silent for the most part , and only stepping aside to pick up one thing or another , a mineral or vegetable substance , which he put into his pocket , without making any remark .",26

"near the bottom of the ladder , when he found no more support for his feet , he clung with his hands ; at length , arrived at the last step , he let himself hang by the strength of his wrists , and touched the ground .",30
"m de treville was at the moment in rather ill - humor , nevertheless he saluted the young man politely , who bowed to the very ground ; and he smiled on receiving d’artagnan ’s response , the bearnese accent of which recalled to him at the same time his youth and his country -- a double remembrance which makes a man smile at all ages ; but stepping toward the antechamber and making a sign to d’artagnan with his hand , as if to ask his permission to finish with others before he began with him , he called three times , with a louder voice at each time , so that he ran through the intervening tones between the imperative accent and the angry accent .",68
"about five o'clock in the evening cyrus harding and his companions retraced their steps to their dwelling by traversing tadorn 's fens , and crossed the mercy on the ice - bridge .",13
"he chose a straight young fir , with no knots , and which he had only to square at the step , and round off at the top .",20
"soon after she heard lighter steps than those of the sentinel , which came from the end of the corridor and stopped before her door .",5
"i experienced a strange feeling as the key grated in the lock , and the sound of his retreating step ceased to be heard .",19
"i must have walked like a somnambulist , without any knowledge of my steps , and top must have guided me here , after having dragged me from the waves ...",13
"however , a few instants after she had finished her religious song , milady thought she heard a profound sigh . then the same steps she had heard approach slowly withdrew , as if with regret .",24

"i was hateful in my own eyes . still i could not turn , nor retrace one step .",17
"and certainly , pedestrians , hindered at each step by bushes , caught by creepers , barred by trunks of trees , did not shine beside those supple animals , who , bounding from branch to branch , were hindered by nothing on their course .",8
"after approaching milady with a slow and solemn step , so that the table alone separated them , the unknown took off his mask .",8
"d’artagnan placed his naked sword under his arm , allowed the duke and mme . bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead , and then followed them , ready to execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of charles i.",19

"by then the nautilus had returned to the surface of the waves . stationed on the top steps , one of the seamen undid the bolts of the hatch . but he had scarcely unscrewed the nuts when the hatch flew up with tremendous violence , obviously pulled open by the suckers on a devilfish 's arm .",17
"he recalled , all at once , the warnings of lord de winter , the seductions of milady , her first attempts after her arrival . he drew back a step , and hung down his head , without , however , ceasing to look at her , as if , fascinated by this strange creature , he could not detach his eyes from her eyes .",30
"and at these words , the musketeer , in irreproachable costume , belted as usual , with a tolerably firm step , entered the cabinet .",20
""" do i look so ? "" asked the baron , rising and going a step backward .",15

"it would have taken the settlers four hours to do this , on a clear ground and without hurrying themselves ; but as it was they needed double the time , for what with trees to go round , bushes to cut down , and creepers to chop away , they were impeded at every step , these obstacles greatly lengthening their journey .",55
"before returning to the cave , the sailor and herbert , in the event of fire being positively unattainable , collected some more shell - fish , and then silently retraced their steps to their dwelling .",32
"this done , he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in the wall bordering the orchard . i , supposing he had done with me , prepared to return to the house ; again , however , i heard him call "" jane ! """,7
"upon their surface fell other waves , which in their turn became stone , but a step nearer the center of the lake .",16
"there followed between these two personages a strange silence , during which the sound of a slow and regular step was heard approaching . shortly a human form appeared in the shade of the corridor , and the young lieutenant , with whom we are already acquainted , stopped at the threshold to receive the orders of the baron .",19
