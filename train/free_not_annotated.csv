"an apt remark . for who could predict the minimum time we would need to free ourselves ? before the nautilus could return to the surface of the waves , could n't we all die of asphyxiation ? were this ship and everyone on board doomed to perish in this tomb of ice ? it was a dreadful state of affairs . but we faced it head - on , each one of us determined to do his duty to the end .",15

"the next day , march 26 , i returned to my miner 's trade , working to remove the fifth meter . the ice bank 's side walls and underbelly had visibly thickened . obviously they would come together before the nautilus could break free . for an instant i was gripped by despair . my pick nearly slipped from my hands . what was the point of this digging if i was to die smothered and crushed by this water turning to stone , a torture undreamed of by even the wildest savages ! i felt like i was lying in the jaws of a fearsome monster , jaws irresistibly closing .",44

"so ned land had good reason to worry . in these wide seas empty of islands , it was no longer feasible to jump ship . nor did we have any way to counter captain nemo 's whims . we had no choice but to acquiesce ; but if we could n't attain our end through force or cunning , i liked to think we might achieve it through persuasion . once this voyage was over , might not captain nemo consent to set us free in return for our promise never to reveal his existence ? our word of honor , which we sincerely would have kept . however , this delicate question would have to be negotiated with the captain . but how would he receive our demands for freedom ? at the very outset and in no uncertain terms , had n't he declared that the secret of his life required that we be permanently imprisoned on board the nautilus ? would n't he see my four - month silence as a tacit acceptance of this situation ? would my returning to this subject arouse suspicions that could jeopardize our escape plans , if we had promising circumstances for trying again later on ? i weighed all these considerations , turned them over in my mind , submitted them to conseil , but he was as baffled as i was . in short , although i 'm not easily discouraged , i realized that my chances of ever seeing my fellow men again were shrinking by the day , especially at a time when captain nemo was recklessly racing toward the south atlantic !",85

"the whole thing occurred in a moment — so quickly that i had no time to realize it . i have a vivid recollection of that instant , of holmes ' triumphant expression and the ring of his voice , of the cabman 's dazed , savage face , as he glared at the glittering handcuffs , which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists . for a second or two we might have been a group of statues . then , with an inarticulate roar of fury , the prisoner wrenched himself free from holmes 's grasp , and hurled himself through the window . woodwork and glass gave way before him ; but before he got quite through , gregson , lestrade , and holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds . he was dragged back into the room , and then commenced a terrific conflict . so powerful and so fierce was he , that the four of us were shaken off again and again . he appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit . his face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass , but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance . it was not until lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and half - strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail ; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his hands . that done , we rose to our feet breathless and panting .",95
