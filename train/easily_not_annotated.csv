"the day on which d’artagnan presented himself the assemblage was imposing , particularly for a provincial just arriving from his province . it is true that this provincial was a gascon ; and that , particularly at this period , the compatriots of d’artagnan had the reputation of not being easily intimidated .",50
"yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable . a cadaverousness of complexion ; an eye large , liquid , and luminous beyond comparison ; lips somewhat thin and very pallid , but of a surpassingly beautiful curve ; a nose of a delicate hebrew model , but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations ; a finely moulded chin , speaking , in its want of prominence , of a want of moral energy ; hair of a more than web - like softness and tenuity;—these features , with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple , made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten .",112
