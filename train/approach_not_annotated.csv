"most of these seals were sleeping on the rocks or the sand . among those properly termed seals -- which have no external ears , unlike sea lions whose ears protrude -- i observed several varieties of the species stenorhynchus , three meters long , with white hair , bulldog heads , and armed with ten teeth in each jaw : four incisors in both the upper and lower , plus two big canines shaped like the fleur - de - lis . among them slithered some sea elephants , a type of seal with a short , flexible trunk ; these are the giants of the species , with a circumference of twenty feet and a length of ten meters . they did n't move as we approached .",128

"after clearing the outer belt of rocks via a narrow passageway , the nautilus lay inside the breakers where the sea had a depth of thirty to forty fathoms . under the green shade of some tropical evergreens , i spotted a few savages who looked extremely startled at our approach . in this long , blackish object advancing flush with the water , did n't they see some fearsome cetacean that they were obliged to view with distrust ?",50

"towards two o'clock in the afternoon , while it was snowing hard , long whistles were heard approaching from the east . a great shadow , preceded by a wild light , slowly advanced , appearing still larger through the mist , which gave it a fantastic aspect . no train was expected from the east , neither had there been time for the succour asked for by telegraph to arrive ; the train from omaha to san francisco was not due till the next day . the mystery was soon explained .",17

"breathing that sea breeze , so much more invigorating and balsamic as the land is approached , contemplating all the power of those preparations she was commissioned to destroy , all the power of that army which she was to combat alone -- she , a woman with a few bags of gold -- milady compared herself mentally to judith , the terrible jewess , when she penetrated the camp of the assyrians and beheld the enormous mass of chariots , horses , men , and arms , which a gesture of her hand was to dissipate like a cloud of smoke .",15
"they entered the roadstead ; but as they drew near in order to cast anchor , a little cutter , looking like a coastguard formidably armed , approached the merchant vessel and dropped into the sea a boat which directed its course to the ladder .",27
"crossing through the lounge , i arrived at the door , contrived in one of the canted corners , that opened into the captain 's stateroom . much to my astonishment , this door was ajar . i instinctively recoiled . if captain nemo was in his stateroom , he might see me . but , not hearing any sounds , i approached . the stateroom was deserted . i pushed the door open . i took a few steps inside . still the same austere , monastic appearance .",62
we were now approaching thornfield .,3
"at seven o'clock the log told me that the nautilus had reduced speed . i realized that it was letting the warship approach . moreover , the explosions grew more intensely audible . shells furrowed the water around us , drilling through it with an odd hissing sound .",22

diana and mary rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached for leaving their brother and their home .,12
"and yet , at the very door the musketeer began to entertain some doubts . the approach was not such as to prepossess people -- an ill - smelling , dark passage , a staircase half - lighted by bars through which stole a glimmer from a neighboring yard ; on the first floor a low door studded with enormous nails , like the principal gate of the grand chatelet .",16
"but there was no time to lose . if my companions moved but a few steps away , the acoustic phenomenon would cease . i therefore approached the wall , and pronounced these words as clearly as possible :",26

"suddenly a slight movement could be felt over the hull . obviously the nautilus was straightening a bit . objects hanging in the lounge were visibly returning to their normal positions . the walls were approaching the vertical . nobody said a word . hearts pounding , we could see and feel the ship righting itself . the floor was becoming horizontal beneath our feet . ten minutes went by .",35
"now , one evening when d’artagnan , who was in the trenches , was not able to accompany them , athos , porthos , and aramis , mounted on their battle steeds , enveloped in their war cloaks , with their hands upon their pistol butts , were returning from a drinking place called the red dovecot , which athos had discovered two days before upon the route to jarrie , following the road which led to the camp and quite on their guard , as we have stated , for fear of an ambuscade , when , about a quarter of a league from the village of boisnau , they fancied they heard the sound of horses approaching them . they immediately all three halted , closed in , and waited , occupying the middle of the road . in an instant , and as the moon broke from behind a cloud , they saw at a turning of the road two horsemen who , on perceiving them , stopped in their turn , appearing to deliberate whether they should continue their route or go back .",118

"meanwhile the reddish light guiding us had expanded and inflamed the horizon . the presence of this furnace under the waters had me extremely puzzled . was it some sort of electrical discharge ? was i approaching some natural phenomenon still unknown to scientists on shore ? or , rather ( and this thought did cross my mind ) , had the hand of man intervened in that blaze ? had human beings fanned those flames ? in these deep strata would i meet up with more of captain nemo 's companions , friends he was about to visit who led lives as strange as his own ? would i find a whole colony of exiles down here , men tired of the world 's woes , men who had sought and found independence in the ocean 's lower depths ? all these insane , inadmissible ideas dogged me , and in this frame of mind , continually excited by the series of wonders passing before my eyes , i would n't have been surprised to find on this sea bottom one of those underwater towns captain nemo dreamed about !",36

"on the 13th they passed the edge of the banks of newfoundland , a dangerous locality ; during the winter , especially , there are frequent fogs and heavy gales of wind . ever since the evening before the barometer , suddenly falling , had indicated an approaching change in the atmosphere ; and during the night the temperature varied , the cold became sharper , and the wind veered to the south - east .",47
"dorian heaved a sigh of relief as he saw the gardener approaching . the man touched his hat , glanced for a moment at lord henry in a hesitating manner , and then produced a letter , which he handed to his master . "" her grace told me to wait for an answer , "" he murmured .",11
"the first signs of the approach of day doubtless determined the retreat of their assailants , who scampered away towards the north , passing over the bridge , which neb ran immediately to raise .",5
athos made a sign for his lackey to approach .,8
"i approached this phenomenal mollusk . its mass of filaments attached it to a table of granite , and there it grew by itself in the midst of the cave 's calm waters . i estimated the weight of this giant clam at 300 kilograms . hence such an oyster held fifteen kilos of meat , and you 'd need the stomach of king gargantua to eat a couple dozen .",1

"ned land went westward up the coast ; then , fording some stream beds , he reached open plains that were bordered by wonderful forests . some kingfishers lurked along the watercourses , but they did n't let us approach . their cautious behavior proved to me that these winged creatures knew where they stood on bipeds of our species , and i concluded that if this island was n't inhabited , at least human beings paid it frequent visits .",39
"the moment the little troop passed goskal and were approaching the port , a man sheltered beneath a tree detached himself from the trunk with which he had been confounded in the darkness , and advanced into the middle of the road , putting his finger on his lips .",9

"it was good advice and we took it . after an hour 's walk we reached a genuine sago palm forest . a few harmless snakes fled underfoot . birds of paradise stole off at our approach , and i was in real despair of catching one when conseil , walking in the lead , stooped suddenly , gave a triumphant shout , and came back to me , carrying a magnificent bird of paradise .",36
"towards morning the ascending movement became accelerated . if the heat increased , instead of diminishing , as we approached nearer to the surface of the globe , this effect was due to local causes alone , and those volcanic . the manner of our locomotion left no doubt in my mind . an enormous force , a force of hundreds of atmospheres , generated by the extreme pressure of confined vapours , was driving us irresistibly forward . but to what numberless dangers it exposed us !",19
"it wanted but a few minutes of six , and shortly after that hour had struck , the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach ; i went to the door and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom .",36
"he admitted , however , although with hesitation , that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable origin — to the severe and long - continued illness — indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution — of a tenderly beloved sister , his sole companion for long years , his last and only relative on earth .",45
"i approached my cheek to her lips : she would not touch it . she said i oppressed her by leaning over the bed , and again demanded water . as i laid her down -- for i raised her and supported her on my arm while she drank -- i covered her ice - cold and clammy hand with mine : the feeble fingers shrank from my touch -- the glazing eyes shunned my gaze .",1

"a great crowd was collected in pall mall and the neighbouring streets on saturday evening ; it seemed like a multitude of brokers permanently established around the reform club . circulation was impeded , and everywhere disputes , discussions , and financial transactions were going on . the police had great difficulty in keeping back the crowd , and as the hour when phileas fogg was due approached , the excitement rose to its highest pitch .",67
"the newly introduced personage followed bonacieux impatiently with his eyes till he had gone out ; and the moment the door closed , "" they have seen each other ; "" said he , approaching the cardinal eagerly .",34

"as i approached the hut , walking as warily as stapleton would do when with poised net he drew near the settled butterfly , i satisfied myself that the place had indeed been used as a habitation . a vague pathway among the boulders led to the dilapidated opening which served as a door . all was silent within . the unknown might be lurking there , or he might be prowling on the moor . my nerves tingled with the sense of adventure . throwing aside my cigarette , i closed my hand upon the butt of my revolver and , walking swiftly up to the door , i looked in . the place was empty .",2

"after standing off the shore the "" bonadventure "" again approached it in the direction of port balloon .",10
"the nautilus passed over these lush , luxuriant depths with tremendous speed . near evening it approached the falkland islands , whose rugged summits i recognized the next day . the sea was of moderate depth . so not without good reason , i assumed that these two islands , plus the many islets surrounding them , used to be part of the magellan coastline . the falkland islands were probably discovered by the famous navigator john davis , who gave them the name davis southern islands . later sir richard hawkins called them the maidenland , after the blessed virgin . subsequently , at the beginning of the 18th century , they were named the malouines by fishermen from saint - malo in brittany , then finally dubbed the falklands by the english , to whom they belong today .",16
"and then at last i heard him . far away came the sharp clink of a boot striking upon a stone . then another and yet another , coming nearer and nearer . i shrank back into the darkest corner , and cocked the pistol in my pocket , determined not to discover myself until i had an opportunity of seeing something of the stranger . there was a long pause which showed that he had stopped . then once more the footsteps approached and a shadow fell across the opening of the hut .",83
"after approaching milady with a slow and solemn step , so that the table alone separated them , the unknown took off his mask .",1
"making a sign to la houdiniere and cahusac to stop , he alighted from his horse , and went toward these suspected merry companions , hoping , by means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge which concealed his approach , to catch some words of this conversation which appeared so interesting . at ten paces from the hedge he recognized the talkative gascon ; and as he had already perceived that these men were musketeers , he did not doubt that the three others were those called the inseparables ; that is to say , athos , porthos , and aramis .",46
"in the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the sierra blanco . as far as the eye can reach stretches the great flat plain - land , all dusted over with patches of alkali , and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes . on the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks , with their rugged summits flecked with snow . in this great stretch of country there is no sign of life , nor of anything appertaining to life . there is no bird in the steel - blue heaven , no movement upon the dull , grey earth — above all , there is absolute silence . listen as one may , there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness ; nothing but silence — complete and heart - subduing silence . it has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain . that is hardly true . looking down from the sierra blanco , one sees a pathway traced out across the desert , which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance . it is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers . here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun , and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali . approach , and examine them ! they are bones : some large and coarse , others smaller and more delicate . the former have belonged to oxen , and the latter to men . for fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside .",242
