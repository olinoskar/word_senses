"mr . phileas fogg lived , in 1872 , at no . 7 , saville row , burlington gardens , the house in which sheridan died in 1814 . he was one of the most noticeable members of the reform club , though he seemed always to avoid attracting attention ; an enigmatical personage , about whom little was known , except that he was a polished man of the world . people said that he resembled byron -- at least that his head was byronic ; but he was a bearded , tranquil byron , who might live on a thousand years without growing old .",57
"was phileas fogg rich ? undoubtedly . but those who knew him best could not imagine how he had made his fortune , and mr . fogg was the last person to whom to apply for the information . he was not lavish , nor , on the contrary , avaricious ; for , whenever he knew that money was needed for a noble , useful , or benevolent purpose , he supplied it quietly and sometimes anonymously . he was , in short , the least communicative of men . he talked very little , and seemed all the more mysterious for his taciturn manner . his daily habits were quite open to observation ; but whatever he did was so exactly the same thing that he had always done before , that the wits of the curious were fairly puzzled .",94
