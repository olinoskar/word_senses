"extending over an expanse of 100 leagues north to south , and over 90 leagues east to west , this island group lies between latitude 2 degrees and 6 degrees south , and between longitude 174 degrees and 179 degrees west . it consists of a number of islands , islets , and reefs , among which we noted the islands of viti levu , vanua levu , and kadavu .",40
"by december 15 we had left the alluring society islands in the west , likewise elegant tahiti , queen of the pacific . in the morning i spotted this island 's lofty summits a few miles to leeward . its waters supplied excellent fish for the tables on board : mackerel , bonito , albacore , and a few varieties of that sea serpent named the moray eel .",12

"with the chart under my eyes , i looked for the gulf of mannar . i found it by the 9th parallel off the northwestern shores of ceylon . it was formed by the long curve of little mannar island . to reach it we had to go all the way up ceylon 's west coast .",54
"the weather was bad during the latter days of the voyage . the wind , obstinately remaining in the north - west , blew a gale , and retarded the steamer . the rangoon rolled heavily and the passengers became impatient of the long , monstrous waves which the wind raised before their path .",21
"but it was to be supposed that this direction changed beyond that point , and that the mercy continued to the north - west , towards the spurs of mount franklin , among which the river rose .",23
"meanwhile , fearing that dumont d'urville was n't abreast of dillon 's activities , the french government sent a sloop of war to vanikoro , the bayonnaise under commander legoarant de tromelin , who had been stationed on the american west coast . dropping anchor before vanikoro a few months after the new astrolabe 's departure , the bayonnaise did n't find any additional evidence but verified that the savages had n't disturbed the memorial honoring the count de la pérouse .",40
"the prairie , across which the sledge was moving in a straight line , was as flat as a sea . it seemed like a vast frozen lake . the railroad which ran through this section ascended from the south - west to the north - west by great island , columbus , an important nebraska town , schuyler , and fremont , to omaha . it followed throughout the right bank of the platte river . the sledge , shortening this route , took a chord of the arc described by the railway . mudge was not afraid of being stopped by the platte river , because it was frozen . the road , then , was quite clear of obstacles , and phileas fogg had but two things to fear -- an accident to the sledge , and a change or calm in the wind .",41

"but at a later period a wide chasm formed diagonally from south - west to north - east , through which was gradually forced out the trachyte which was to form a mountain chain . no violence accompanied this change ; the matter thrown out was in vast quantities , and the liquid material oozing out from the abysses of the earth slowly spread in extensive plains or in hillocky masses . to this period belong the felspar , syenites , and porphyries .",13

"the breeze subsided a little towards noon , and set in from the south - west . the pilot put up his poles , but took them down again within two hours , as the wind freshened up anew .",15
"by then we were forced to go back down to the beach because the ridge had become impossible . above us , the yawning crater looked like the wide mouth of a well . from where we stood , the sky was pretty easy to see , and i watched clouds race by , disheveled by the west wind , letting tatters of mist trail over the mountain 's summit . proof positive that those clouds kept at a moderate altitude , because this volcano did n't rise more than 1,800 feet above the level of the ocean .",57
"on february 9 the nautilus cruised in the widest part of the red sea , measuring 190 miles straight across from suakin on the west coast to qunfidha on the east coast .",24

"by then we had fared nearly 13,000 leagues from our starting point in the pacific high seas . our position fix placed us in latitude 45 degrees 37 ' south and longitude 37 degrees 53 ' west . these were the same waterways where captain denham , aboard the herald , payed out 14,000 meters of sounding line without finding bottom . it was here too that lieutenant parker , aboard the american frigate congress , was unable to reach the underwater soil at 15,149 meters .",36

"the next day , april 1 , when the nautilus rose to the surface of the waves a few minutes before noon , we raised land to the west . it was tierra del fuego , the land of fire , a name given it by early navigators after they saw numerous curls of smoke rising from the natives ' huts . this land of fire forms a huge cluster of islands over thirty leagues long and eighty leagues wide , extending between latitude 53 degrees and 56 degrees south , and between longitude 67 degrees 50 ' and 77 degrees 15 ' west . its coastline looked flat , but high mountains rose in the distance . i even thought i glimpsed mt . sarmiento , whose elevation is 2,070 meters above sea level : a pyramid - shaped block of shale with a very sharp summit , which , depending on whether it 's clear or veiled in vapor , "" predicts fair weather or foul , "" as ned land told me .",103
"the sixth day of our being at sea we came into yarmouth roads ; the wind having been contrary and the weather calm , we had made but little way since the storm . here we were obliged to come to an anchor , and here we lay , the wind continuing contrary — viz . at south - west — for seven or eight days , during which time a great many ships from newcastle came into the same roads , as the common harbour where the ships might wait for a wind for the river .",59

"in this distress we had , besides the terror of the storm , one of our men die of the calenture , and one man and the boy washed overboard . about the twelfth day , the weather abating a little , the master made an observation as well as he could , and found that he was in about eleven degrees north latitude , but that he was twenty - two degrees of longitude difference west from cape st . augustino ; so that he found he was upon the coast of guiana , or the north part of brazil , beyond the river amazon , toward that of the river orinoco , commonly called the great river ; and began to consult with me what course he should take , for the ship was leaky , and very much disabled , and he was going directly back to the coast of brazil .",76
