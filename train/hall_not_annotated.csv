"it was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog had lifted . meanwhile we left lestrade in possession of the house while holmes and i went back with the baronet to baskerville hall . the story of the stapletons could no longer be withheld from him , but he took the blow bravely when he learned the truth about the woman whom he had loved . but the shock of the night 's adventures had shattered his nerves , and before morning he lay delirious in a high fever , under the care of dr . mortimer . the two of them were destined to travel together round the world before sir henry had become once more the hale , hearty man that he had been before he became master of that ill - omened estate .",37
""" certainly , though i can not guarantee that i carry all the facts in my mind . intense mental concentration has a curious way of blotting out what has passed . the barrister who has his case at his fingers ' ends , and is able to argue with an expert upon his own subject finds that a week or two of the courts will drive it all out of his head once more . so each of my cases displaces the last , and mlle . carere has blurred my recollection of baskerville hall . to - morrow some other little problem may be submitted to my notice which will in turn dispossess the fair french lady and the infamous upwood . so far as the case of the hound goes , however , i will give you the course of events as nearly as i can , and you will suggest anything which i may have forgotten .",95

"i reached the lodge at gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of the first of may : i stepped in there before going up to the hall . it was very clean and neat : the ornamental windows were hung with little white curtains ; the floor was spotless ; the grate and fire - irons were burnished bright , and the fire burnt clear . bessie sat on the hearth , nursing her last - born , and robert and his sister played quietly in a corner .",27

"traversing the long and matted gallery , i descended the slippery steps of oak ; then i gained the hall : i halted there a minute ; i looked at some pictures on the walls ( one , i remember , represented a grim man in a cuirass , and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace ) , at a bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling , at a great clock whose case was of oak curiously carved , and ebon black with time and rubbing .",19

"following the plan proposed by cyrus harding , the space was to be divided into five compartments looking out on the sea ; to the right , an entry with a door , which would meet the ladder ; then a kitchen , thirty feet long ; a dining - room , measuring forty feet ; a sleeping - room , of equal size ; and lastly , a "" visitor 's room , "" petitioned for by pencroft , and which was next to the great hall .",87

"a square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall , approached by a double stair . from this central point two long corridors extended the whole length of the building , from which all the bedrooms opened . my own was in the same wing as baskerville 's and almost next door to it . these rooms appeared to be much more modern than the central part of the house , and the bright paper and numerous candles did something to remove the sombre impression which our arrival had left upon my mind .",11
"i drew aside my curtains before i went to bed and looked out from my window . it opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of the hall door . beyond , two copses of trees moaned and swung in a rising wind . a half moon broke through the rifts of racing clouds . in its cold light i saw beyond the trees a broken fringe of rocks , and the long , low curve of the melancholy moor . i closed the curtain , feeling that my last impression was in keeping with the rest .",29
"the fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface from our minds the grim and gray impression which had been left upon both of us by our first experience of baskerville hall . as sir henry and i sat at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through the high mullioned windows , throwing watery patches of colour from the coats of arms which covered them . the dark panelling glowed like bronze in the golden rays , and it was hard to realize that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such a gloom into our souls upon the evening before .",33

"as the hall door shut , campbell started nervously , and having got up from the chair , went over to the chimney - piece . he was shivering with a kind of ague . for nearly twenty minutes , neither of the men spoke . a fly buzzed noisily about the room , and the ticking of the clock was like the beat of a hammer .",2
"adele came running to meet us in the hall , exclaiming--",8
"what was that ? in the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound — low , but very distinct in the quiet of the night . it came from the door of the house . ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently . there was a pause for a few moments , and then the low insidious sound was repeated . someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the panels of the door . was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal ? or was it some agent who was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived . john ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook his nerves and chilled his heart . springing forward he drew the bolt and threw the door open .",39
"i looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script . at the head was written : "" baskerville hall , "" and below in large , scrawling figures : "" 1742 . """,22
"and so it was arranged . resisting stapleton 's offer of hospitality , holmes and i set off to baskerville hall , leaving the naturalist to return alone . looking back we saw the figure moving slowly away over the broad moor , and behind him that one black smudge on the silvered slope which showed where the man was lying who had come so horribly to his end .",20

""" the circumstances connected with the death of sir charles can not be said to have been entirely cleared up by the inquest , but at least enough has been done to dispose of those rumours to which local superstition has given rise . there is no reason whatever to suspect foul play , or to imagine that death could be from any but natural causes . sir charles was a widower , and a man who may be said to have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind . in spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his personal tastes , and his indoor servants at baskerville hall consisted of a married couple named barrymore , the husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper . their evidence , corroborated by that of several friends , tends to show that sir charles 's health has for some time been impaired , and points especially to some affection of the heart , manifesting itself in changes of colour , breathlessness , and acute attacks of nervous depression . dr . james mortimer , the friend and medical attendant of the deceased , has given evidence to the same effect .",113

"the hall , too , was scoured ; and the great carved clock , as well as the steps and banisters of the staircase , were polished to the brightness of glass ; in the dining - room , the sideboard flashed resplendent with plate ; in the drawing - room and boudoir , vases of exotics bloomed on all sides .",1

"suddenly she came upon a little three - legged table , all made of solid glass ; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key , and alice 's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall ; but , alas ! either the locks were too large , or the key was too small , but at any rate it would not open any of them . however , on the second time round , she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before , and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high : she tried the little golden key in the lock , and to her great delight it fitted !",45
