"in that place the fiord was at least three english miles wide ; the waves rolled with a rushing din upon the sharp - pointed rocks ; this inlet was confined between walls of rock , precipices crowned by sharp peaks 2,000 feet high , and remarkable for the brown strata which separated the beds of reddish tuff . however much i might respect the intelligence of our quadrupeds , i hardly cared to put it to the test by trusting myself to it on horseback across an arm of the sea .",52,"('separate', 'séparer', 'separar')",0
