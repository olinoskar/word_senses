"finally , to conclude , conseil classified a large number of flying fish . nothing could have made a more unusual sight than the marvelous timing with which dolphins hunt these fish . whatever the range of its flight , however evasive its trajectory ( even up and over the nautilus ) , the hapless flying fish always found a dolphin to welcome it with open mouth . these were either flying gurnards or kitelike sea robins , whose lips glowed in the dark , at night scrawling fiery streaks in the air before plunging into the murky waters like so many shooting stars .",99
"under this powerful thrust the nautilus 's hull quivered like a resonating chord , and the ship sank steadily under the waters . stationed in the lounge , the captain and i watched the needle swerving swiftly over the pressure gauge . soon we had gone below the livable zone where most fish reside . some of these animals can thrive only at the surface of seas or rivers , but a minority can dwell at fairly great depths . among the latter i observed a species of dogfish called the cow shark that 's equipped with six respiratory slits , the telescope fish with its enormous eyes , the armored gurnard with gray thoracic fins plus black pectoral fins and a breastplate protected by pale red slabs of bone , then finally the grenadier , living at a depth of 1,200 meters , by that point tolerating a pressure of 120 atmospheres .",9

"i likewise marveled at the numerous medusas , including the most beautiful of their breed , the compass jellyfish , unique to the falkland seas . some of these jellyfish were shaped like very smooth , semispheric parasols with russet stripes and fringes of twelve neat festoons . others looked like upside - down baskets from which wide leaves and long red twigs were gracefully trailing . they swam with quiverings of their four leaflike arms , letting the opulent tresses of their tentacles dangle in the drift . i wanted to preserve a few specimens of these delicate zoophytes , but they were merely clouds , shadows , illusions , melting and evaporating outside their native element .",50
"some zoophytes were dredged up by the chain of our trawl . most were lovely sea anemone belonging to the family actinidia , including among other species , the phyctalis protexta , native to this part of the ocean : a small cylindrical trunk adorned with vertical lines , mottled with red spots , and crowned by a wondrous blossoming of tentacles . as for mollusks , they consisted of exhibits i had already observed : turret snails , olive shells of the "" tent olive "" species with neatly intersecting lines and russet spots standing out sharply against a flesh - colored background , fanciful spider conchs that looked like petrified scorpions , transparent glass snails , argonauts , some highly edible cuttlefish , and certain species of squid that the naturalists of antiquity classified with the flying fish , which are used chiefly as bait for catching cod .",110
"the whole thing occurred in a moment — so quickly that i had no time to realize it . i have a vivid recollection of that instant , of holmes ' triumphant expression and the ring of his voice , of the cabman 's dazed , savage face , as he glared at the glittering handcuffs , which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists . for a second or two we might have been a group of statues . then , with an inarticulate roar of fury , the prisoner wrenched himself free from holmes 's grasp , and hurled himself through the window . woodwork and glass gave way before him ; but before he got quite through , gregson , lestrade , and holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds . he was dragged back into the room , and then commenced a terrific conflict . so powerful and so fierce was he , that the four of us were shaken off again and again . he appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit . his face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass , but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance . it was not until lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and half - strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail ; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his hands . that done , we rose to our feet breathless and panting .",132

"" it will serve to take him to scotland yard . and now , gentlemen , "" he continued , with a pleasant smile , "" we have reached the end of our little mystery . you are very welcome to put any questions that you like to me now , and there is no danger that i will refuse to answer them .

"looking down on this very scene , there stood upon the fourth of may , eighteen hundred and forty - seven , a solitary traveller . his appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region . an observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty . his face was lean and haggard , and the brown parchment - like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones ; his long , brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white ; his eyes were sunken in his head , and burned with an unnatural lustre ; while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton . as he stood , he leaned upon his weapon for support , and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution . his gaunt face , however , and his clothes , which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs , proclaimed what it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance . the man was dying — dying from hunger and from thirst .",75

"during the course of the next day , april 12 , the nautilus drew near the coast of dutch guiana , by the mouth of the maroni river . there several groups of sea cows were living in family units . these were manatees , which belong to the order sirenia , like the dugong and steller 's sea cow . harmless and unaggressive , these fine animals were six to seven meters long and must have weighed at least 4,000 kilograms each . i told ned land and conseil that farseeing nature had given these mammals a major role to play . in essence , manatees , like seals , are designed to graze the underwater prairies , destroying the clusters of weeds that obstruct the mouths of tropical rivers .",108
"but now the vapors were replaced by a thick smoke , rising in the form of a grayish column , more than three hundred feet in width at its base , and which spread like an immense mushroom to a height of from seven to eight hundred feet above the summit of the mountain .",34
"the same day an odd fishing practice further increased the nautilus 's stores , so full of game were these seas . our trawl brought up in its meshes a number of fish whose heads were topped by little oval slabs with fleshy edges . these were suckerfish from the third family of the subbrachian malacopterygia . these flat disks on their heads consist of crosswise plates of movable cartilage , between which the animals can create a vacuum , enabling them to stick to objects like suction cups .",86

"it was an insane idea . fortunately i controlled myself and stretched out on the bed to soothe my bodily agitation . my nerves calmed a little , but with my brain so aroused , i did a swift review of my whole existence aboard the nautilus , every pleasant or unpleasant incident that had crossed my path since i went overboard from the abraham lincoln : the underwater hunting trip , the torres strait , our running aground , the savages of papua , the coral cemetery , the suez passageway , the island of santorini , the cretan diver , the bay of vigo , atlantis , the ice bank , the south pole , our imprisonment in the ice , the battle with the devilfish , the storm in the gulf stream , the avenger , and that horrible scene of the vessel sinking with its crew . . . ! all these events passed before my eyes like backdrops unrolling upstage in a theater . in this strange setting captain nemo then grew fantastically . his features were accentuated , taking on superhuman proportions . he was no longer my equal , he was the man of the waters , the spirit of the seas .",161

"it was possible , i reflected , that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene , of the details of the picture , would be sufficient to modify , or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression ; and , acting upon this idea , i reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling , and gazed down — but with a shudder even more thrilling than before — upon the remodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge , and the ghastly tree - stems , and the vacant and eye - like windows .",110
