""" exactly . i fancy the yew alley , though not marked under that name , must stretch along this line , with the moor , as you perceive , upon the right of it . this small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of grimpen , where our friend dr . mortimer has his headquarters . within a radius of five miles there are , as you see , only a very few scattered dwellings . here is lafter hall , which was mentioned in the narrative . there is a house indicated here which may be the residence of the naturalist -- stapleton , if i remember right , was his name . here are two moorland farm - houses , high tor and foulmire . then fourteen miles away the great convict prison of princetown . between and around these scattered points extends the desolate , lifeless moor . this , then , is the stage upon which tragedy has been played , and upon which we may help to play it again .

"the captain said a few words to his chief officer who went out immediately . soon the nautilus reentered its liquid element , and the pressure gauge indicated that it was staying at a depth of thirty feet .",27
"mr . fogg 's wardrobe was amply supplied and in the best taste . each pair of trousers , coat , and vest bore a number , indicating the time of year and season at which they were in turn to be laid out for wearing ; and the same system was applied to the master 's shoes .",27
"our breakfast - table was cleared early , and holmes waited in his dressing - gown for the promised interview . our clients were punctual to their appointment , for the clock had just struck ten when dr . mortimer was shown up , followed by the young baronet . the latter was a small , alert , dark - eyed man about thirty years of age , very sturdily built , with thick black eyebrows and a strong , pugnacious face . he wore a ruddy - tinted tweed suit and had the weather - beaten appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air , and yet there was something in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated the gentleman .",129
"immediately , without any order being given or his place of destination indicated , the coachman set off at a rapid pace , and plunged into the streets of the city .",12
"here and there i could see puffs and jets of steam curling up into the air , called in icelandic ' reykir , ' issuing from thermal springs , and indicating by their motion the volcanic energy underneath . this seemed to justify my fears : but i fell from the height of my new - born hopes when my uncle said :",30
"athos walked in the direction indicated , and reached the suburb situated at the opposite extremity of the city from that by which he and his friends had entered it .",5
""" sir , "" captain nemo said , showing me the instruments hanging on the walls of his stateroom , "" these are the devices needed to navigate the nautilus . here , as in the lounge , i always have them before my eyes , and they indicate my position and exact heading in the midst of the ocean . you 're familiar with some of them , such as the thermometer , which gives the temperature inside the nautilus ; the barometer , which measures the heaviness of the outside air and forecasts changes in the weather ; the humidistat , which indicates the degree of dryness in the atmosphere ; the storm glass , whose mixture decomposes to foretell the arrival of tempests ; the compass , which steers my course ; the sextant , which takes the sun 's altitude and tells me my latitude ; chronometers , which allow me to calculate my longitude ; and finally , spyglasses for both day and night , enabling me to scrutinize every point of the horizon once the nautilus has risen to the surface of the waves .

"on the 13th they passed the edge of the banks of newfoundland , a dangerous locality ; during the winter , especially , there are frequent fogs and heavy gales of wind . ever since the evening before the barometer , suddenly falling , had indicated an approaching change in the atmosphere ; and during the night the temperature varied , the cold became sharper , and the wind veered to the south - east .",45
"this was plain to all , and , by cyrus harding 's orders , they reached the spot indicated by him , while the colpeos rushed fiercely through the gloom .",18
""" another use for electricity : that dial hanging before our eyes indicates how fast the nautilus is going . an electric wire puts it in contact with the patent log ; this needle shows me the actual speed of my submersible . and . . . hold on . . . just now we 're proceeding at the moderate pace of fifteen miles per hour . """,12
"after going down a fairly steep slope , our feet trod the floor of a sort of circular pit . there captain nemo stopped , and his hand indicated an object that i had n't yet noticed . it was an oyster of extraordinary dimensions , a titanic giant clam , a holy - water font that could have held a whole lake , a basin more than two meters wide , hence even bigger than the one adorning the nautilus 's lounge .",28
"but cyrus harding , less confident , advised them to confine themselves to fact , and more especially so with regard to the building of a vessel -- a really urgent work , since it was for the purpose of depositing , as soon as possible , at tabor island a document indicating ayrton 's new residence .",52
"the direction was indicated by the river , whose course they had only to follow , and , towards six o'clock , tired enough with their excursion , herbert and pencroft arrived at the chimneys .",3
just then the pressure gauge indicated we were no more than twenty feet from the surface . separating us from the open air was a mere tract of ice . could we break through it ?,5
"the captain pressed an electric bell three times . the pumps began to expel water from the ballast tanks ; on the pressure gauge , a needle marked the decreasing pressures that indicated the nautilus 's upward progress ; then the needle stopped .",32
every eye looked toward the point indicated .,6
"when the clock indicated twenty minutes past eight , andrew stuart got up , saying , "" gentlemen , in twenty minutes the time agreed upon between mr . fogg and ourselves will have expired . """,3
"if there was one report there might be others , so i looked round the hut in search of them . there was no trace , however , of anything of the kind , nor could i discover any sign which might indicate the character or intentions of the man who lived in this singular place , save that he must be of spartan habits and cared little for the comforts of life . when i thought of the heavy rains and looked at the gaping roof i understood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that inhospitable abode . was he our malignant enemy , or was he by chance our guardian angel ? i swore that i would not leave the hut until i knew .",42
the clock indicated eighteen minutes to nine .,2
""" your affair is not bad , "" said athos , after having tasted like a connoisseur and indicated by a nod of his head that he thought the wine good ; "" and one may draw fifty or sixty pistoles from this good man .",18
"arriving within a few cable lengths of the cetacean , our longboat slowed down , and the sculls dipped noiselessly into the tranquil waters . harpoon in hand , ned land went to take his stand in the skiff 's bow . harpoons used for hunting whales are usually attached to a very long rope that pays out quickly when the wounded animal drags it with him . but this rope measured no more than about ten fathoms , and its end had simply been fastened to a small barrel that , while floating , would indicate the dugong 's movements beneath the waters .",96
"dâ€™artagnan walked quickly in the direction indicated , and found one of those exterior staircases that are still to be seen in the yards of our old - fashioned taverns .",6
""" that seems the most reasonable theory , "" said stapleton , and he gave a sigh which i took to indicate his relief . "" what do you think about it , mr . sherlock holmes ? """,21
"pencroft , seizing the telescope , rapidly swept the horizon , and stopping on the indicated point , that is to say , on that which had made the almost imperceptible spot on the photographic negative,--",15
"just then the chief officer drew the captain 's attention anew . the latter interrupted his strolling and aimed his spyglass at the point indicated . he observed it a good while . as for me , deeply puzzled , i went below to the lounge and brought back an excellent long - range telescope i habitually used . leaning my elbows on the beacon housing , which jutted from the stern of the platform , i got set to scour that whole stretch of sky and sea . but no sooner had i peered into the eyepiece than the instrument was snatched from my hands .",24
the heat increases . i refer to the thermometer ; it indicates . . . ( the figure is obliterated ) .,11
all eyes turned towards the point indicated .,6
"a small fly or moth had fluttered across our path , and in an instant stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it . to my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire , and my acquaintance never paused for an instant , bounding from tuft to tuft behind it , his green net waving in the air . his gray clothes and jerky , zigzag , irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself . i was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the treacherous mire , when i heard the sound of steps , and turning round found a woman near me upon the path . she had come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of merripit house , but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close .",144
ayrton took the glass and pointed it in the direction indicated .,10
"but the skies became more and more threatening . there were conspicuous signs of a hurricane on the way . the atmosphere was turning white and milky . slender sheaves of cirrus clouds were followed on the horizon by layers of nimbocumulus . other low clouds fled swiftly . the sea grew towering , inflated by long swells . every bird had disappeared except a few petrels , friends of the storms . the barometer fell significantly , indicating a tremendous tension in the surrounding haze . the mixture in our stormglass decomposed under the influence of the electricity charging the air . a struggle of the elements was approaching .",78
"quiescent as he now sat , there was something about his nostril , his mouth , his brow , which , to my perceptions , indicated elements within either restless , or hard , or eager .",25
""" no , "" he said coolly : "" when you have indicated to us the residence of your friends , we can write to them , and you may be restored to home . """,12
"for a quarter of an hour the boat had been advancing , making detours , indicated to pencroft by the engineer in short sentences , when all at once,--",15
the cries of the terrified musmons and goats indicated the alarm which possessed them .,8
"this was also indicated by the second case of metal which had preserved them from damp , and which could not have been soldered in a moment of haste .",3
"2 . an aneroid barometer , to indicate extreme pressures of the atmosphere . an ordinary barometer would not have answered the purpose , as the pressure would increase during our descent to a point which the mercurial barometer [ 1 ] would not register .",7
"i could observe these strange walls quite closely : our sounding lines indicated that they dropped perpendicularly for more than 300 meters , and our electric beams made the bright limestone positively sparkle .",12
