"all the mundane objects that generally strike the eye on entering the room of a young man , particularly when that young man is a musketeer , had disappeared as if by enchantment ; and for fear , no doubt , that the sight of them might bring his master back to ideas of this world , bazin had laid his hands upon sword , pistols , plumed hat , and embroideries and laces of all kinds and sorts .",59

"i am now to be supposed retired into my castle , after my late voyage to the wreck , my frigate laid up and secured under water , as usual , and my condition restored to what it was before : i had more wealth , indeed , than i had before , but was not at all the richer ; for i had no more use for it than the indians of peru had before the spaniards came there .",21
"this great hatred which the young traveler manifested so loudly for this man , who -- a rather improbable thing -- had stolen his father ’s letter from him -- was there not some perfidy concealed under this hatred ? might not this young man be sent by his eminence ? might he not have come for the purpose of laying a snare for him ? this pretended d’artagnan -- was he not an emissary of the cardinal , whom the cardinal sought to introduce into treville ’s house , to place near him , to win his confidence , and afterward to ruin him as had been done in a thousand other instances ?",60

"we had finally arrived on the outskirts of this forest , surely one of the finest in captain nemo 's immense domains . he regarded it as his own and had laid the same claim to it that , in the first days of the world , the first men had to their forests on land . besides , who else could dispute his ownership of this underwater property ? what other , bolder pioneer would come , ax in hand , to clear away its dark underbrush ?",31
"upon the whole , as i found by all his discourse a settled affection to me , and that nothing could part him from me , so i found all the foundation of his desire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent affection to the people , and his hopes of my doing them good ; a thing which , as i had no notion of myself , so i had not the least thought or intention , or desire of undertaking it . but still i found a strong inclination to attempting my escape , founded on the supposition gathered from the discourse , that there were seventeen bearded men there ; and therefore , without any more delay , i went to work with friday to find out a great tree proper to fell , and make a large periagua , or canoe , to undertake the voyage . there were trees enough in the island to have built a little fleet , not of periaguas or canoes , but even of good , large vessels ; but the main thing i looked at was , to get one so near the water that we might launch it when it was made , to avoid the mistake i committed at first .",42

""" this was the first point gained . i then walked slowly down the garden path , which happened to be composed of a clay soil , peculiarly suitable for taking impressions . no doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush , but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning . there is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps . happily , i have always laid great stress upon it , and much practice has made it second nature to me . i saw the heavy footmarks of the constables , but i saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden . it was easy to tell that they had been before the others , because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them . in this way my second link was formed , which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number , one remarkable for his height ( as i calculated from the length of his stride ) , and the other fashionably dressed , to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots .",89
