"while they were thus occupied , their companions went to the border of jacamar wood , and brought back a large quantity of branches and creepers , which would at some distance appear as natural foliage , and thus disguise the windows in the granite cliff .",14
"during the month of july the cold was intense , but there was no lack of either wood or coal .",17
"they therefore waited impatiently for the moment when herbert might be moved without danger from his wound , and they were determined to make this move , although the communication through jacamar wood was very difficult .",32
by throwing in some bits of wood he found that it set towards the southern angle .,6
"in a few minutes the explorers arrived at the angle formed by the mercy and exactly at the place where , seven months before , pencroft had made his first raft of wood .",32
"pencroft , although he had no confidence in the proceeding , then tried rubbing two pieces of dry wood together , as savages do .",18
"herbert had taken the bits of wood which he had turned down , and was exerting himself to rub them .",6
"and there i was , fantasizing about sharks , envisioning huge jaws armed with multiple rows of teeth and capable of cutting a man in half . i could already feel a definite pain around my pelvic girdle . and how i resented the offhand manner in which the captain had extended his deplorable invitation ! you would have thought it was an issue of going into the woods on some harmless fox hunt !",68
"when harding and the reporter entered the chimneys , they found herbert and pencroft unloading their raft of wood .",18
"some handfuls of grass , leaves , and dry moss were placed under the fagots and disposed in such a way that the air could easily circulate , and the dry wood would rapidly catch fire .",31
"as to the forest , including jacamar wood , as well as the forests of the far west , it extended as far as the eye could reach .",7
"however , on his second sortie , on the 27th of november , gideon spilett , who had ventured a quarter of a mile into the woods , towards the south of the mountain , remarked that top scented something .",26
"if castaways had landed on the island , they could not have yet quitted the shore , and it was not in the woods that the survivors of the supposed shipwreck should be sought .",23
"a minute later the dry wood crackled and a cheerful flame , assisted by the vigorous blowing of the sailor , sprang up in the midst of the darkness .",5
"on this ground he placed a layer of branches and chopped wood , on which were piled some pieces of shistose pyrites , buttressed one against the other , the whole being covered with a thin layer of pyrites , previously reduced to the size of a nut .",11
"this done , they set fire to the wood , the heat was communicated to the shist , which soon kindled , since it contains coal and sulphur .",8
"then new layers of bruised pyrites were arranged so as to form an immense heap , the exterior of which was covered with earth and grass , several air - holes being left , as if it was a stack of wood which was to be carbonized to make charcoal .",41
"it was both fatigue spared and time gained , for they would have been obliged to cut a path through the thick wood with their axes .",22
"the onagers , who had two pretty colts , were most often mounted by gideon spilett and herbert , who had become an excellent rider under the reporter 's instruction , and they also harnessed them to the cart either for carrying wood and coal to granite house , or different mineral productions required by the engineer .",42
""" i think that you are mistaken , pencroft , "" replied gideon spilett , "" and that the wood of the eucalyptus has begun to be very advantageously employed in cabinet - making . """,19
he was already taught to make himself useful by drawing loads of wood and carting away the stones which were extracted from the bed of creek glycerine .,12
"neb , herbert , and the sailor were to return to the forest , renew their store of wood , and lay violent hands on every creature , feathered or hairy , which might come within their reach .",18
""" we will hunt , then , "" said the sailor , "" and afterwards we can come back and collect our wood . """,22
"this game was eaten fresh , but they preserved some capybara hams , by smoking them above a fire of green wood , after having perfumed them with sweet - smelling leaves .",21
"they could hear the tempest raging in jacamar wood , which would surely suffer from it .",8
"at the corner of the pine - wood he caught sight of sir geoffrey clouston , the duchess 's brother , jerking two spent cartridges out of his gun . he jumped from the cart , and having told the groom to take the mare home , made his way towards his guest through the withered bracken and rough undergrowth .",7
"dorian strolled along by his side . the keen aromatic air , the brown and red lights that glimmered in the wood , the hoarse cries of the beaters ringing out from time to time , and the sharp snaps of the guns that followed , fascinated him and filled him with a sense of delightful freedom . he was dominated by the carelessness of happiness , by the high indifference of joy .",21
"what a sight ! how can i describe it ! how can i portray these woods and rocks in this liquid setting , their lower parts dark and sullen , their upper parts tinted red in this light whose intensity was doubled by the reflecting power of the waters ! we scaled rocks that crumbled behind us , collapsing in enormous sections with the hollow rumble of an avalanche . to our right and left there were carved gloomy galleries where the eye lost its way . huge glades opened up , seemingly cleared by the hand of man , and i sometimes wondered whether some residents of these underwater regions would suddenly appear before me .",15
"as to the mercy , it was more directly fed from ample springs concealed under the cover of jacamar wood , and it was by springs of this nature , spreading in a thousand streamlets , that the soil of the serpentine peninsula was watered .",19
the road was as deserted as all that part of the jacamar wood which lay between the mercy and the lake .,12
"several excursions were made into the jacamar wood and the forests of the far west , and they brought back from thence a large collection of wild vegetables , spinach , cress , radishes , and turnips , which careful culture would soon improve , and which would temper the regimen on which the settlers had till then subsisted .",7
i led him out of the wet and wild wood into some cheerful fields : i described to him how brilliantly green they were ; how the flowers and hedges looked refreshed ; how sparklingly blue was the sky .,9
""" and made a good choice of an attendant for you in alice wood ? """,13
"pencroft soon made a raft of wood , as he had done before , though if there was no fire it would be a useless task , and the raft following the current , they returned towards the chimneys .",6
"when his services were not required , either for carrying wood or for climbing to the top of some tree , jup passed the greatest part of his time in the kitchen , where he endeavored to imitate neb in all that he saw him do .",10
"the son , who had been his father 's secretary , had resigned along with his chief , somewhat foolishly as was thought at the time , and on succeeding some months later to the title , had set himself to the serious study of the great aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing . he had two large town houses , but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble , and took most of his meals at his club . he paid some attention to the management of his collieries in the midland counties , excusing himself for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of burning wood on his own hearth .",127
"it was necessary to have dry wood to keep the steam up to the adequate pressure , and on that day the poop , cabins , bunks , and the spare deck were sacrificed . on the next day , the 19th of december , the masts , rafts , and spars were burned ; the crew worked lustily , keeping up the fires . passepartout hewed , cut , and sawed away with all his might . there was a perfect rage for demolition .",6
"no portion of the masonry had fallen ; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts , and the crumbling condition of the individual stones . in this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old wood - work which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault , with no disturbance from the breath of the external air .",47
"the trees on the right bank were as close together as on the left bank , and it was impossible to distinguish anything beyond them ; but these masses of wood were evidently uninhabited , for top did not bark , and the intelligent animal would not have failed to signal the presence of any stranger in the neighborhood .",30
the fastening was fixed with a strong acacia thorn which was found in the wood pile .,14
"one day when miss cunegund went to take a walk in a little neighboring wood which was called a park , she saw , through the bushes , the sage doctor pangloss giving a lecture in experimental philosophy to her mother 's chambermaid , a little brown wench , very pretty , and very tractable .",14
"in order to fix the angle obtained , he fastened with thorns the two pieces of wood on a third placed transversely , so that their separation should be properly maintained .",16
"the chimneys had again become more habitable , not only because the passages were warmed by the fire , but because the partitions of wood and mud had been re - established .",24
"the meal ended , fresh armfuls of wood were thrown on the fire , and the inhabitants of the chimneys , including the faithful top , were soon buried in a deep sleep .",7
"besides , it might be supposed that in all probability either the convicts knew of the return of the settlers to granite house , by having seen them pass on the road from the corral , or , after the devastation of the plateau , they had penetrated into jacamar wood , following the course of the mercy , and were thus ignorant of their return .",50
"herbert had just thrown on an armful of dry wood , and the flame cast a bright light into the darkest parts of the passage .",9
"while neb skinned the jaguar , his companions collected an abundant supply of dry wood from the forest , which they heaped up at the cave .",14
"hallward shook his head , as he entered , and followed dorian into the library . there was a bright wood fire blazing in the large open hearth . the lamps were lit , and an open dutch silver spirit - case stood , with some siphons of soda - water and large cut - glass tumblers , on a little marqueterie table .",20
"this done , they entered the grotto , of which the floor was strewn with bones , the guns were carefully loaded , in case of a sudden attack , they had supper , and then just before they lay down to rest , the heap of wood piled at the entrance was set fire to .",47
"he brushed their clothes , he turned the spit , he waited at table , he swept the rooms , he gathered wood , and he performed another admirable piece of service which delighted pencroft -- he never went to sleep without first coming to tuck up the worthy sailor in his bed .",22

""" mr . wood is in the vestry , sir , putting on his surplice . """,3
""" but surely , then , like other fossil wood , it must be as hard as stone , and can not float ? """,9
""" sometimes that may happen ; some of these woods become true anthracites ; but others , such as this , have only gone through the first stage of fossil transformation . just look , "" added my uncle , throwing into the sea one of those precious waifs .",9
"henceforward all the loads , wood , coal , provisions , and even the settlers themselves , were hoisted by this simple system , which replaced the primitive ladder , and , as may be supposed , no one thought of regretting the change .",5
"profound silence fell when he had uttered that word , with deep but low intonation . presently mr . wood said--",19
"i see trees laden with ripening fruit . i hear a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off ; no moving form is visible , no coming step audible ; but that perfume increases : i must flee .",15
"mr . wood seemed at a loss . "" what is the nature of the impediment ? "" he asked . "" perhaps it may be got over -- explained away ? """,2
an armful of dry wood was thrown on the embers .,4
"all the colonists , their services thus requisitioned by pencroft , descended to the dockyard , and proceeded to place the keelson , a thick mass of wood which forms the lower portion of a ship and unites firmly the timbers of the hull .",27
"wood , close your book and take off your surplice ; john green ( to the clerk ) , leave the church : there will be no wedding to - day . """,0
"as yet , they only hunted in jacamar wood , on the left of the river , because , for want of a bridge or boat , the mercy had not yet been crossed .",8
"all the immense woods , to which the name of the forests of the far west had been given , were not explored .",3
"but they had in no way surveyed the woods which covered the serpentine peninsula , all to the right of the mercy , the left bank of falls river , and the wilderness of spurs and valleys which supported three quarters of the base of mount franklin , to the east , the north , and the west , and where doubtless many secret retreats existed .",8
"briggs , wood , mason , i invite you all to come up to the house and visit mrs . poole 's patient , and _ my wife _ ! you shall see what sort of a being i was cheated into espousing , and judge whether or not i had a right to break the compact , and seek sympathy with something at least human .",2

"the road led through jacamar wood , which they traversed obliquely from southeast to northwest , and in the thickest part .",5
"the exploration of these dense masses of wood was difficult in the extreme , and the reporter never ventured there without the pocket - compass , for the sun scarcely pierced through the thick foliage and it would have been very difficult for them to retrace their way .",7
"_ april _ 22.—the next morning i begin to consider of means to put this resolve into execution ; but i was at a great loss about my tools . i had three large axes , and abundance of hatchets ( for we carried the hatchets for traffic with the indians ) ; but with much chopping and cutting knotty hard wood , they were all full of notches , and dull ; and though i had a grindstone , i could not turn it and grind my tools too . this cost me as much thought as a statesman would have bestowed upon a grand point of politics , or a judge upon the life and death of a man . at length i contrived a wheel with a string , to turn it with my foot , that i might have both my hands at liberty .",61
"the river became strong almost directly between the two walls of granite , which began to sink above the mouth ; it then suddenly turned and disappeared beneath a wood of stunted trees half a mile off .",29
""" here is the water , and yonder is the wood we require ! "" said pencroft .",10
"an hour after their departure they arrived on the southern point of the islet , terminated by a sharp cape , and proceeded towards the north along the western coast , equally formed by sand and rocks , the background bordered with thick woods .",43
"the current here was quite rapid , and drifted down some dead wood .",12
"the time seemed long ; the guide ever and anon left them to take an observation on the edge of the wood , but the guards watched steadily by the glare of the torches , and a dim light crept through the windows of the pagoda .",21
"then coal and ore were arranged in heaps and in successive layers , as the charcoal - burner does with the wood which he wishes to carbonize .",21
"they set noiselessly to work , and the parsee on one side and passepartout on the other began to loosen the bricks so as to make an aperture two feet wide . they were getting on rapidly , when suddenly a cry was heard in the interior of the temple , followed almost instantly by other cries replying from the outside . passepartout and the guide stopped . had they been heard ? was the alarm being given ? common prudence urged them to retire , and they did so , followed by phileas fogg and sir francis . they again hid themselves in the wood , and waited till the disturbance , whatever it might be , ceased , holding themselves ready to resume their attempt without delay . but , awkwardly enough , the guards now appeared at the rear of the temple , and there installed themselves , in readiness to prevent a surprise .",105
""" well , my boy , "" said he to herbert , "" if i do n't know the name of these trees , at any rate i reckon that we may call them ' burning wood , ' and just now that 's the chief thing we want . """,36
"it was not even necessary to lop the trees , for enormous quantities of dead wood were lying at their feet ; but if fuel was not wanting , the means of transporting it was not yet found .",15
at last the woods rose ; the rookery clustered dark ; a loud cawing broke the morning stillness .,3
"they both carried , each in proportion to his strength , a load of wood bound in fagots .",14
"at the back was a rude fireplace , with a few cold cinders , supporting an armful of dry wood .",19
"a moment after all four of the party had disappeared in the woods , and the elephant was bearing them away at a rapid pace . but the cries and noise , and a ball which whizzed through phileas fogg 's hat , apprised them that the trick had been discovered .",12

"it was then agreed that the night should be passed in the deserted dwelling , and a store of wood found in a corner was sufficient to warm it .",19
"from its first declivities to within two miles of the coast were spread vast masses of wood , relieved by large green patches , caused by the presence of evergreen trees .",16
"at the point where the sailor had left his raft of wood , it began to run between the two high granite walls ; but if on the left bank the wall remained clear and abrupt , on the right bank , on the contrary , it sank gradually , the massive sides changed to isolated rocks , the rocks to stones , the stones to shingle running to the extremity of the point .",11
"after we had dined , or rather supped , i ordered friday to take one of the canoes , and go and fetch our muskets and other firearms , which , for want of time , we had left upon the place of battle ; and the next day i ordered him to go and bury the dead bodies of the savages , which lay open to the sun , and would presently be offensive . i also ordered him to bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast , which i could not think of doing myself ; nay , i could not bear to see them if i went that way ; all which he punctually performed , and effaced the very appearance of the savages being there ; so that when i went again , i could scarce know where it was , otherwise than by the corner of the wood pointing to the place .",153
""" the glamour of inexperience is over your eyes , "" he answered ; "" and you see it through a charmed medium : you can not discern that the gilding is slime and the silk draperies cobwebs ; that the marble is sordid slate , and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark .",49
"the old - fashioned chairs were very bright , and the walnut - wood table was like a looking - glass .",13
the tide had already turned . they must now avail themselves of the ebb to take the wood to the mouth .,17
"it was made of oak wood , very carefully closed and covered with a thick hide , which was secured by copper nails .",5
"it was about two hours before night when , our guide being something before us , and not just in sight , out rushed three monstrous wolves , and after them a bear , from a hollow way adjoining to a thick wood ; two of the wolves made at the guide , and had he been far before us , he would have been devoured before we could have helped him ; one of them fastened upon his horse , and the other attacked the man with such violence , that he had not time , or presence of mind enough , to draw his pistol , but hallooed and cried out to us most lustily . my man friday being next me , i bade him ride up and see what was the matter . as soon as friday came in sight of the man , he hallooed out as loud as the other , “ o master ! o master ! ” but like a bold fellow , rode directly up to the poor man , and with his pistol shot the wolf in the head that attacked him .",42
"we had , first and last , killed about threescore of them , and had it been daylight we had killed many more . the field of battle being thus cleared , we made forward again , for we had still near a league to go . we heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the woods as we went several times , and sometimes we fancied we saw some of them ; but the snow dazzling our eyes , we were not certain . in about an hour more we came to the town where we were to lodge , which we found in a terrible fright and all in arms ; for , it seems , the night before the wolves and some bears had broken into the village , and put them in such terror that they were obliged to keep guard night and day , but especially in the night , to preserve their cattle , and indeed their people .",57
"pencroft also had wisely not waited till the river was frozen , but had brought enormous rafts of wood to their destination .",18
"their wood was stowed away in one of the rooms , and the sailor laid in the fireplace some logs and brushwood .",1
"the current was an indefatigable moving power , and it was employed in conveying the floating wood to the moment when the frost enchained it .",16
"it was , in fact , towards the corral that the lava was rushing as the new crater faced the east , and consequently the fertile portions of the island , the springs of red creek and jacamar wood , were menaced with instant destruction .",38
"even when within a very short distance of the manor - house , you could see nothing of it , so thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it .",30
"the soil sloped gradually from mount franklin to the east coast , and it was to be feared that , in spite of the thick jacamar wood , the torrent would reach the plateau of prospect heights .",26
"entering a portal , fastened only by a latch , i stood amidst a space of enclosed ground , from which the wood swept away in a semicircle .",22
"so she swallowed one of the cakes , and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly . as soon as she was small enough to get through the door , she ran out of the house , and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside . the poor little lizard , bill , was in the middle , being held up by two guinea - pigs , who were giving it something out of a bottle . they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared ; but she ran off as hard as she could , and soon found herself safe in a thick wood .",113
"towards seven in the morning the position was no longer tenable by the colonists , who accordingly took shelter in the borders of jacamar wood .",24
"the next day , the 7th of may , harding and gideon spilett , leaving neb to prepare breakfast , climbed prospect heights , while herbert and pencroft ascended by the river , to renew their store of wood .",38
