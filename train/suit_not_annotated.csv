"a week later dorian gray was sitting in the conservatory at selby royal , talking to the pretty duchess of monmouth , who with her husband , a jaded - looking man of sixty , was amongst his guests . it was tea- time , and the mellow light of the huge , lace - covered lamp that stood on the table lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service at which the duchess was presiding . her white hands were moving daintily among the cups , and her full red lips were smiling at something that dorian had whispered to her . lord henry was lying back in a silk - draped wicker chair , looking at them . on a peach - coloured divan sat lady narborough , pretending to listen to the duke 's description of the last brazilian beetle that he had added to his collection . three young men in elaborate smoking - suits were handing tea - cakes to some of the women . the house - party consisted of twelve people , and there were more expected to arrive on the next day .",161

"our breakfast - table was cleared early , and holmes waited in his dressing - gown for the promised interview . our clients were punctual to their appointment , for the clock had just struck ten when dr . mortimer was shown up , followed by the young baronet . the latter was a small , alert , dark - eyed man about thirty years of age , very sturdily built , with thick black eyebrows and a strong , pugnacious face . he wore a ruddy - tinted tweed suit and had the weather - beaten appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air , and yet there was something in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated the gentleman .",90

"around the nautilus for a half - mile radius , the waters seemed saturated with electric light . the sandy bottom was clear and bright . dressed in diving suits , crewmen were busy clearing away half - rotted barrels and disemboweled trunks in the midst of the dingy hulks of ships . out of these trunks and kegs spilled ingots of gold and silver , cascades of jewels , pieces of eight . the sand was heaped with them . then , laden with these valuable spoils , the men returned to the nautilus , dropped off their burdens inside , and went to resume this inexhaustible fishing for silver and gold .",29

"as we moved forward , i heard a kind of pitter - patter above my head . sometimes this noise increased and became a continuous crackle . i soon realized the cause . it was a heavy rainfall rattling on the surface of the waves . instinctively i worried that i might get soaked ! by water in the midst of water ! i could n't help smiling at this outlandish notion . but to tell the truth , wearing these heavy diving suits , you no longer feel the liquid element , you simply think you 're in the midst of air a little denser than air on land , that 's all .",83
""" not yet . i have n't let the nautilus pull too near the coast , and we 're fairly well out from the mannar oysterbank . but i have the skiff ready , and it will take us to the exact spot where we 'll disembark , which will save us a pretty long trek . it 's carrying our diving equipment , and we 'll suit up just before we begin our underwater exploring .

"i did n't reply , and while staring at these suspicious waves , i began to put on my heavy aquatic clothes , helped by the longboat 's sailors . captain nemo and my two companions suited up as well . none of the nautilus 's men were to go with us on this new excursion .",36

"during the night , in line with my forecasts , a new one - meter slice was removed from this immense socket . but in the morning , wearing my diving suit , i was crossing through the liquid mass in a temperature of -6 degrees to -7 degrees centigrade , when i noted that little by little the side walls were closing in on each other . the liquid strata farthest from the trench , not warmed by the movements of workmen and tools , were showing a tendency to solidify . in the face of this imminent new danger , what would happen to our chances for salvation , and how could we prevent this liquid medium from solidifying , then cracking the nautilus 's hull like glass ?",31
"the captain understood and gave me a signal to follow him . we returned on board . my diving suit removed , i went with him to the lounge .",19
"and above all , what must he have thought when captain nemo pulled a bag of pearls from a pocket in his diving suit and placed it in the fisherman 's hands ? this magnificent benefaction from the man of the waters to the poor indian from ceylon was accepted by the latter with trembling hands . his bewildered eyes indicated that he did n't know to what superhuman creatures he owed both his life and his fortune .",23

"was this done on purpose ? or was it a mistake ? did he want to reduce us by famine ? this seemed like going rather too far ! what ! should martha and i be victims of a position of things in which we had not the smallest interest ? it was a fact that a few years before this , whilst my uncle was working at his great classification of minerals , he was forty - eight hours without eating , and all his household were obliged to share in this scientific fast . as for me , what i remember is , that i got severe cramps in my stomach , which hardly suited the constitution of a hungry , growing lad .",116

""" in order to steer this boat to port or starboard , in short , to make turns on a horizontal plane , i use an ordinary , wide - bladed rudder that 's fastened to the rear of the sternpost and worked by a wheel and tackle . but i can also move the nautilus upward and downward on a vertical plane by the simple method of slanting its two fins , which are attached to its sides at its center of flotation ; these fins are flexible , able to assume any position , and can be operated from inside by means of powerful levers . if these fins stay parallel with the boat , the latter moves horizontally . if they slant , the nautilus follows the angle of that slant and , under its propeller 's thrust , either sinks on a diagonal as steep as it suits me , or rises on that diagonal . and similarly , if i want to return more swiftly to the surface , i throw the propeller in gear , and the water 's pressure makes the nautilus rise vertically , as an air balloon inflated with hydrogen lifts swiftly into the skies .

"for years , dorian gray could not free himself from the influence of this book . or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never sought to free himself from it . he procured from paris no less than nine large - paper copies of the first edition , and had them bound in different colours , so that they might suit his various moods and the changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed , at times , to have almost entirely lost control . the hero , the wonderful young parisian in whom the romantic and the scientific temperaments were so strangely blended , became to him a kind of prefiguring type of himself . and , indeed , the whole book seemed to him to contain the story of his own life , written before he had lived it .",64
