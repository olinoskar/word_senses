"the thermometer marked -12 degrees centigrade , and a fresh breeze left a sharp nip in the air . ice floes were increasing over the open water . the sea was starting to congeal everywhere . numerous blackish patches were spreading over its surface , announcing the imminent formation of fresh ice . obviously this southernmost basin froze over during its six - month winter and became utterly inaccessible . what happened to the whales during this period ? no doubt they went beneath the ice bank to find more feasible seas . as for seals and walruses , they were accustomed to living in the harshest climates and stayed on in these icy waterways . these animals know by instinct how to gouge holes in the ice fields and keep them continually open ; they go to these holes to breathe . once the birds have migrated northward to escape the cold , these marine mammals remain as sole lords of the polar continent .",4,"('degree', 'degré', 'grado')",1
