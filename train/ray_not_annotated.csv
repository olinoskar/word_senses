"in essence , it was precisely march 20 . tomorrow , the 21st , was the day of the equinox ; the sun would disappear below the horizon for six months not counting refraction , and after its disappearance the long polar night would begin . following the september equinox , the sun had emerged above the northerly horizon , rising in long spirals until december 21 . at that time , the summer solstice of these southernmost districts , the sun had started back down , and tomorrow it would cast its last rays .",94
"we had long lost sight of the sea shore behind the hills of bones . the rash professor , careless of losing his way , hurried me forward . we advanced in silence , bathed in luminous electric fluid . by some phenomenon which i am unable to explain , it lighted up all sides of every object equally . such was its diffusiveness , there being no central point from which the light emanated , that shadows no longer existed . you might have thought yourself under the rays of a vertical sun in a tropical region at noonday and the height of summer . no vapour was visible . the rocks , the distant mountains , a few isolated clumps of forest trees in the distance , presented a weird and wonderful aspect under these totally new conditions of a universal diffusion of light . we were like hoffmann 's shadowless man .",89
"i could barely glimpse the swift passing of longnose sharks , hammerhead sharks , spotted dogfish that frequent these waters , big eagle rays , swarms of seahorse looking like knights on a chessboard , eels quivering like fireworks serpents , armies of crab that fled obliquely by crossing their pincers over their carapaces , finally schools of porpoise that held contests of speed with the nautilus . but by this point observing , studying , and classifying were out of the question .",23
"at last , at eleven in the sunlight night , the summit of snæfell was reached , and before going in for shelter into the crater i had time to observe the midnight sun , at his lowest point , gilding with his pale rays the island that slept at my feet .",44
"at six o'clock the day broke suddenly , with that speed unique to tropical regions , which experience no real dawn or dusk . the sun 's rays pierced the cloud curtain gathered on the easterly horizon , and the radiant orb rose swiftly .",27
"they saw his eyes wander over all the marvels of this saloon , lighted by the electric rays which fell from the arabesques of the luminous ceiling .",17
""" our lighting equipment would be useless to us , "" the captain answered me . "" we wo n't be going very deep , and the sun 's rays will be sufficient to light our way . besides , it 's unwise to carry electric lanterns under these waves . their brightness might unexpectedly attract certain dangerous occupants of these waterways . """,29
"i heard one of your kind an hour ago , singing high over the wood : but its song had no music for me , any more than the rising sun had rays .",32
"just then the moon appeared for an instant through the watery mass , casting a few pale rays over this submerged continent . it was only a fleeting glimmer , but its effect was indescribable . the captain stood up and took one last look at these immense plains ; then his hand signaled me to follow him .",17
"just then a huge cave opened up in our path , hollowed from a picturesque pile of rocks whose smooth heights were completely hung with underwater flora . at first this cave looked pitch - black to me . inside , the sun 's rays seemed to diminish by degrees . their hazy transparency was nothing more than drowned light .",44
"behind this eye was apparently a cabin containing the wheels of the rudder , and in which was stationed the helmsman , when he navigated the "" nautilus "" over the bed of the ocean , which the electric rays would evidently light up to a considerable distance .",39
"to the south the horizon , lighted by the first rays of the moon , was very clearly defined against the sky .",10
"having filled them with water and rendered their edges adhesive by means of a little clay , he thus fabricated a regular burning - glass , which , concentrating the solar rays on some very dry moss , soon caused it to blaze .",31
"i had risen half - an - hour before her entrance , and had washed my face , and put on my clothes by the light of a half - moon just setting , whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib .",35
"as for fish , they were numerous and often remarkable . here are the ones that the nautilus 's nets most frequently hauled on board : rays , including spotted rays that were oval in shape and brick red in color , their bodies strewn with erratic blue speckles and identifiable by their jagged double stings , silver - backed skates , common stingrays with stippled tails , butterfly rays that looked like huge two - meter cloaks flapping at middepth , toothless guitarfish that were a type of cartilaginous fish closer to the shark , trunkfish known as dromedaries that were one and a half feet long and had humps ending in backward - curving stings , serpentine moray eels with silver tails and bluish backs plus brown pectorals trimmed in gray piping , a species of butterfish called the fiatola decked out in thin gold stripes and the three colors of the french flag , montague blennies four decimeters long , superb jacks handsomely embellished by seven black crosswise streaks with blue and yellow fins plus gold and silver scales , snooks , standard mullet with yellow heads , parrotfish , wrasse , triggerfish , gobies , etc . , plus a thousand other fish common to the oceans we had already crossed .",30

"the candle , whose ray had been my beacon , burnt on the table ; and by its light an elderly woman , somewhat rough - looking , but scrupulously clean , like all about her , was knitting a stocking .",4
"my uncle took a few minutes to consider . for one short moment i felt a ray of hope , speedily to be extinguished . for he soon answered thus :",16
"vapor -- mist rather than clouds -- began to appear in the east , and assume all the prismatic colors under the influence of the solar rays .",26
"the transparency of salt water has long been recognized . its clarity is believed to exceed that of spring water . the mineral and organic substances it holds in suspension actually increase its translucency . in certain parts of the caribbean sea , you can see the sandy bottom with startling distinctness as deep as 145 meters down , and the penetrating power of the sun 's rays seems to give out only at a depth of 300 meters . but in this fluid setting traveled by the nautilus , our electric glow was being generated in the very heart of the waves . it was no longer illuminated water , it was liquid light .",67

"he went : i watched the light withdraw . he passed up the gallery very softly , unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible , shut it after him , and the last ray vanished . i was left in total darkness .",36
"there once more , through the panels opening into these caribbean waters ten meters below the surface of the waves , i found so many fascinating exhibits to describe in my daily notes ! among other zoophytes there were portuguese men - of - war known by the name physalia pelagica , like big , oblong bladders with a pearly sheen , spreading their membranes to the wind , letting their blue tentacles drift like silken threads ; to the eye delightful jellyfish , to the touch actual nettles that ooze a corrosive liquid . among the articulates there were annelid worms one and a half meters long , furnished with a pink proboscis , equipped with 1,700 organs of locomotion , snaking through the waters , and as they went , throwing off every gleam in the solar spectrum . from the fish branch there were manta rays , enormous cartilaginous fish ten feet long and weighing 600 pounds , their pectoral fin triangular , their midback slightly arched , their eyes attached to the edges of the face at the front of the head ; they floated like wreckage from a ship , sometimes fastening onto our windows like opaque shutters . there were american triggerfish for which nature has ground only black and white pigments , feather - shaped gobies that were long and plump with yellow fins and jutting jaws , sixteen - decimeter mackerel with short , sharp teeth , covered with small scales , and related to the albacore species . next came swarms of red mullet corseted in gold stripes from head to tail , their shining fins all aquiver , genuine masterpieces of jewelry , formerly sacred to the goddess diana , much in demand by rich romans , and about which the old saying goes : "" he who catches them does n't eat them ! "" finally , adorned with emerald ribbons and dressed in velvet and silk , golden angelfish passed before our eyes like courtiers in the paintings of veronese ; spurred gilthead stole by with their swift thoracic fins ; thread herring fifteen inches long were wrapped in their phosphorescent glimmers ; gray mullet thrashed the sea with their big fleshy tails ; red salmon seemed to mow the waves with their slicing pectorals ; and silver moonfish , worthy of their name , rose on the horizon of the waters like the whitish reflections of many moons .",148
"by april 20 we had risen to an average level of 1,500 meters . the nearest land was the island group of the bahamas , scattered like a batch of cobblestones over the surface of the water . there high underwater cliffs reared up , straight walls made of craggy chunks arranged like big stone foundations , among which there gaped black caves so deep our electric rays could n't light them to the far ends .",67
""" secundo , the selacians , with gills resembling those of the cyclostomes but whose lower jaw is free - moving . this order , which is the most important in the class , consists of two families . examples : the ray and the shark . """,42
"lastly , beyond and above the plateau , in a northwesterly direction and at a distance of at least seven miles , glittered a white summit which reflected the sun 's rays .",31
not a single ray of light from the moon pierced through the clouds .,3
"the canadian was not mistaken . cavorting around the nautilus was a school of triggerfish with flat bodies , grainy skins , armed with stings on their dorsal fins , and with four prickly rows of quills quivering on both sides of their tails . nothing could have been more wonderful than the skin covering them : white underneath , gray above , with spots of gold sparkling in the dark eddies of the waves . around them , rays were undulating like sheets flapping in the wind , and among these i spotted , much to my glee , a chinese ray , yellowish on its topside , a dainty pink on its belly , and armed with three stings behind its eyes ; a rare species whose very existence was still doubted in lacépède 's day , since that pioneering classifier of fish had seen one only in a portfolio of japanese drawings .",79

"the head of the "" bonadventure , "" which was a little to the south of the island , was set directly towards it , and as the sun mounted in the east , its rays fell upon one or two headlands .",35
"from eight to nine o'clock , the nautilus stayed a few meters beneath the waters . according to my calculations , we had to be quite close to suez . through the panels in the lounge , i spotted rocky bottoms brightly lit by our electric rays . it seemed to me that the strait was getting narrower and narrower .",46
"the horizon was beautifully clear , and the sea , undulating under a soft breeze , was as calm as the waters of a lake , sparkling here and there under the sun 's rays .",34
"the light from our apparatus , reflected from the small facets of quartz , shot sparkling rays at every angle , and i seemed to be moving through a diamond , within which the quickly darting rays broke across each other in a thousand flashing coruscations .",16
"as herbert had observed , great stormy clouds formed a lowering and heavy vault , preventing any star rays .",18
"indeed , larger blocks of ice soon appeared , their brilliance varying at the whim of the mists . some of these masses displayed green veins , as if scrawled with undulating lines of copper sulfate . others looked like enormous amethysts , letting the light penetrate their insides . the latter reflected the sun 's rays from the thousand facets of their crystals . the former , tinted with a bright limestone sheen , would have supplied enough building material to make a whole marble town .",56
"and in all honesty , i confess that this venturesome excursion was far from displeasing to me . i ca n't express the intensity of my amazement at the beauties of these new regions . the ice struck superb poses . here , its general effect suggested an oriental town with countless minarets and mosques . there , a city in ruins , flung to the ground by convulsions in the earth . these views were varied continuously by the sun 's oblique rays , or were completely swallowed up by gray mists in the middle of blizzards . then explosions , cave - ins , and great iceberg somersaults would occur all around us , altering the scenery like the changing landscape in a diorama .",83
"was it , i asked myself , a ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind ?",8
"possibly it might not yet be extinguished , but no ray escaped from the depths of the abyss in which reposed all that was mortal of captain nemo .",10
"we were walking on sand that was fine - grained and smooth , not wrinkled like beach sand , which preserves the impressions left by the waves . this dazzling carpet was a real mirror , throwing back the sun 's rays with startling intensity . the outcome : an immense vista of reflections that penetrated every liquid molecule . will anyone believe me if i assert that at this thirty - foot depth , i could see as if it was broad daylight ?",41
"for a quarter of an hour , i trod this blazing sand , which was strewn with tiny crumbs of seashell . looming like a long reef , the nautilus 's hull disappeared little by little , but when night fell in the midst of the waters , the ship 's beacon would surely facilitate our return on board , since its rays carried with perfect distinctness . this effect is difficult to understand for anyone who has never seen light beams so sharply defined on shore . there the dust that saturates the air gives such rays the appearance of a luminous fog ; but above water as well as underwater , shafts of electric light are transmitted with incomparable clarity .",97
"beyond the reef , the sea sparkled beneath the sun 's rays .",11
"we had been gone from the nautilus for about an hour and a half . it was almost noon . i spotted this fact in the perpendicularity of the sun 's rays , which were no longer refracted . the magic of these solar colors disappeared little by little , with emerald and sapphire shades vanishing from our surroundings altogether . we walked with steady steps that rang on the seafloor with astonishing intensity . the tiniest sounds were transmitted with a speed to which the ear is unaccustomed on shore . in fact , water is a better conductor of sound than air , and under the waves noises carry four times as fast .",31
"arriving at this 300-foot depth , i still detected the sun 's rays , but just barely . their intense brilliance had been followed by a reddish twilight , a midpoint between day and night . but we could see well enough to find our way , and it still was n't necessary to activate the ruhmkorff device .",12
"i say 150 meters , although i had no instruments for estimating this distance . but i knew that the sun 's rays , even in the clearest seas , could reach no deeper . so at precisely this point the darkness became profound . not a single object was visible past ten paces . consequently , i had begun to grope my way when suddenly i saw the glow of an intense white light . captain nemo had just activated his electric device . his companion did likewise . conseil and i followed suit . by turning a switch , i established contact between the induction coil and the glass spiral , and the sea , lit up by our four lanterns , was illuminated for a radius of twenty - five meters .",22
"and in truth , the ocean was deserted . not a sail on the horizon . the tips of crespo island had disappeared during the night . the sea , absorbing every color of the prism except its blue rays , reflected the latter in every direction and sported a wonderful indigo tint . the undulating waves regularly took on the appearance of watered silk with wide stripes .",39
"the nets were hauled on board . they were a breed of trawl resembling those used off the normandy coast , huge pouches held half open by a floating pole and a chain laced through the lower meshes . trailing in this way from these iron glove makers , the resulting receptacles scoured the ocean floor and collected every marine exhibit in their path . that day they gathered up some unusual specimens from these fish - filled waterways : anglerfish whose comical movements qualify them for the epithet "" clowns , "" black commerson anglers equipped with their antennas , undulating triggerfish encircled by little red bands , bloated puffers whose venom is extremely insidious , some olive - hued lampreys , snipefish covered with silver scales , cutlass fish whose electrocuting power equals that of the electric eel and the electric ray , scaly featherbacks with brown crosswise bands , greenish codfish , several varieties of goby , etc . ; finally , some fish of larger proportions : a one - meter jack with a prominent head , several fine bonito from the genus scomber decked out in the colors blue and silver , and three magnificent tuna whose high speeds could n't save them from our trawl .",143
"for part of the night , the novelty of our circumstances kept conseil and me at the lounge window . the sea was lit by our beacon 's electric rays . but the depths were deserted . fish did n't linger in these imprisoned waters . here they found merely a passageway for going from the antarctic ocean to open sea at the pole . our progress was swift . you could feel it in the vibrations of the long steel hull .",29
finally the ship 's rays appeared . their luminous trail guided us to the nautilus . by one o'clock we had returned .,4
"my eyes did n't leave the pressure gauge . we kept rising on a diagonal , going along this shiny surface that sparkled beneath our electric rays . above and below , the ice bank was subsiding in long gradients . mile after mile it was growing thinner .",26
"i saw mr . rochester smile:--his stern features softened ; his eye grew both brilliant and gentle , its ray both searching and sweet .",19
what a strange light inspired them ! what an extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me ! how the new feeling bore me up !,12
"while he took his sights with his sextant , one of the nautilus 's sailors-- that muscular man who had gone with us to crespo island during our first underwater excursion -- came up to clean the glass panes of the beacon . i then examined the fittings of this mechanism , whose power was increased a hundredfold by biconvex lenses that were designed like those in a lighthouse and kept its rays productively focused . this electric lamp was so constructed as to yield its maximum illuminating power . in essence , its light was generated in a vacuum , insuring both its steadiness and intensity . such a vacuum also reduced wear on the graphite points between which the luminous arc expanded . this was an important savings for captain nemo , who could n't easily renew them . but under these conditions , wear and tear were almost nonexistent .",72
"the ceiling lights in the lounge then went out , the panels opened , and through the windows i saw , for a half - mile radius , the sea brightly lit by the beacon 's rays .",36
"they could not be mistaken in the nature of the irradiation thrown from the glowing nucleus , whose clear rays were shattered by all the angles , all the projections of the cavern .",19
"in the midst of the watery mass , brightly lit by our electric beams , there snaked past those one - meter lampreys that are common to nearly every clime . a type of ray from the genus oxyrhynchus , five feet wide , had a white belly with a spotted , ash - gray back and was carried along by the currents like a huge , wide - open shawl . other rays passed by so quickly i could n't tell if they deserved that name "" eagle ray "" coined by the ancient greeks , or those designations of "" rat ray , "" "" bat ray , "" and "" toad ray "" that modern fishermen have inflicted on them . dogfish known as topes , twelve feet long and especially feared by divers , were racing with each other . looking like big bluish shadows , thresher sharks went by , eight feet long and gifted with an extremely acute sense of smell . dorados from the genus sparus , some measuring up to thirteen decimeters , appeared in silver and azure costumes encircled with ribbons , which contrasted with the dark color of their fins ; fish sacred to the goddess venus , their eyes set in brows of gold ; a valuable species that patronizes all waters fresh or salt , equally at home in rivers , lakes , and oceans , living in every clime , tolerating any temperature , their line dating back to prehistoric times on this earth yet preserving all its beauty from those far - off days . magnificent sturgeons , nine to ten meters long and extremely fast , banged their powerful tails against the glass of our panels , showing bluish backs with small brown spots ; they resemble sharks , without equaling their strength , and are encountered in every sea ; in the spring they delight in swimming up the great rivers , fighting the currents of the volga , danube , po , rhine , loire , and oder , while feeding on herring , mackerel , salmon , and codfish ; although they belong to the class of cartilaginous fish , they rate as a delicacy ; they 're eaten fresh , dried , marinated , or salt - preserved , and in olden times they were borne in triumph to the table of the roman epicure lucullus . but whenever the nautilus drew near the surface , those denizens of the mediterranean i could observe most productively belonged to the sixty - third genus of bony fish . these were tuna from the genus scomber , blue - black on top , silver on the belly armor , their dorsal stripes giving off a golden gleam . they are said to follow ships in search of refreshing shade from the hot tropical sun , and they did just that with the nautilus , as they had once done with the vessels of the count de la pérouse . for long hours they competed in speed with our submersible . i could n't stop marveling at these animals so perfectly cut out for racing , their heads small , their bodies sleek , spindle - shaped , and in some cases over three meters long , their pectoral fins gifted with remarkable strength , their caudal fins forked . like certain flocks of birds , whose speed they equal , these tuna swim in triangle formation , which prompted the ancients to say they 'd boned up on geometry and military strategy . and yet they ca n't escape the provençal fishermen , who prize them as highly as did the ancient inhabitants of turkey and italy ; and these valuable animals , as oblivious as if they were deaf and blind , leap right into the marseilles tuna nets and perish by the thousands .",34
