"she wept abundantly ; and -- let us speak it to the praise of m. d’artagnan the younger -- notwithstanding the efforts he made to remain firm , as a future musketeer ought , nature prevailed , and he shed many tears , of which he succeeded with great difficulty in concealing the half .",21
"as for captain nemo , i wondered what he would make of our escaping , what concern or perhaps what distress it might cause him , and what he would do in the twofold event of our attempt either failing or being found out ! certainly i had no complaints to register with him , on the contrary . never was hospitality more wholehearted than his . yet in leaving him i could n't be accused of ingratitude . no solemn promises bound us to him . in order to keep us captive , he had counted only on the force of circumstances and not on our word of honor . but his avowed intention to imprison us forever on his ship justified our every effort .",125

"under my eyes i had the excellent charts of the torres strait that had been surveyed and drawn up by the hydrographic engineer vincendon dumoulin and sublieutenant ( now admiral ) coupvent - desbois , who were part of dumont d'urville 's general staff during his final voyage to circumnavigate the globe . these , along with the efforts of captain king , are the best charts for untangling the snarl of this narrow passageway , and i consulted them with scrupulous care . around the nautilus the sea was boiling furiously . a stream of waves , bearing from southeast to northwest at a speed of two and a half miles per hour , broke over heads of coral emerging here and there .",58

"athos , who was very expert in all bodily exercises , passed with d’artagnan to the opposite side and challenged them ; but at the first effort he made , although he played with his left hand , he found that his wound was yet too recent to allow of such exertion .",26
