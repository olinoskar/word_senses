""" yes ! "" replied the engineer quickly , "" yes , even if i have to penetrate into the bowels of this island ! """,17
"captain nemo fixed his penetrating gaze upon the engineer , as though he were about to annihilate him .",4
"this commissary was a man of very repulsive mien , with a pointed nose , with yellow and salient cheek bones , with eyes small but keen and penetrating , and an expression of countenance resembling at once the polecat and the fox .",28
"according to him , a cavity , more or less considerable , must exist in the mass of granite which supported prospect heights , and he intended to penetrate into it .",28
"suddenly i let out a yell . there had been a collision , but it was comparatively mild . i could feel the penetrating force of the steel spur . i could hear scratchings and scrapings . carried away with its driving power , the nautilus had passed through the vessel 's mass like a sailmaker 's needle through canvas !",23
"he sat all night on his stool , starting at the least noise ; and when the first rays of the sun penetrated into his chamber , the dawn itself appeared to him to have taken funereal tints .",22
"i listened , i watched in the darkness for an answer , a cry , a mere breath of sound , but nothing came . some minutes passed . a whole world of ideas had opened in my mind . i thought that my weakened voice could never penetrate to my companions .",48
"she broke forth as never moon yet burst from cloud : a hand first penetrated the sable folds and waved them away ; then , not a moon , but a white human form shone in the azure , inclining a glorious brow earthward .",14
"the poor fowl was thin , and covered with one of those thick , bristly skins through which the teeth can not penetrate with all their efforts . the fowl must have been sought for a long time on the perch , to which it had retired to die of old age .",22
"when neb heard that his master had been made prisoner , he left massachusetts without hesitating an instant , arrived before richmond , and by dint of stratagem and shrewdness , after having risked his life twenty times over , managed to penetrate into the besieged town .",42
"the engineer did not neglect either to speak aloud , so as to penetrate at the same time by the organs of hearing and sight the depths of that torpid intelligence .",13
"cyrus harding evidently could not resist fifty ruffians , all well armed , who , either by penetrating by main force into granite house , or by starving out the besieged , could obtain from them what they wanted .",17
"the colonists even visited dark tunnels , dating from the volcanic period , still black from the passage of the fire , and penetrated into the depths of the mountain .",23
"but after having with a penetrating eye observed the open face of the sailor , he was convinced that he had before him an honest man .",5
"in essence , i was already familiar with the whole forward part of this underwater boat , and here are its exact subdivisions going from amidships to its spur : the dining room , 5 meters long and separated from the library by a watertight bulkhead , in other words , it could n't be penetrated by the sea ; the library , 5 meters long ; the main lounge , 10 meters long , separated from the captain 's stateroom by a second watertight bulkhead ; the aforesaid stateroom , 5 meters long ; mine , 2.5 meters long ; and finally , air tanks 7.5 meters long and extending to the stempost . total : a length of 35 meters . doors were cut into the watertight bulkheads and were shut hermetically by means of india - rubber seals , which insured complete safety aboard the nautilus in the event of a leak in any one section .",55
""" yes , ned , i repeat it with a conviction backed by factual logic . i believe in the existence of a mammal with a powerful constitution , belonging to the vertebrate branch like baleen whales , sperm whales , or dolphins , and armed with a tusk made of horn that has tremendous penetrating power . """,55
"arrived at the spot on which grew the first beautiful trees of the forest , their foliage slightly agitated by the breeze , the stranger appeared greedily to drink in the penetrating odor which filled the atmosphere , and a long sigh escaped from his chest .",31
""" yes , i see , "" ned replied , growing more interested . "" because the water surrounds me but does n't penetrate me . """,23
""" well , "" he said , after some minutes ' silence , "" it is strange ; but that sentence has penetrated my breast painfully .",22
"here , bridges were thrown from one rock to another ; there , arches like those of a wave , into the depths of which the eye could not penetrate ; in one place , large vaulted excavations presented a monumental aspect ; in another , a crowd of columns , spires , and arches , such as no gothic cathedral ever possessed .",29
"and he was right . imagine the large development attained by these plants , which prefer a warm , moist climate . i knew that the _ lycopodon giganteum _ attains , according to bulliard , a circumference of eight or nine feet ; but here were pale mushrooms , thirty to forty feet high , and crowned with a cap of equal diameter . there they stood in thousands . no light could penetrate between their huge cones , and complete darkness reigned beneath those giants ; they formed settlements of domes placed in close array like the round , thatched roofs of a central african city .",74
"soon lurid lights began to penetrate the vertical gallery which widened as we went up . right and left i could see deep channels , like huge tunnels , out of which escaped dense volumes of smoke ; tongues of fire lapped the walls , which crackled and sputtered under the intense heat .",5
"in consequence and in view of these future establishments , it became of much importance that they should penetrate into all the yet unknown parts of lincoln island , that is to say , through that thick forest which extended on the right bank of the mercy , from its mouth to the extremity of the serpentine peninsula , as well as on the whole of its western side .",18
""" it seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and lead him to say something unguarded . the boots volunteered to show me the room : it was on the second floor , and there was a small corridor leading up to it . the boots pointed out the door to me , and was about to go downstairs again when i saw something that made me feel sickish , in spite of my twenty years ' experience . from under the door there curled a little red ribbon of blood , which had meandered across the passage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side . i gave a cry , which brought the boots back . he nearly fainted when he saw it . the door was locked on the inside , but we put our shoulders to it , and knocked it in . the window of the room was open , and beside the window , all huddled up , lay the body of a man in his nightdress . he was quite dead , and had been for some time , for his limbs were rigid and cold . when we turned him over , the boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of joseph stangerson . the cause of death was a deep stab in the left side , which must have penetrated the heart . and now comes the strangest part of the affair . what do you suppose was above the murdered man ? """,247
"the iron door leading on deck was then securely fastened in such a manner as to prevent even a drop of water from penetrating to the interior of the "" nautilus . """,23
"he had , at least , one resource,--to call on the french and english consuls at yokohama for assistance . but he shrank from telling the story of his adventures , intimately connected as it was with that of his master ; and , before doing so , he determined to exhaust all other means of aid . as chance did not favour him in the european quarter , he penetrated that inhabited by the native japanese , determined , if necessary , to push on to yeddo .",70
"sometimes when the cardinal , always on horseback , like the lowest gendarme of the army , cast a pensive glance over those works , so slowly keeping pace with his wishes , which the engineers , brought from all the corners of france , were executing under his orders , if he met a musketeer of the company of treville , he drew near and looked at him in a peculiar manner , and not recognizing in him one of our four companions , he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in another direction .",88
"towards five o'clock in the morning of the 25th of march , the sky began to lighten ; the horizon still remained dark , but with daybreak a thick mist rose from the sea , so that the eye could scarcely penetrate beyond twenty feet or so from where they stood .",41
"the transparency of salt water has long been recognized . its clarity is believed to exceed that of spring water . the mineral and organic substances it holds in suspension actually increase its translucency . in certain parts of the caribbean sea , you can see the sandy bottom with startling distinctness as deep as 145 meters down , and the penetrating power of the sun 's rays seems to give out only at a depth of 300 meters . but in this fluid setting traveled by the nautilus , our electric glow was being generated in the very heart of the waves . it was no longer illuminated water , it was liquid light .",61
""" quite a mistake , "" my uncle answered . "" the earth has been heated by combustion on its surface , that is all . its surface was composed of a great number of metals , such as potassium and sodium , which have the peculiar property of igniting at the mere contact with air and water ; these metals kindled when the atmospheric vapours fell in rain upon the soil ; and by and by , when the waters penetrated into the fissures of the crust of the earth , they broke out into fresh combustion with explosions and eruptions . such was the cause of the numerous volcanoes at the origin of the earth . """,81
"the stronger among the girls ran about and engaged in active games , but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for shelter and warmth in the verandah ; and amongst these , as the dense mist penetrated to their shivering frames , i heard frequently the sound of a hollow cough .",37
"this cavern was about a hundred feet wide and a hundred and fifty in height . a large mass had been rent asunder by a subterranean disturbance . yielding to some vast power from below it had broken asunder , leaving this great hollow into which human beings were now penetrating for the first time .",50
"we had been wandering , indeed , in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning ; but since dinner ( mrs . reed , when there was no company , dined early ) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre , and a rain so penetrating , that further out - door exercise was now out of the question .",50
"i mounted to my chamber ; locked myself in ; fell on my knees ; and prayed in my way -- a different way to st . john 's , but effective in its own fashion . i seemed to penetrate very near a mighty spirit ; and my soul rushed out in gratitude at his feet .",40
"god doubtless neither heard nor saw me , and i sank upon the floor a prey to a slumber which resembled death . "" of all that passed in that sleep , or the time which glided away while it lasted , i have no remembrance . the only thing i recollect is that i awoke in bed in a round chamber , the furniture of which was sumptuous , and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the ceiling . no door gave entrance to the room . it might be called a magnificent prison .",75
"it was not enough to reach the walls ; an opening in them must be accomplished , and to attain this purpose the party only had their pocket - knives . happily the temple walls were built of brick and wood , which could be penetrated with little difficulty ; after one brick had been taken out , the rest would yield easily .",45
"indeed , larger blocks of ice soon appeared , their brilliance varying at the whim of the mists . some of these masses displayed green veins , as if scrawled with undulating lines of copper sulfate . others looked like enormous amethysts , letting the light penetrate their insides . the latter reflected the sun 's rays from the thousand facets of their crystals . the former , tinted with a bright limestone sheen , would have supplied enough building material to make a whole marble town .",46
"the weather -- if we may use that term -- will change before long . the atmosphere is charged with vapours , pervaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of saline waters . the clouds are sinking lower , and assume an olive hue . the electric light can scarcely penetrate through the dense curtain which has dropped over the theatre on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged .",51
"was it , i asked myself , a ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind ?",12
"ned land observed the sea with his penetrating eyes . it was deserted . the canadian sighted nothing new on the horizon , neither sail nor shore . a breeze was blowing noisily from the west , and disheveled by the wind , long billows made the submersible roll very noticeably .",7
"the pick had soon penetrated two feet into the granite partition , and our man had worked for above an hour . i was in an agony of impatience . my uncle wanted to employ stronger measures , and i had some difficulty in dissuading him ; still he had just taken a pickaxe in his hand , when a sudden hissing was heard , and a jet of water spurted out with violence against the opposite wall .",4
""" i understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a gate ? """,8
""" at length i saw the lamp rise softly , and disappear in the depths of the ceiling ; my chamber was filled with darkness and obscurity , but i made a strong effort to penetrate this darkness and obscurity .",35
"on the 6th and 7th of july we kept following the spiral curves of this singular well , penetrating in actual distance no more than two leagues ; but being carried to a depth of five leagues below the level of the sea . but on the 8th , about noon , the fault took , towards the south - east , a much gentler slope , one of about forty - five degrees .",18
"i have no hope of penetrating , sword in hand , to paris , i know that well . but this war may bring round a peace ; this peace will require a negotiator ; that negotiator will be me .",5
"not a sound could penetrate into it , even the thunder peals could not pierce its thick sides .",4
"he was talking , at the moment , to louisa and amy eshton . i wondered to see them receive with calm that look which seemed to me so penetrating : i expected their eyes to fall , their colour to rise under it ; yet i was glad when i found they were in no sense moved .",29
"i had now swallowed my tea . i was mightily refreshed by the beverage ; as much so as a giant with wine : it gave new tone to my unstrung nerves , and enabled me to address this penetrating young judge steadily .",39
"the sioux had at the same time invaded the cars , skipping like enraged monkeys over the roofs , thrusting open the doors , and fighting hand to hand with the passengers . penetrating the baggage - car , they pillaged it , throwing the trunks out of the train . the cries and shots were constant . the travellers defended themselves bravely ; some of the cars were barricaded , and sustained a siege , like moving forts , carried along at a speed of a hundred miles an hour .",33
this was in reality the only way by which to penetrate into granite house so as to fight with and drive out the intruders .,10
"the abbess , who was the daughter of a noble house , took particular delight in stories of the court , which so seldom travel to the extremities of the kingdom , and which , above all , have so much difficulty in penetrating the walls of convents , at whose threshold the noise of the world dies away .",43
