"_ nov . _ 5.—this day went abroad with my gun and my dog , and killed a wild cat ; her skin pretty soft , but her flesh good for nothing ; every creature that i killed i took of the skins and preserved them . coming back by the sea - shore , i saw many sorts of sea - fowls , which i did not understand ; but was surprised , and almost frightened , with two or three seals , which , while i was gazing at , not well knowing what they were , got into the sea , and escaped me for that time .",18
"in the deep shade , at the farther end of the room , a figure ran backwards and forwards . what it was , whether beast or human being , one could not , at first sight , tell : it grovelled , seemingly , on all fours ; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal : but it was covered with clothing , and a quantity of dark , grizzled hair , wild as a mane , hid its head and face .",56

"a group of old fakirs were capering and making a wild ado round the statue ; these were striped with ochre , and covered with cuts whence their blood issued drop by drop -- stupid fanatics , who , in the great indian ceremonies , still throw themselves under the wheels of juggernaut . some brahmins , clad in all the sumptuousness of oriental apparel , and leading a woman who faltered at every step , followed . this woman was young , and as fair as a european . her head and neck , shoulders , ears , arms , hands , and toes were loaded down with jewels and gems with bracelets , earrings , and rings ; while a tunic bordered with gold , and covered with a light muslin robe , betrayed the outline of her form .",10

"although the young man was brave , as we know , he was terrified at that wild countenance , those terribly dilated pupils , those pale cheeks , and those bleeding lips . he recoiled to the other side of the room as he would have done from a serpent which was crawling toward him , and his sword coming in contact with his nervous hand , he drew it almost unconsciously from the scabbard .",16

"new york and san francisco are thus united by an uninterrupted metal ribbon , which measures no less than three thousand seven hundred and eighty - six miles . between omaha and the pacific the railway crosses a territory which is still infested by indians and wild beasts , and a large tract which the mormons , after they were driven from illinois in 1845 , began to colonise .",46

"if the engineer had had only to deal with wild beasts , jaguars or others , he would have simply lighted fires all around his camp , which would have sufficed for its defense ; but the convicts would be rather attracted than terrified by the flames , and it was , therefore , better to be surrounded by the profound darkness of night .",9
"amidst all this , i had to listen as well as watch : to listen for the movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den . but since mr . rochester 's visit it seemed spellbound : all the night i heard but three sounds at three long intervals,--a step creak , a momentary renewal of the snarling , canine noise , and a deep human groan .",20
"here again i paused abruptly , and now with a feeling of wild amazement — for there could be no doubt whatever that , in this instance , i did actually hear ( although from what direction it proceeded i found it impossible to say ) a low and apparently distant , but harsh , protracted , and most unusual screaming or grating sound — the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon ’s unnatural shriek as described by the romancer .",12
"this homeric slaughter dragged on for an hour , and the long - skulled predators could n't get away . several times ten or twelve of them teamed up , trying to crush the nautilus with their sheer mass . through the windows you could see their enormous mouths paved with teeth , their fearsome eyes . losing all self - control , ned land hurled threats and insults at them . you could feel them clinging to the submersible like hounds atop a wild boar in the underbrush . but by forcing the pace of its propeller , the nautilus carried them off , dragged them under , or brought them back to the upper level of the waters , untroubled by their enormous weight or their powerful grip .",84
"i had , again and again , held the water to mason 's white lips ; again and again offered him the stimulating salts : my efforts seemed ineffectual : either bodily or mental suffering , or loss of blood , or all three combined , were fast prostrating his strength . he moaned so , and looked so weak , wild , and lost , i feared he was dying ; and i might not even speak to him .",61
"and if nothing happens without his knowledge , he knows that i am here , and am in this dreadful condition ; and if nothing happens without his appointment , he has appointed all this to befall me . nothing occurred to my thought to contradict any of these conclusions , and therefore it rested upon me with the greater force , that it must needs be that god had appointed all this to befall me ; that i was brought into this miserable circumstance by his direction , he having the sole power , not of me only , but of everything that happened in the world . immediately it followed : why has god done this to me ? what have i done to be thus used ? my conscience presently checked me in that inquiry , as if i had blasphemed , and methought it spoke to me like a voice : “ wretch ! dost _ thou _ ask what thou hast done ? look back upon a dreadful misspent life , and ask thyself what thou hast _ not _ done ? ask , why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed ? why wert thou not drowned in yarmouth roads ; killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the sallee man - of - war ; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of africa ; or drowned _ here _ , when all the crew perished but thyself ? dost _ thou _ ask , what have i done ? ” i was struck dumb with these reflections , as one astonished , and had not a word to say — no , not to answer to myself , but rose up pensive and sad , walked back to my retreat , and went up over my wall , as if i had been going to bed ; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed , and i had no inclination to sleep ; so i sat down in my chair , and lighted my lamp , for it began to be dark . now , as the apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me very much , it occurred to my thought that the brazilians take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers , and i had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests , which was quite cured , and some also that was green , and not quite cured .",230

"it was all very well to say ' drink me , ' but the wise little alice was not going to do that in a hurry . ' no , i 'll look first , ' she said , ' and see whether it 's marked "" poison "" or not ' ; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt , and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things , all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them : such as , that a red - hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long ; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife , it usually bleeds ; and she had never forgotten that , if you drink much from a bottle marked ' poison , ' it is almost certain to disagree with you , sooner or later .",72

""" it was nearer one than twelve , and a wild , bleak night , blowing hard and raining in torrents . dismal as it was outside , i was glad within — so glad that i could have shouted out from pure exultation . if any of you gentlemen have ever pined for a thing , and longed for it during twenty long years , and then suddenly found it within your reach , you would understand my feelings . i lit a cigar , and puffed at it to steady my nerves , but my hands were trembling , and my temples throbbing with excitement . as i drove , i could see old john ferrier and sweet lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me , just as plain as i see you all in this room . all the way they were ahead of me , one on each side of the horse until i pulled up at the house in the brixton road .",10
