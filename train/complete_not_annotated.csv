"on the 15th our preparations were all made . our host gave the professor very great pleasure by presenting him with a map of iceland far more complete than that of hendersen . it was the map of m. olaf nikolas olsen , in the proportion of 1 to 480,000 of the actual size of the island , and published by the icelandic literary society . it was a precious document for a mineralogist .",27

"fix did not look at the state of things in the same light . the storm greatly pleased him . his satisfaction would have been complete had the rangoon been forced to retreat before the violence of wind and waves . each delay filled him with hope , for it became more and more probable that fogg would be obliged to remain some days at hong kong ; and now the heavens themselves became his allies , with the gusts and squalls . it mattered not that they made him sea - sick -- he made no account of this inconvenience ; and , whilst his body was writhing under their effects , his spirit bounded with hopeful exultation .",25

"a practiced workman can make , without a machine , about ten thousand bricks in twelve hours ; but in their two days work the five brickmakers on lincoln island had not made more than three thousand , which were ranged near each other , until the time when their complete desiccation would permit them to be used in building the oven , that is to say , in three or four days .",50

"in essence , i was already familiar with the whole forward part of this underwater boat , and here are its exact subdivisions going from amidships to its spur : the dining room , 5 meters long and separated from the library by a watertight bulkhead , in other words , it could n't be penetrated by the sea ; the library , 5 meters long ; the main lounge , 10 meters long , separated from the captain 's stateroom by a second watertight bulkhead ; the aforesaid stateroom , 5 meters long ; mine , 2.5 meters long ; and finally , air tanks 7.5 meters long and extending to the stempost . total : a length of 35 meters . doors were cut into the watertight bulkheads and were shut hermetically by means of india - rubber seals , which insured complete safety aboard the nautilus in the event of a leak in any one section .",144

"not one of the former colonists of lincoln island was absent , for they had sworn to live always together . neb was with his master ; ayrton was there ready to sacrifice himself for all ; pencroft was more a farmer than he had ever been a sailor ; herbert , who completed his studies under the superintendence of cyrus harding , and gideon spilett , who founded the new lincoln herald , the best - informed journal in the world .",53
"so we returned through the forest , and we completed our harvest by making a clean sweep of some palm cabbages that had to be picked from the crowns of their trees , some small beans that i recognized as the "" abrou "" of the malaysians , and some high - quality yams .",9

"and he was right . imagine the large development attained by these plants , which prefer a warm , moist climate . i knew that the _ lycopodon giganteum _ attains , according to bulliard , a circumference of eight or nine feet ; but here were pale mushrooms , thirty to forty feet high , and crowned with a cap of equal diameter . there they stood in thousands . no light could penetrate between their huge cones , and complete darkness reigned beneath those giants ; they formed settlements of domes placed in close array like the round , thatched roofs of a central african city .",81

"this bird belonged to the finest of the eight species credited to papua and its neighboring islands . it was a "" great emerald , "" one of the rarest birds of paradise . it measured three decimeters long . its head was comparatively small , and its eyes , placed near the opening of its beak , were also small . but it offered a wonderful mixture of hues : a yellow beak , brown feet and claws , hazel wings with purple tips , pale yellow head and scruff of the neck , emerald throat , the belly and chest maroon to brown . two strands , made of a horn substance covered with down , rose over its tail , which was lengthened by long , very light feathers of wonderful fineness , and they completed the costume of this marvelous bird that the islanders have poetically named "" the sun bird .

"i had no reply to this , and i feared that captain nemo would n't take us homeward but rather into that huge ocean washing the shores of both asia and america . in this way he would complete his underwater tour of the world , going back to those seas where the nautilus enjoyed the greatest freedom . but if we returned to the pacific , far from every populated shore , what would happen to ned land 's plans ?",38

"while i was observing this phenomenal creature , two jets of steam and water sprang from its blowholes and rose to an altitude of forty meters , which settled for me its mode of breathing . from this i finally concluded that it belonged to the branch vertebrata , class mammalia , subclass monodelphia , group pisciforma , order cetacea , family . . . but here i could n't make up my mind . the order cetacea consists of three families , baleen whales , sperm whales , dolphins , and it 's in this last group that narwhales are placed . each of these families is divided into several genera , each genus into species , each species into varieties . so i was still missing variety , species , genus , and family , but no doubt i would complete my classifying with the aid of heaven and commander farragut .",142

"in the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the sierra blanco . as far as the eye can reach stretches the great flat plain - land , all dusted over with patches of alkali , and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes . on the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks , with their rugged summits flecked with snow . in this great stretch of country there is no sign of life , nor of anything appertaining to life . there is no bird in the steel - blue heaven , no movement upon the dull , grey earth — above all , there is absolute silence . listen as one may , there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness ; nothing but silence — complete and heart - subduing silence . it has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain . that is hardly true . looking down from the sierra blanco , one sees a pathway traced out across the desert , which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance . it is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers . here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun , and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali . approach , and examine them ! they are bones : some large and coarse , others smaller and more delicate . the former have belonged to oxen , and the latter to men . for fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside .",148
"this was the only voyage which i may say was successful in all my adventures , which i owe to the integrity and honesty of my friend the captain ; under whom also i got a competent knowledge of the mathematics and the rules of navigation , learned how to keep an account of the ship ’s course , take an observation , and , in short , to understand some things that were needful to be understood by a sailor ; for , as he took delight to instruct me , i took delight to learn ; and , in a word , this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant ; for i brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold - dust for my adventure , which yielded me in london , at my return , almost £ 300 ; and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts which have since so completed my ruin .",157
