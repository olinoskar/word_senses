""" i understand , captain , i understand your delight at strolling in the midst of this wealth . you 're a man who gathers his treasure in person . no museum in europe owns such a collection of exhibits from the ocean . but if i exhaust all my wonderment on them , i 'll have nothing left for the ship that carries them ! i have absolutely no wish to probe those secrets of yours ! but i confess that my curiosity is aroused to the limit by this nautilus , the motor power it contains , the equipment enabling it to operate , the ultra powerful force that brings it to life . i see some instruments hanging on the walls of this lounge whose purposes are unknown to me . may i learn-- """,126
"then the panels in the lounge closed . we kept our hands over our eyes , which were utterly saturated with those concentric gleams that swirl before the retina when sunlight strikes it too intensely . it took some time to calm our troubled vision .",5
"how many delightful hours i spent in this way at the lounge window ! how many new specimens of underwater flora and fauna i marveled at beneath the light of our electric beacon ! mushroom - shaped fungus coral , some slate - colored sea anemone including the species thalassianthus aster among others , organ - pipe coral arranged like flutes and just begging for a puff from the god pan , shells unique to this sea that dwell in madreporic cavities and whose bases are twisted into squat spirals , and finally a thousand samples of a polypary i had n't observed until then : the common sponge .",11
"before i had time to express the surprise this new proposition caused me , a camera was carried into the lounge at captain nemo 's request . the liquid setting , electrically lit , unfolded with perfect clarity through the wide - open panels . no shadows , no blurs , thanks to our artificial light . not even sunshine could have been better for our purposes . with the thrust of its propeller curbed by the slant of its fins , the nautilus stood still . the camera was aimed at the scenery on the ocean floor , and in a few seconds we had a perfect negative .",20
the entire day passed without my being honored by a visit from captain nemo . the panels in the lounge did n't open . perhaps they did n't want us to get tired of these beautiful things .,19
"it was a squid of colossal dimensions , fully eight meters long . it was traveling backward with tremendous speed in the same direction as the nautilus . it gazed with enormous , staring eyes that were tinted sea green . its eight arms ( or more accurately , feet ) were rooted in its head , which has earned these animals the name cephalopod ; its arms stretched a distance twice the length of its body and were writhing like the serpentine hair of the furies . you could plainly see its 250 suckers , arranged over the inner sides of its tentacles and shaped like semispheric capsules . sometimes these suckers fastened onto the lounge window by creating vacuums against it . the monster 's mouth -- a beak made of horn and shaped like that of a parrot -- opened and closed vertically . its tongue , also of horn substance and armed with several rows of sharp teeth , would flicker out from between these genuine shears . what a freak of nature ! a bird 's beak on a mollusk ! its body was spindle - shaped and swollen in the middle , a fleshy mass that must have weighed 20,000 to 25,000 kilograms . its unstable color would change with tremendous speed as the animal grew irritated , passing successively from bluish gray to reddish brown .",116
"for several hours the nautilus drifted in this brilliant tide , and our wonderment grew when we saw huge marine animals cavorting in it , like the fire - dwelling salamanders of myth . in the midst of these flames that did n't burn , i could see swift , elegant porpoises , the tireless pranksters of the seas , and sailfish three meters long , those shrewd heralds of hurricanes , whose fearsome broadswords sometimes banged against the lounge window . then smaller fish appeared : miscellaneous triggerfish , leather jacks , unicornfish , and a hundred others that left stripes on this luminous atmosphere in their course .",79
""" then , sir , with your permission , i 'll bid you good evening . "" and with that , captain nemo left the lounge .",25
"for part of the night , the novelty of our circumstances kept conseil and me at the lounge window . the sea was lit by our beacon 's electric rays . but the depths were deserted . fish did n't linger in these imprisoned waters . here they found merely a passageway for going from the antarctic ocean to open sea at the pole . our progress was swift . you could feel it in the vibrations of the long steel hull .",17
"during that day a fearsome school of sharks provided us with an escort . dreadful animals that teem in these seas and make them extremely dangerous . there were port jackson sharks with a brown back , a whitish belly , and eleven rows of teeth , bigeye sharks with necks marked by a large black spot encircled in white and resembling an eye , and isabella sharks whose rounded snouts were strewn with dark speckles . often these powerful animals rushed at the lounge window with a violence less than comforting . by this point ned land had lost all self - control . he wanted to rise to the surface of the waves and harpoon the monsters , especially certain smooth - hound sharks whose mouths were paved with teeth arranged like a mosaic , and some big five - meter tiger sharks that insisted on personally provoking him . but the nautilus soon picked up speed and easily left astern the fastest of these man - eaters .",84
