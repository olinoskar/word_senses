"and so it turned out . the nautilus took full advantage of this countercurrent . it advanced swiftly through this narrow passageway . for an instant i could glimpse the wonderful ruins of the temple of hercules , buried undersea , as pliny and avianus have mentioned , together with the flat island they stand on ; and a few minutes later , we were floating on the waves of the atlantic .",20
"after clearing the outer belt of rocks via a narrow passageway , the nautilus lay inside the breakers where the sea had a depth of thirty to forty fathoms . under the green shade of some tropical evergreens , i spotted a few savages who looked extremely startled at our approach . in this long , blackish object advancing flush with the water , did n't they see some fearsome cetacean that they were obliged to view with distrust ?",9
"yet i decided to return to the nautilus . we went along a steep , narrow path that ran over the cliff 's summit . by 11:30 we had arrived at our landing place . the beached skiff had brought the captain ashore . i spotted him standing on a chunk of basalt . his instruments were beside him . his eyes were focused on the northern horizon , along which the sun was sweeping in its extended arc .",15
"there our horses were baited ; then taking the narrow path to left between a chain of hills and the sea , they carried us to our next stage , the aolkirkja of brantär and one mile farther on , to saurboër ' annexia , ' a chapel of ease built on the south shore of the hvalfiord .",9
""" i believe you will accept the post i offer you , "" said he , "" and hold it for a while : not permanently , though : any more than i could permanently keep the narrow and narrowing -- the tranquil , hidden office of english country incumbent ; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to repose as that in mine , though of a different kind .

""",39
"we had to cross a few narrow fiords , and at last quite a wide gulf ; the tide , then high , allowed us to pass over without delay , and to reach the hamlet of alftanes , one mile beyond .",6
"under my eyes i had the excellent charts of the torres strait that had been surveyed and drawn up by the hydrographic engineer vincendon dumoulin and sublieutenant ( now admiral ) coupvent - desbois , who were part of dumont d'urville 's general staff during his final voyage to circumnavigate the globe . these , along with the efforts of captain king , are the best charts for untangling the snarl of this narrow passageway , and i consulted them with scrupulous care . around the nautilus the sea was boiling furiously . a stream of waves , bearing from southeast to northwest at a speed of two and a half miles per hour , broke over heads of coral emerging here and there .",73
"this conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by - ways . in the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand . "" that 's audley court in there , "" he said , pointing to a narrow slit in the line of dead - coloured brick . "" you 'll find me here when you come back . """,55
"audley court was not an attractive locality . the narrow passage led us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings . we picked our way among groups of dirty children , and through lines of discoloured linen , until we came to number 46 , the door of which was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name rance was engraved . on enquiry we found that the constable was in bed , and we were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming .",9
"i was already wondering if captain nemo , rash to the point of sheer insanity , wanted his ship to tackle the narrows where dumont d'urville 's two sloops of war had gone aground , when he changed direction a second time and cut straight to the west , heading toward gueboroa island .",22
i sat down in despair . my uncle strode from side to side in the narrow passage .,15
"if the direction has been maintained from the northeast to the southwest , we have traversed the states of north carolina , of south carolina , of georgia , the gulf of mexico , mexico , itself , in its narrow part , then a part of the pacific ocean .",40
all that could now be seen of lincoln island was the narrow rock which now served as a refuge to the six colonists and their dog top .,11
"we walked in single file , headed by the hunter , who ascended by narrow tracks , where two could not have gone abreast . there was therefore no room for conversation .",14
"the escort of boats and tenders still followed the frigate and only left us when we came abreast of the lightship , whose two signal lights mark the entrance of the narrows to upper new york bay .",31
"the whole of the valley bordering on the cave , shaded by fir and other trees , was thoroughly explored , and on turning the point of the southwestern spur , the colonists entered a narrower gorge similar to the picturesque columns of basalt on the coast .",35
"as i said , commander farragut had carefully equipped his ship with all the gear needed to fish for a gigantic cetacean . no whaling vessel could have been better armed . we had every known mechanism , from the hand - hurled harpoon , to the blunderbuss firing barbed arrows , to the duck gun with exploding bullets . on the forecastle was mounted the latest model breech - loading cannon , very heavy of barrel and narrow of bore , a weapon that would figure in the universal exhibition of 1867 . made in america , this valuable instrument could fire a four - kilogram conical projectile an average distance of sixteen kilometers without the least bother .",78
"but as the invasion of the plateau could only be made by the left bank of the mercy , it was sufficient to oppose the colpeos on the narrow bank between the river and the cliff of granite .",28
"she is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good english education , together with french , drawing , and music "" ( in those days , reader , this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments , would have been held tolerably comprehensive ) .",32
"a narrow ridge , left bare by the retreat of the water , allowed them to approach it .",1
""" well , captain , what are we stopping for ? "" asked the sailor , impatient to enter the narrow passage .",20
"a complete survey of the coast had not yet been made , and the colonists had but an imperfect idea of the shore to the west and north , from the mouth of falls river to the mandible capes , as well as of the narrow bay between them , which opened like a shark 's jaws .",45
"the colonists were again shut up in granite house , and as it was necessary to hermetically seal all the openings of the facade , only leaving a narrow passage for renewing the air , the consumption of candles was considerable .",28
"it appeared however to milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening . but whether this was reality or vision , he had this time sufficient self - command not to enter .",37
it will be easily conceived that after an imprisonment of forty seven days in a narrow gallery it was the height of physical enjoyment to breathe a moist air impregnated with saline particles .,15
"arrived at port balloon , pencroft saw with extreme satisfaction that the "" bonadventure "" was tranquilly floating in the narrow creek .",20
"leaning over the edge of our narrow standing ground , i observed that the bottom of the hole was still invisible .",6
the faithful dog found granite house very narrow .,7
could narrow passages spread from it through the foundations of the island ?,1
"the maneuver consisted simply in surrounding the musmons and goats , and gradually narrowing the circle around them .",13
"john bunsby had requested his passengers to go below ; but this imprisonment in so narrow a space , with little air , and the boat bouncing in the gale , was far from pleasant . neither mr . fogg , fix , nor aouda consented to leave the deck .",15
"i had risen half - an - hour before her entrance , and had washed my face , and put on my clothes by the light of a half - moon just setting , whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib .",39
"knowing that englishmen governed by a fixed idea sometimes resort to the desperate expedient of suicide , passepartout kept a narrow watch upon his master , though he carefully concealed the appearance of so doing .",20
"the next day , february 7 , we entered the strait of bab el mandeb , whose name means "" gate of tears "" in the arabic language . twenty miles wide , it 's only fifty - two kilometers long , and with the nautilus launched at full speed , clearing it was the work of barely an hour . but i did n't see a thing , not even perim island where the british government built fortifications to strengthen aden 's position . there were many english and french steamers plowing this narrow passageway , liners going from suez to bombay , calcutta , melbourne , réunion island , and mauritius ; far too much traffic for the nautilus to make an appearance on the surface . so it wisely stayed in midwater .",94
"between these were narrow valleys , bristling with trees , the last clumps of which rose to the top of the lowest cone .",3
"again i looked out : we were passing a church ; i saw its low broad tower against the sky , and its bell was tolling a quarter ; i saw a narrow galaxy of lights too , on a hillside , marking a village or hamlet .",32
"where they had only expected to find a narrow cavity , they had found a sort of marvelous palace , and neb had taken off his hat , as if he had been transported into a temple !",8
"it was , perhaps , the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar which gave birth , in great measure , to the fantastic character of the performances .",6
"pencroft and ayrton , each hidden in a narrow cleft of the rock , saw them coming directly towards them , and waited till they were within range .",8
"when the first streaks of dawn appeared in the western horizon , the wind , which had slightly fallen , shifted two points , and enabled pencroft to enter the narrow gulf with greater ease .",30
"between the river 's mouth and the end of the cliff , eddies of wind whirled and gusts from this maelstrom lashed the water which ran through the narrow valley .",28
""" no doubt , "" returned the sailor , "" since the wind has only that narrow entrance between the two capes to get in by , and , besides , the north cape protects that of the south in a way which would make the entrance of gusts very difficult .",16
""" yes , sir , a natural barometer that did n't let me down when i navigated the narrows of the strait of magellan . """,18
some rock pigeons were already flying in and out of the narrow opening ; they evidently thought that granite house had been discovered on purpose for them .,11
"i looked around me . we were standing at the intersection of two roads , both dark and narrow . which were we to take ? this was a difficulty .",18
"in others , obstructed by rocks , there was only a narrow path , in which two persons could not walk abreast .",11
""" nothing in the world , "" was the reply ; and , replacing the paper , i saw him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin . it disappeared in his glove ; and , with one hasty nod and "" good - afternoon , "" he vanished .",23
from this point to claw cape the beach was very narrow between the edge of the forest and the reefs .,10
"it formed quite a natural harbor , invisible from the sea , and was entered by a narrow channel .",17
"after ten hours ' walking i observed a singular deadening of the reflection of our lamps from the side walls . the marble , the schist , the limestone , and the sandstone were giving way to a dark and lustreless lining . at one moment , the tunnel becoming very narrow , i leaned against the wall .",51
"there were no longer high cliffs as at prospect heights , but a strange and capricious border which surrounded the narrow gulf between the two capes , formed of mineral matter , thrown up by the volcano .",20
"pencroft had remarked , several hundred feet from the place at which they landed , a narrow cutting , out of which he thought a river or stream might issue .",16
"at the northeast two other capes closed the bay , and between them ran a narrow gulf , which looked like the half - open jaws of a formidable dog - fish .",15
"from this point the shore ran pretty regularly north and south , broken at two - thirds of its perimeter by a narrow creek , from which it ended in a long tail , similar to the caudal appendage of a gigantic alligator .",22
"at the narrowest part , that is to say between the chimneys and the creek on the western shore , which corresponded to it in latitude , the island only measured ten miles ; but its greatest length , from the jaws at the northeast to the extremity of the tail of the southwest , was not less than thirty miles .",2
flight was out of the question now . the reptiles rose ; they wheeled around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express trains . they described around us gradually narrowing circles . i took up my rifle . but what could a ball do against the scaly armour with which these enormous beasts were clad ?,33
""" i see a little river which runs into it , "" said herbert , pointing out a narrow stream , which evidently took its source somewhere in the west .",18
"meanwhile , crazed with terror , the unhinged papuans beat a retreat . as for us , half laughing , we massaged and comforted poor ned land , who was swearing like one possessed . but just then , lifted off by the tide 's final undulations , the nautilus left its coral bed at exactly that fortieth minute pinpointed by the captain . its propeller churned the waves with lazy majesty . gathering speed little by little , the ship navigated on the surface of the ocean , and safe and sound , it left behind the dangerous narrows of the torres strait .",99
"from eight to nine o'clock , the nautilus stayed a few meters beneath the waters . according to my calculations , we had to be quite close to suez . through the panels in the lounge , i spotted rocky bottoms brightly lit by our electric rays . it seemed to me that the strait was getting narrower and narrower .",57

obliquely to the oval of the island ran a stream through a wide meadow falling into the sea on the west by a narrow mouth .,23
"mrs . fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap - door ; i , by drift of groping , found the outlet from the attic , and proceeded to descend the narrow garret staircase .",33
"it was on this side that , at the time when the mountain was in a state of eruption , the discharge had worn away a passage , and a large heap of lava had spread to the narrow jaw which formed the northeastern gulf .",38
it had indeed been a narrow escape for cyrus harding !,5
"we had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from the road and wound away across the moor . a steep , boulder - sprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone days been cut into a granite quarry . the face which was turned towards us formed a dark cliff , with ferns and brambles growing in its niches . from over a distant rise there floated a gray plume of smoke .",8
""" what 's more , ned , "" i said , "" captain nemo himself did the honors in his tunnel , and i stood beside him in the pilothouse while he steered the nautilus through that narrow passageway . """,37
"on the 2nd , at six in the evening , all our precious baggage being safely on board the _ valkyria , _ the captain took us into a very narrow cabin .",30
"the narrow hatch had barely closed over me when i was surrounded by profound darkness . saturated with the outside light , my eyes could n't make out a thing . i felt my naked feet clinging to the steps of an iron ladder . forcibly seized , ned land and conseil were behind me . at the foot of the ladder , a door opened and instantly closed behind us with a loud clang .",1
"the gate was secured on the outside , and cyrus harding , preceding ayrton , took the narrow path which led westward to the shore .",17
"pencroft soon brought the canoe to the shore by a narrow passage among the rocks , and it was agreed that they should make a trial of the boat that day by following the shore as far as the first point at which the rocks of the south ended .",10
"in what land ? under what auspices ? my eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower near the gates , and i asked , "" is he with damer de rochester , sharing the shelter of his narrow marble house ? """,38
they made their way then along the narrow valley separating two of the largest spurs of mount franklin .,7
"their costume consisted of a coarse jacket of black woollen cloth called in scandinavian lands a ' vadmel , ' a hat with a very broad brim , trousers with a narrow edge of red , and a bit of leather rolled round the foot for shoes .",31
"cyrus harding and his companions then climbed the spur rising between the corral valley and that of falls river , which they crossed at its narrowest part .",25
"' that was a narrow escape ! ' said alice , a good deal frightened at the sudden change , but very glad to find herself still in existence ; ' and now for the garden ! ' and she ran with all speed back to the little door : but , alas ! the little door was shut again , and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before , ' and things are worse than ever , ' thought the poor child , ' for i never was so small as this before , never ! and i declare it 's too bad , that it is ! '",4
"the seafloor kept sinking , and its significantly steeper slope took us to greater depths . it must have been nearly three o'clock when we reached a narrow valley gouged between high , vertical walls and located 150 meters down . thanks to the perfection of our equipment , we had thus gone ninety meters below the limit that nature had , until then , set on man 's underwater excursions .",27
"there appeared a narrow ridge , running horizontally and parallel with the sea .",3
"i now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture . yes , i was right : it was mr . brocklehurst , buttoned up in a surtout , and looking longer , narrower , and more rigid than ever .",32
"the storm burst during the daytime of may 13 , just as the nautilus was cruising abreast of long island , a few miles from the narrows to upper new york bay . i 'm able to describe this struggle of the elements because captain nemo did n't flee into the ocean depths ; instead , from some inexplicable whim , he decided to brave it out on the surface .",26
""" now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find everything else for yourself . now let me endeavour to show you the different steps in my reasoning . to begin at the beginning . i approached the house , as you know , on foot , and with my mind entirely free from all impressions . i naturally began by examining the roadway , and there , as i have already explained to you , i saw clearly the marks of a cab , which , i ascertained by inquiry , must have been there during the night . i satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels . the ordinary london growler is considerably less wide than a gentleman 's brougham .",122
large flat stones were placed on the ground at the opening of the narrow passage which had been kept .,13
"pencroft again brought the brig within the range of the telescope , and could see that she was of between three and four hundred tons burden , wonderfully narrow , well - masted , admirably built , and must be a very rapid sailer .",28
"i sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled . i forgot that i was in london and in the nineteenth century . i was away with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen . after the performance was over , i went behind and spoke to her . as we were sitting together , suddenly there came into her eyes a look that i had never seen there before . my lips moved towards hers . we kissed each other . i ca n't describe to you what i felt at that moment . it seemed to me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of rose - coloured joy . she trembled all over and shook like a white narcissus . then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands . i feel that i should not tell you all this , but i ca n't help it . of course , our engagement is a dead secret . she has not even told her own mother . i do n't know what my guardians will say . lord radley is sure to be furious . i do n't care . i shall be of age in less than a year , and then i can do what i like . i have been right , basil , have n't i , to take my love out of poetry and to find my wife in shakespeare 's plays ? lips that shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear . i have had the arms of rosalind around me , and kissed juliet on the mouth .

"in an hour we had reached the islet . two hours later we had completed a full circle around it . it measured four to five miles in circumference . a narrow channel separated it from a considerable shore , perhaps a continent whose limits we could n't see . the existence of this shore seemed to bear out commander maury 's hypotheses . in essence , this ingenious american has noted that between the south pole and the 60th parallel , the sea is covered with floating ice of dimensions much greater than any found in the north atlantic . from this fact he drew the conclusion that the antarctic circle must contain considerable shores , since icebergs ca n't form on the high seas but only along coastlines . according to his calculations , this frozen mass enclosing the southernmost pole forms a vast ice cap whose width must reach 4,000 kilometers .",31
""" especially , "" i replied , "" if it happens that we have only crossed it in its narrowest part . and it is a curious circumstance , "" i added , "" that if my computations are right , and we are nine hundred leagues from rejkiavik , we have now the mediterranean above our head . """,19
"' oh ! so bill 's got to come down the chimney , has he ? ' said alice to herself . ' shy , they seem to put everything upon bill ! i would n't be in bill 's place for a good deal : this fireplace is narrow , to be sure ; but i think i can kick a little ! '",49
"yes , life of some kind there was ; for i heard a movement -- that narrow front - door was unclosing , and some shape was about to issue from the grange .",16
