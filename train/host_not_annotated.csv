"on the 15th our preparations were all made . our host gave the professor very great pleasure by presenting him with a map of iceland far more complete than that of hendersen . it was the map of m. olaf nikolas olsen , in the proportion of 1 to 480,000 of the actual size of the island , and published by the icelandic literary society . it was a precious document for a mineralogist .",10
""" oh , yes ! perfectly safe and sound , my good host ; and i wish to know what has become of our young man . """,12
"when we had laid aside our travelling wraps the voice of the host was heard inviting us to the kitchen , the only room where a fire was lighted even in the severest cold .",12
"at five next morning we bade our host farewell , my uncle with difficulty persuading him to accept a proper remuneration ; and hans signalled the start .",7
"now , my dear host , while your young man was insensible , you did not fail , i am quite sure , to ascertain what that pocket contained .",4
""" host , "" said he , "" could you not contrive to get rid of this frantic boy for me ?",1
"let our readers reassure themselves . if d’artagnan forgets his host , or appears to forget him , under the pretense of not knowing where he has been carried , we will not forget him , and we know where he is .",10
""" my faith , my good host , "" said d’artagnan , filling the two glasses , "" i asked for a bottle of your best wine , and if you have deceived me , you will be punished in what you have sinned ; for seeing that i hate drinking my myself , you shall drink with me .",6
"but i could n't linger . captain nemo , on familiar terms with these dreadful animals , no longer minded them . we arrived at a preliminary plateau where still other surprises were waiting for me . there picturesque ruins took shape , betraying the hand of man , not our creator . they were huge stacks of stones in which you could distinguish the indistinct forms of palaces and temples , now arrayed in hosts of blossoming zoophytes , and over it all , not ivy but a heavy mantle of algae and fucus plants .",75
""" then , "" continued the host , "" i replied that as from the moment we seemed not likely to come to a good understanding with respect to payment , i hoped that he would have at least the kindness to grant the favor of his custom to my brother host of the golden eagle ; but monsieur porthos replied that , my house being the best , he should remain where he was .",51
""" here is the story , monseigneur , "" resumed the trembling host ; "" for i now recollect you . it was you who rode off at the moment i had that unfortunate difference with the gentleman you speak of . """,12
it displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations .,5
"so , my dear host , be not uneasy , and continue to take all the care of him that his situation requires . """,4
""" but your host behaves very well toward you , as it appears , my dear porthos , "" said d’artagnan , directing the sick man ’s attention to the full stewpans and the empty bottles .",3
"he asked where their masters were , and was informed that they had passed the night in the inn , and were then settling their bill with the host .",28
"not at all . i am dead drunk , that ’s all , and never did a man more strongly set about getting so . by the lord , my good host !",31
""" some wine ! "" cried the stupefied host , "" some wine ? why you have drunk more than a hundred pistoles ’ worth !",8
""" but the wine , "" said d’artagnan , "" who furnishes the wine ? your host ? """,16
"you cursed host ! a dripping pan immediately , that i may not lose a drop of the fat of this estimable bird . """,2
"this current swept along with it a whole host of moving creatures . argonauts , so common in the mediterranean , voyaged here in schools of large numbers . among cartilaginous fish , the most remarkable were rays whose ultra slender tails made up nearly a third of the body , which was shaped like a huge diamond twenty - five feet long ; then little one - meter sharks , the head large , the snout short and rounded , the teeth sharp and arranged in several rows , the body seemingly covered with scales .",8
the host himself brought my breakfast into the parlour . i requested him to shut the door and sit down : i had some questions to ask him .,1
""" but where are you going to eat my breakfast ? "" asked the host .",14
"after a good walk i returned to m. fridrikssen 's house , where i found my uncle already in his host 's company .",20
""" me , i 'm out like a light ! "" ned land replied . my two companions lay down on the cabin 's carpeting and were soon deep in slumber . as for me , i gave in less readily to this intense need for sleep . too many thoughts had piled up in my mind , too many insoluble questions had arisen , too many images were keeping my eyelids open ! where were we ? what strange power was carrying us along ? i felt -- or at least i thought i did -- the submersible sinking toward the sea 's lower strata . intense nightmares besieged me . in these mysterious marine sanctuaries , i envisioned hosts of unknown animals , and this underwater boat seemed to be a blood relation of theirs : living , breathing , just as fearsome . . . ! then my mind grew calmer , my imagination melted into hazy drowsiness , and i soon fell into an uneasy slumber .",120
""" have you some private document in your possession ? "" asked our host .",13
"sheer chance had placed me in the presence of the most valuable specimens of this zoophyte . this coral was the equal of those fished up from the mediterranean off the barbary coast or the shores of france and italy . with its bright colors , it lived up to those poetic names of blood flower and blood foam that the industry confers on its finest exhibits . coral sells for as much as 500 francs per kilogram , and in this locality the liquid strata hid enough to make the fortunes of a whole host of coral fishermen . this valuable substance often merges with other polyparies , forming compact , hopelessly tangled units known as "" macciota , "" and i noted some wonderful pink samples of this coral .",95
"i rushed up onto the platform . yes , open sea ! barely a few sparse floes , some moving icebergs ; a sea stretching into the distance ; hosts of birds in the air and myriads of fish under the waters , which varied from intense blue to olive green depending on the depth . the thermometer marked 3 degrees centigrade . it was as if a comparative springtime had been locked up behind that ice bank , whose distant masses were outlined on the northern horizon .",29
"this momentous conversation ended in a few minutes with warm acknowledgments paid by the german to the icelandic professor . at this dinner my uncle had just elicited important facts , amongst others , the history of saknussemm , the reason of the mysterious document , that his host would not accompany him in his expedition , and that the very next day a guide would be waiting upon him .",48
"the whole looked , as the host of the rochester arms had said , "" quite a desolate spot . """,6
