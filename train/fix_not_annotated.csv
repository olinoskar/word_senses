"on january 28 , in latitude 9 degrees 4 ' north , when the nautilus returned at noon to the surface of the sea , it lay in sight of land some eight miles to the west . right off , i observed a cluster of mountains about 2,000 feet high , whose shapes were very whimsically sculpted . after our position fix , i reentered the lounge , and when our bearings were reported on the chart , i saw that we were off the island of ceylon , that pearl dangling from the lower lobe of the indian peninsula .",62
"this expression rather disturbed fix , without his knowing why . had the frenchman guessed his real purpose ? he knew not what to think . but how could passepartout have discovered that he was a detective ? yet , in speaking as he did , the man evidently meant more than he expressed .",4

"fix looked intently at his companion , whose countenance was as serene as possible , and laughed with him . but passepartout persisted in chaffing him by asking him if he made much by his present occupation .",0
"nevertheless , he preserved his coolness of mind , and at last resolved to deal plainly with passepartout . if he did not find it practicable to arrest fogg at hong kong , and if fogg made preparations to leave that last foothold of english territory , he , fix , would tell passepartout all . either the servant was the accomplice of his master , and in this case the master knew of his operations , and he should fail ; or else the servant knew nothing about the robbery , and then his interest would be to abandon the robber .",49
"such was the situation between fix and passepartout . meanwhile phileas fogg moved about above them in the most majestic and unconscious indifference . he was passing methodically in his orbit around the world , regardless of the lesser stars which gravitated around him . yet",5
"a sudden pallor overspread the detective 's face . separate himself from the man whom he had so persistently followed step by step ! leave him to wander about in this desert ! fix gazed attentively at mr . fogg , and , despite his suspicions and of the struggle which was going on within him , he lowered his eyes before that calm and frank look .",33
""" i have been an idiot ! "" he thought , "" and this man will see it . he has gone , and wo n't come back ! but how is it that i , fix , who have in my pocket a warrant for his arrest , have been so fascinated by him ? decidedly , i am nothing but an ass ! """,36
"as i looked at his lofty forehead , still and pale as a white stone -- at his fine lineaments fixed in study -- i comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband : that it would be a trying thing to be his wife .",20
"fix did not look at the state of things in the same light . the storm greatly pleased him . his satisfaction would have been complete had the rangoon been forced to retreat before the violence of wind and waves . each delay filled him with hope , for it became more and more probable that fogg would be obliged to remain some days at hong kong ; and now the heavens themselves became his allies , with the gusts and squalls . it mattered not that they made him sea - sick -- he made no account of this inconvenience ; and , whilst his body was writhing under their effects , his spirit bounded with hopeful exultation .",0
"the pilot went on board at six , and took his place on the bridge , to guide the rangoon through the channels to the port of hong kong . passepartout longed to ask him if the steamer had left for yokohama ; but he dared not , for he wished to preserve the spark of hope , which still remained till the last moment . he had confided his anxiety to fix who -- the sly rascal!--tried to console him by saying that mr . fogg would be in time if he took the next boat ; but this only put passepartout in a passion .",72

"in essence , on july 20 , 1866 , the steamer governor higginson , from the calcutta & burnach steam navigation co. , encountered this moving mass five miles off the eastern shores of australia . captain baker at first thought he was in the presence of an unknown reef ; he was even about to fix its exact position when two waterspouts shot out of this inexplicable object and sprang hissing into the air some 150 feet . so , unless this reef was subject to the intermittent eruptions of a geyser , the governor higginson had fair and honest dealings with some aquatic mammal , until then unknown , that could spurt from its blowholes waterspouts mixed with air and steam .",56

"he conjured the evil spirit with abundance of prayers offered up by the monks . but the devil does not suffer himself to be easily dispossessed from a place in which he has fixed his garrison . in proportion as they redoubled the exorcisms he redoubled the temptations ; so that day and night the bell was ringing full swing , announcing the extreme desire for mortification which the penitent experienced .",33
"thus engaged , he appeared , sitting in his own recess , quiet and absorbed enough ; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish- looking grammar , and wandering over , and sometimes fixing upon us , his fellow - students , with a curious intensity of observation : if caught , it would be instantly withdrawn ; yet ever and anon , it returned searchingly to our table .",39
"they ordered two bottles of port , to which the frenchman did ample justice , whilst fix observed him with close attention . they chatted about the journey , and passepartout was especially merry at the idea that fix was going to continue it with them . when the bottles were empty , however , he rose to go and tell his master of the change in the time of the sailing of the carnatic .",38

"it was the man who had spoken to fix during the night , and whose offer he had refused .",8
"there mr . fogg examined a curious vehicle , a kind of frame on two long beams , a little raised in front like the runners of a sledge , and upon which there was room for five or six persons . a high mast was fixed on the frame , held firmly by metallic lashings , to which was attached a large brigantine sail . this mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist a jib - sail . behind , a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle . it was , in short , a sledge rigged like a sloop . during the winter , when the trains are blocked up by the snow , these sledges make extremely rapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another . provided with more sails than a cutter , and with the wind behind them , they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not superior to that of the express trains .",46

"fix , it must be confessed , understood nothing of what was going on . the conquest of the henrietta , the bribery of the crew , fogg managing the boat like a skilled seaman , amazed and confused him . he did not know what to think . for , after all , a man who began by stealing fifty - five thousand pounds might end by stealing a vessel ; and fix was not unnaturally inclined to conclude that the henrietta under fogg 's command , was not going to liverpool at all , but to some part of the world where the robber , turned into a pirate , would quietly put himself in safety . the conjecture was at least a plausible one , and the detective began to seriously regret that he had embarked on the affair .",0

"passepartout , when he saw his master arrested , would have fallen upon fix had he not been held back by some policemen . aouda was thunderstruck at the suddenness of an event which she could not understand . passepartout explained to her how it was that the honest and courageous fogg was arrested as a robber . the young woman 's heart revolted against so heinous a charge , and when she saw that she could attempt to do nothing to save her protector , she wept bitterly .",13

"knowing that englishmen governed by a fixed idea sometimes resort to the desperate expedient of suicide , passepartout kept a narrow watch upon his master , though he carefully concealed the appearance of so doing .",6
"passepartout , having received his orders , had nothing to do but obey them . he looked at his imperturbable master , and could scarcely bring his mind to leave him . his heart was full , and his conscience tortured by remorse ; for he accused himself more bitterly than ever of being the cause of the irretrievable disaster . yes ! if he had warned mr . fogg , and had betrayed fix 's projects to him , his master would certainly not have given the detective passage to liverpool , and then--",74

"the effect of these replies upon the already suspicious and excited detective may be imagined . the hasty departure from london soon after the robbery ; the large sum carried by mr . fogg ; his eagerness to reach distant countries ; the pretext of an eccentric and foolhardy bet -- all confirmed fix in his theory . he continued to pump poor passepartout , and learned that he really knew little or nothing of his master , who lived a solitary existence in london , was said to be rich , though no one knew whence came his riches , and was mysterious and impenetrable in his affairs and habits . fix felt sure that phileas fogg would not land at suez , but was really going on to bombay .",112

"the steamer lay puffing alongside the quay , on the point of starting . passepartout had but few steps to go ; and , rushing upon the plank , he crossed it , and fell unconscious on the deck , just as the carnatic was moving off . several sailors , who were evidently accustomed to this sort of scene , carried the poor frenchman down into the second cabin , and passepartout did not wake until they were one hundred and fifty miles away from china . thus he found himself the next morning on the deck of the carnatic , and eagerly inhaling the exhilarating sea - breeze . the pure air sobered him . he began to collect his sense , which he found a difficult task ; but at last he recalled the events of the evening before , fix 's revelation , and the opium - house .",143

"aouda , leaning upon mr . fogg 's arm , observed the tumultuous scene with surprise , while fix asked a man near him what the cause of it all was . before the man could reply , a fresh agitation arose ; hurrahs and excited shouts were heard ; the staffs of the banners began to be used as offensive weapons ; and fists flew about in every direction . thumps were exchanged from the tops of the carriages and omnibuses which had been blocked up in the crowd . boots and shoes went whirling through the air , and mr . fogg thought he even heard the crack of revolvers mingling in the din , the rout approached the stairway , and flowed over the lower step . one of the parties had evidently been repulsed ; but the mere lookers - on could not tell whether mandiboy or camerfield had gained the upper hand .",18
""" it would be prudent for us to retire , "" said fix , who was anxious that mr . fogg should not receive any injury , at least until they got back to london . "" if there is any question about england in all this , and we were recognised , i fear it would go hard with us . """,12
"_ oct . _ 26.—i walked about the shore almost all day , to find out a place to fix my habitation , greatly concerned to secure myself from any attack in the night , either from wild beasts or men . towards night , i fixed upon a proper place , under a rock , and marked out a semicircle for my encampment ; which i resolved to strengthen with a work , wall , or fortification , made of double piles , lined within with cables , and without with turf .",46
"the human tide now swept by , after overturning fix , who speedily got upon his feet again , though with tattered clothes . happily , he was not seriously hurt . his travelling overcoat was divided into two unequal parts , and his trousers resembled those of certain indians , which fit less compactly than they are easy to put on . aouda had escaped unharmed , and fix alone bore marks of the fray in his black and blue bruise .",69
"aramis appeared to make a strong inward effort , like a man who , in the full relation of a falsehood , finds himself stopped by some unforeseen obstacle ; but the eyes of his three companions were fixed upon him , their ears were wide open , and there were no means of retreat .",38

"we were traveling due west and on january 11 we doubled cape wessel , located in longitude 135 degrees and latitude 10 degrees north , the western tip of the gulf of carpentaria . reefs were still numerous but more widely scattered and were fixed on the chart with the greatest accuracy . the nautilus easily avoided the money breakers to port and the victoria reefs to starboard , positioned at longitude 130 degrees on the tenth parallel , which we went along rigorously .",44
"there was but little conversation in the car , and soon many of the passengers were overcome with sleep . passepartout found himself beside the detective ; but he did not talk to him . after recent events , their relations with each other had grown somewhat cold ; there could no longer be mutual sympathy or intimacy between them . fix 's manner had not changed ; but passepartout was very reserved , and ready to strangle his former friend on the slightest provocation .",61

"after our position fix , the nautilus 's latitude bearings were modulated to the southwest . our prow pointed to the indian ocean . where would captain nemo 's fancies take us ? would he head up to the shores of asia ? would he pull nearer to the beaches of europe ? unlikely choices for a man who avoided populated areas ! so would he go down south ? would he double the cape of good hope , then cape horn , and push on to the antarctic pole ? finally , would he return to the seas of the pacific , where his nautilus could navigate freely and easily ? time would tell .",3
"motionless , with her burning and fixed glances , in her solitary apartment , how well the outbursts of passion which at times escape from the depths of her chest with her respiration , accompany the sound of the surf which rises , growls , roars , and breaks itself like an eternal and powerless despair against the rocks on which is built this dark and lofty castle !",6
"the union of physical pain with moral uneasiness had produced the effect so long desired . aramis , suffering at once in body and mind , had at length fixed his eyes and his thoughts upon religion , and he had considered as a warning from heaven the double accident which had happened to him ; that is to say , the sudden disappearance of his mistress and the wound in his shoulder .",29

"captain nemo reentered his stateroom , and i saw no more of him for a good while . but how sad , despairing , and irresolute he must have felt , to judge from this ship whose soul he was , which reflected his every mood ! the nautilus no longer kept to a fixed heading . it drifted back and forth , riding with the waves like a corpse . its propeller had been disentangled but was barely put to use . it was navigating at random . it could n't tear itself away from the setting of this last struggle , from this sea that had devoured one of its own !",54
