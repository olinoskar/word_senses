"neb rushed after him , and soon saw top eagerly devouring a quadruped , which ten seconds later would have been past recognizing in top 's stomach .",8

"at the same time top began to run round the mouth of the well , which opened at the extremity of the interior passage .",4

"top accompanied him , and gideon spilett , his gun cocked , was ready for any emergency .",0
"his dog would have warned him of any danger , and , as top did not bark , it might be concluded that there was nothing to fear at the moment at least , and that the convicts were occupied in another part of the island .",13
"however , on his second sortie , on the 27th of november , gideon spilett , who had ventured a quarter of a mile into the woods , towards the south of the mountain , remarked that top scented something .",37
"gideon spilett followed top , encouraged him , excited him by his voice , while keeping a sharp look - out , his gun ready to fire , and sheltering himself behind the trees .",3
"it was not probable that top scented the presence of man , for in that case , he would have announced it by half - uttered , sullen , angry barks .",5
at the top of the stairs he found planchet in a great fright .,2
"nearly five minutes passed thus , top rummaging , the reporter following him prudently when , all at once , the dog rushed towards a thick bush , and drew out a rag .",6
why did top so often run round this opening ?,2
"top helped in the capture of these birds , whose name was given to this marshy part of the island .",0
"on this day , therefore , in presence of all the members of the colony , including master jup and top , the four cannon were successively tried .",20
top wore a necklace of teal and jup wreaths of snipe round his body .,0
"' there might be some sense in your knocking , ' the footman went on without attending to her , ' if we had the door between us . for instance , if you were inside , you might knock , and i could let you out , you know .

"the latter took top 's head between his hands , and unfastening the collar which the animal wore round his neck , he broke it in two , saying,-- "" there are two knives , pencroft ! """,3
"it was jup , master jup in person , to whom top immediately gave a most cordial reception .",11
"certainly if neb had any important matter to communicate to his master he could not employ a more sure or more rapid messenger , who could pass where neither the colonists could , nor even top himself .",35
"the next day , january 5 , after its deck paneling was opened , the skiff was wrenched from its socket and launched to sea from the top of the platform . two men were sufficient for this operation . the oars were inside the longboat and we had only to take our seats .",27

"i instantly plunged the end of the fuse into the lantern . it spluttered and flamed , and i ran at the top of my speed to the raft .",22
"at that instant i was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab . instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up , something was screamed to the driver , and the cab flew madly off down regent street . holmes looked eagerly round for another , but no empty one was in sight . then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic , but the start was too great , and already the cab was out of sight .",33

the hunters had scarcely entered the bushes when they saw top engaged in a struggle with an animal which he was holding by the ear .,10
"the settlers went to the chimneys to take some pickaxes , iron - tipped spears , string made of fibers , flint and steel ; they then returned to the plateau , top accompanying them .",32
"top fought with actual fury , flying at the throats of the foxes and strangling them instantaneously .",0
"top plunged into the water , but the capybara , hidden at the bottom of the pond , did not appear .",0
"the shellfish meleagrina , that womb for pearls whose valves are nearly equal in size , has the shape of a round shell with thick walls and a very rough exterior . some of these shells were furrowed with flaky , greenish bands that radiated down from the top . these were the young oysters . the others had rugged black surfaces , measured up to fifteen centimeters in width , and were ten or more years old .",48
top remained in the water .,0
""" you see top has got before us ! """,3
"from time to time top , walking on tip - toe , as one might say , came to visit his friend , and seemed to approve of all the care that had been taken of him .",4
"one of jup 's hands hung over the side of his bed , and top licked it with a sympathizing air .",14
"however , top kept at the head of the little band , and they could rely on the sagacity of the dog , who would not fail to give the alarm if there was any need for it .",2
"the railings , fittings , the greater part of the deck , and top sides disappeared on the 20th , and the henrietta was now only a flat hulk .",13
"the trees on the right bank were as close together as on the left bank , and it was impossible to distinguish anything beyond them ; but these masses of wood were evidently uninhabited , for top did not bark , and the intelligent animal would not have failed to signal the presence of any stranger in the neighborhood .",36
"a pretty little house stood at the top of the lane , with a garden before it , exquisitely neat and brilliantly blooming . i stopped at it .",7
"but top had disappeared at the same time as his master , and had probably perished with him .",1
""" where is top ? "" asked neb , interrupting his master .",3
"it was , therefore , nineteen days since neb had had other news than that brought by top -- disastrous news : ayrton disappeared , herbert severely wounded , the engineer , reporter , and sailor , as it were , imprisoned in the corral !",17
""" that is top barking ! "" cried herbert .",3
"but it must be said , that the one who was most impatient of this imprisonment , after pencroft perhaps , was top .",22
""" i am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming round , mr . hubbard . i shall certainly drop in and look at the frame-- though i do n't go in much at present for religious art -- but to - day i only want a picture carried to the top of the house for me . it is rather heavy , so i thought i would ask you to lend me a couple of your men .

"that done , he retired the necessary distance , when , lying on the sand , his eye glanced at the same time at the top of the pole and the crest of the cliff .",25
"he chose a straight young fir , with no knots , and which he had only to square at the step , and round off at the top .",27

"the coach drew up ; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its top laden with passengers : the guard and coachman loudly urged haste ; my trunk was hoisted up ; i was taken from bessie 's neck , to which i clung with kisses .",17

"d’artagnan offered his arm to mme . bonacieux , who willingly took it , half laughing , half trembling , and both gained the top of rue de la harpe .",24
"at the top of the stairs , upon the most conspicuous door of the corridor , was traced in black ink a gigantic number "" 1 . "" d’artagnan knocked , and upon the bidding to come in which came from inside , he entered the chamber .",2
in addition to this he perceived that the top of a wardrobe and the marble of a commode were covered with empty bottles .,8

"there was a cry heard , and a crash . the cry was so horrible in its agony that the frightened servants woke and crept out of their rooms . two gentlemen , who were passing in the square below , stopped and looked up at the great house . they walked on till they met a policeman and brought him back . the man rang the bell several times , but there was no answer . except for a light in one of the top windows , the house was all dark . after a time , he went away and stood in an adjoining portico and watched .",85
"felton jumped onshore , climbed the little ascent which led to the top of the cliff , saluted milady a last time , and took his course toward the city .",12
"when they reached the top landing , dorian set the lamp down on the floor , and taking out the key , turned it in the lock . "" you insist on knowing , basil ? "" he asked in a low voice .",4
"top particularly was enchanted with this improvement , for he had not , and never could have possessed master jup 's skill in climbing ladders , and often it was on neb 's back , or even on that of the orang that he had been obliged to make the ascent to granite house .",0

"a little hamlet , whose roofs were blent with trees , straggled up the side of one of these hills ; the church of the district stood nearer thornfield : its old tower - top looked over a knoll between the house and gates .",34
"the same day an odd fishing practice further increased the nautilus 's stores , so full of game were these seas . our trawl brought up in its meshes a number of fish whose heads were topped by little oval slabs with fleshy edges . these were suckerfish from the third family of the subbrachian malacopterygia . these flat disks on their heads consist of crosswise plates of movable cartilage , between which the animals can create a vacuum , enabling them to stick to objects like suction cups .",36
"as a last scene , a "" human pyramid "" had been announced , in which fifty long noses were to represent the car of juggernaut . but , instead of forming a pyramid by mounting each other 's shoulders , the artists were to group themselves on top of the noses . it happened that the performer who had hitherto formed the base of the car had quitted the troupe , and as , to fill this part , only strength and adroitness were necessary , passepartout had been chosen to take his place .",48

"once or twice in the daytime i thought i saw the pico of teneriffe , being the high top of the mountain teneriffe in the canaries , and had a great mind to venture out , in hopes of reaching thither ; but having tried twice , i was forced in again by contrary winds , the sea also going too high for my little vessel ; so , i resolved to pursue my first design , and keep along the shore .",18
top uttered sullen groans which were rather ominous .,0
"how many other marvelous new specimens i still could have observed if , little by little , the nautilus had n't settled to the lower strata ! its slanting fins drew it to depths of 2,000 and 3,500 meters . there animal life was represented by nothing more than sea lilies , starfish , delightful crinoids with bell - shaped heads like little chalices on straight stems , top - shell snails , blood - red tooth shells , and fissurella snails , a large species of coastal mollusk .",68

"it was indeed top , a magnificent anglo - norman , who derived from these two races crossed the swiftness of foot and the acuteness of smell which are the preeminent qualities of coursing dogs .",3

"the second level was separated by a perpendicular granite cliff , terminated at the top by an unequal edge at a height of at least 300 feet .",14
""" singular instinct ! "" returned the reporter , "" since notwithstanding the storm of rain and wind which was raging during that night , top arrived at the chimneys , dry and without a speck of mud ! """,25
"but what was still more inexplicable was , that top was neither tired , nor exhausted , nor even soiled with mud or sand!--herbert had drawn him towards him , and was patting his head , the dog rubbing his neck against the lad 's hands .",9
"top will guide us ! """,0
"but pencroft was such a zealous master , that top ended by properly performing his ascents , and soon mounted the ladder as readily as his brethren in the circus .",9
"in search of a place proper for this , i found a little plain on the side of a rising hill , whose front towards this little plain was steep as a house - side , so that nothing could come down upon me from the top . on the one side of the rock there was a hollow place , worn a little way in , like the entrance or door of a cave but there was not really any cave or way into the rock at all .",46
""" saved , is n't he ? "" repeated herbert ; "" saved , top ? """,14
"the entrance into this place i made to be , not by a door , but by a short ladder to go over the top ; which ladder , when i was in , i lifted over after me ; and so i was completely fenced in and fortified , as i thought , from all the world , and consequently slept secure in the night , which otherwise i could not have done ; though , as it appeared afterwards , there was no need of all this caution from the enemies that i apprehended danger from .",24

"top still barked , and by his going and coming , seemed to invite his master to follow him into the forest .",0
"aouda , leaning upon mr . fogg 's arm , observed the tumultuous scene with surprise , while fix asked a man near him what the cause of it all was . before the man could reply , a fresh agitation arose ; hurrahs and excited shouts were heard ; the staffs of the banners began to be used as offensive weapons ; and fists flew about in every direction . thumps were exchanged from the tops of the carriages and omnibuses which had been blocked up in the crowd . boots and shoes went whirling through the air , and mr . fogg thought he even heard the crack of revolvers mingling in the din , the rout approached the stairway , and flowed over the lower step . one of the parties had evidently been repulsed ; but the mere lookers - on could not tell whether mandiboy or camerfield had gained the upper hand .",76
"they were determined to follow top , wherever the intelligent animal wished to lead them .",5
"it was difficult to fancy that any human creature had ever passed there , but yet top went backward and forward , not like a dog who searches at random , but like a dog being endowed with a mind , who is following up an idea .",16
in about seven or eight minutes top stopped in a glade surrounded with tall trees .,6
"at this moment , top became very excited .",4
""" what is the matter , top ? "" said cyrus harding .",6
"top barked louder , bounding about at the foot of a gigantic pine .",0
"and he slipped an open clasp knife under my clothes , slitting them from top to bottom with one swift stroke . then he briskly undressed me while i swam for us both .",14
"a square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall , approached by a double stair . from this central point two long corridors extended the whole length of the building , from which all the bedrooms opened . my own was in the same wing as baskerville 's and almost next door to it . these rooms appeared to be much more modern than the central part of the house , and the bright paper and numerous candles did something to remove the sombre impression which our arrival had left upon my mind .",7
"after a strained moment of silence , he leaned across and said , very quietly , but watching the effect of each word upon the face of him he had sent for , "" alan , in a locked room at the top of this house , a room to which nobody but myself has access , a dead man is seated at a table . he has been dead ten hours now . do n't stir , and do n't look at me like that . who the man is , why he died , how he died , are matters that do not concern you . what you have to do is this-- """,42

"_ dec _ . 11.—this day i went to work with it accordingly , and got two shores or posts pitched upright to the top , with two pieces of boards across over each post ; this i finished the next day ; and setting more posts up with boards , in about a week more i had the roof secured , and the posts , standing in rows , served me for partitions to part off the house .",24

"after that , who knows if jup and top had not themselves their little dream of the future .",8
"cyrus harding had nothing but the two steel blades from top 's collar , and yet he was so clever , and his companions aided him with so much intelligence , that three days afterwards the little colony 's stock of tools was augmented by a blowing - machine , destined to inject the air into the midst of the ore when it should be subjected to heat -- an indispensable condition to the success of the operation .",10

"malaysians , who do a booming business in these birds with the chinese , have various methods for catching them that we could n't use . sometimes they set snares on the tops of the tall trees that the bird of paradise prefers to inhabit . at other times they capture it with a tenacious glue that paralyzes its movements . they will even go so far as to poison the springs where these fowl habitually drink . but in our case , all we could do was fire at them on the wing , which left us little chance of getting one . and in truth , we used up a good part of our ammunition in vain .",32

"after crossing a few narrow streets where some convicts , in trousers half yellow and half grey , were at work under the orders of the gangers , we arrived at the vor frelsers kirk . there was nothing remarkable about the church ; but there was a reason why its tall spire had attracted the professor 's attention . starting from the top of the tower , an external staircase wound around the spire , the spirals circling up into the sky .",63

""" this was the first point gained . i then walked slowly down the garden path , which happened to be composed of a clay soil , peculiarly suitable for taking impressions . no doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush , but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning . there is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps . happily , i have always laid great stress upon it , and much practice has made it second nature to me . i saw the heavy footmarks of the constables , but i saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden . it was easy to tell that they had been before the others , because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them . in this way my second link was formed , which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number , one remarkable for his height ( as i calculated from the length of his stride ) , and the other fashionably dressed , to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots .",161
""" top smells some amphibious creature , "" replied herbert .",1
"he hurried on towards the left , glancing back now and then to see if he was being followed . in about seven or eight minutes he reached a small shabby house that was wedged in between two gaunt factories . in one of the top - windows stood a lamp . he stopped and gave a peculiar knock .",45
"i must have walked like a somnambulist , without any knowledge of my steps , and top must have guided me here , after having dragged me from the waves ...",16
"come , top !",2
"meanwhile top had returned at his master 's call , and had regained the shore : but he could not stay quiet ; he plunged in among the tall grass , and guided by instinct , he appeared to follow some invisible being which was slipping along under the surface of the water .",1
"neb led top in a leash , to prevent him from bounding forward .",2
"where is top ? """,2
""" top is on before . """,1
"with this sublime conclusion , mr . brocklehurst adjusted the top button of his surtout , muttered something to his family , who rose , bowed to miss temple , and then all the great people sailed in state from the room .",10
"at the moment he opened the door , the three musketeers and d’artagnan , conducted by la chesnaye , appeared at the top of the staircase .",22
"alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list , feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like , ' --for they have n't got much evidence yet , ' she said to herself . imagine her surprise , when the white rabbit read out , at the top of his shrill little voice , the name ' alice ! '",54
"the colonists were about to begin to traverse the plateau to return to the chimneys , when top gave new signs of agitation .",17
"vain aspiration ! the west wind whispered in the ivy round me ; but no gentle ariel borrowed its breath as a medium of speech : the birds sang in the tree - tops ; but their song , however sweet , was inarticulate .",33
"gideon spilett and herbert went to take their share of the breakfast , leaving top to watch under the windows .",14
"they were foxes , but of a very large size , who uttered a sort of barking , at which top seemed to be very much astonished , for he stopped short in the chase , and gave the swift animals time to disappear .",20
"his master could do nothing to save him , and before gideon spilett or herbert thought of bending their bows , top , seized by the dugong , had disappeared beneath the water .",21
"neb , his iron - tipped spear in his hand , wished to go to top 's help , and attack the dangerous animal in its own element .",15
herbert much regretted that top had not been able to catch one of these carnivora .,4
"meanwhile , a struggle was going on beneath the water , an inexplicable struggle , for in his situation top could not possibly resist ; and judging by the bubbling of the surface it must be also a terrible struggle , and could not but terminate in the death of the dog !",19
"but suddenly , in the middle of a foaming circle , top reappeared .",11
"i 'll mention chiefly some trunkfish unique to the red sea , the sea of the east indies , and that part of the ocean washing the coasts of equinoctial america . like turtles , armadillos , sea urchins , and crustaceans , these fish are protected by armor plate that 's neither chalky nor stony but actual bone . sometimes this armor takes the shape of a solid triangle , sometimes that of a solid quadrangle . among the triangular type , i noticed some half a decimeter long , with brown tails , yellow fins , and wholesome , exquisitely tasty flesh ; i even recommend that they be acclimatized to fresh water , a change , incidentally , that a number of saltwater fish can make with ease . i 'll also mention some quadrangular trunkfish topped by four large protuberances along the back ; trunkfish sprinkled with white spots on the underside of the body , which make good house pets like certain birds ; boxfish armed with stings formed by extensions of their bony crusts , and whose odd grunting has earned them the nickname "" sea pigs "" ; then some trunkfish known as dromedaries , with tough , leathery flesh and big conical humps .",139
"among other fowl i noted some sheathbills from the wading - bird family , the size of pigeons , white in color , the beak short and conical , the eyes framed by red circles . conseil laid in a supply of them , because when they 're properly cooked , these winged creatures make a pleasant dish . in the air there passed sooty albatross with four - meter wingspans , birds aptly dubbed "" vultures of the ocean , "" also gigantic petrels including several with arching wings , enthusiastic eaters of seal that are known as quebrantahuesos , and cape pigeons , a sort of small duck , the tops of their bodies black and white -- in short , a whole series of petrels , some whitish with wings trimmed in brown , others blue and exclusive to these antarctic seas , the former "" so oily , "" i told conseil , "" that inhabitants of the faroe islands simply fit the bird with a wick , then light it up . """,112
"the great question certainly was , what ? alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass , but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances . there was a large mushroom growing near her , about the same height as herself ; and when she had looked under it , and on both sides of it , and behind it , it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it .",93
"in the midst of the watery mass , brightly lit by our electric beams , there snaked past those one - meter lampreys that are common to nearly every clime . a type of ray from the genus oxyrhynchus , five feet wide , had a white belly with a spotted , ash - gray back and was carried along by the currents like a huge , wide - open shawl . other rays passed by so quickly i could n't tell if they deserved that name "" eagle ray "" coined by the ancient greeks , or those designations of "" rat ray , "" "" bat ray , "" and "" toad ray "" that modern fishermen have inflicted on them . dogfish known as topes , twelve feet long and especially feared by divers , were racing with each other . looking like big bluish shadows , thresher sharks went by , eight feet long and gifted with an extremely acute sense of smell . dorados from the genus sparus , some measuring up to thirteen decimeters , appeared in silver and azure costumes encircled with ribbons , which contrasted with the dark color of their fins ; fish sacred to the goddess venus , their eyes set in brows of gold ; a valuable species that patronizes all waters fresh or salt , equally at home in rivers , lakes , and oceans , living in every clime , tolerating any temperature , their line dating back to prehistoric times on this earth yet preserving all its beauty from those far - off days . magnificent sturgeons , nine to ten meters long and extremely fast , banged their powerful tails against the glass of our panels , showing bluish backs with small brown spots ; they resemble sharks , without equaling their strength , and are encountered in every sea ; in the spring they delight in swimming up the great rivers , fighting the currents of the volga , danube , po , rhine , loire , and oder , while feeding on herring , mackerel , salmon , and codfish ; although they belong to the class of cartilaginous fish , they rate as a delicacy ; they 're eaten fresh , dried , marinated , or salt - preserved , and in olden times they were borne in triumph to the table of the roman epicure lucullus . but whenever the nautilus drew near the surface , those denizens of the mediterranean i could observe most productively belonged to the sixty - third genus of bony fish . these were tuna from the genus scomber , blue - black on top , silver on the belly armor , their dorsal stripes giving off a golden gleam . they are said to follow ships in search of refreshing shade from the hot tropical sun , and they did just that with the nautilus , as they had once done with the vessels of the count de la pérouse . for long hours they competed in speed with our submersible . i could n't stop marveling at these animals so perfectly cut out for racing , their heads small , their bodies sleek , spindle - shaped , and in some cases over three meters long , their pectoral fins gifted with remarkable strength , their caudal fins forked . like certain flocks of birds , whose speed they equal , these tuna swim in triangle formation , which prompted the ancients to say they 'd boned up on geometry and military strategy . and yet they ca n't escape the provençal fishermen , who prize them as highly as did the ancient inhabitants of turkey and italy ; and these valuable animals , as oblivious as if they were deaf and blind , leap right into the marseilles tuna nets and perish by the thousands .",448
"she stretched herself up on tiptoe , and peeped over the edge of the mushroom , and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar , that was sitting on the top with its arms folded , quietly smoking a long hookah , and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else .",32
"for some reason or other , the house was crowded that night , and the fat jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear to ear with an oily tremulous smile . he escorted them to their box with a sort of pompous humility , waving his fat jewelled hands and talking at the top of his voice . dorian gray loathed him more than ever . he felt as if he had come to look for miranda and had been met by caliban . lord henry , upon the other hand , rather liked him . at least he declared he did , and insisted on shaking him by the hand and assuring him that he was proud to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone bankrupt over a poet .",58
