"was phileas fogg rich ? undoubtedly . but those who knew him best could not imagine how he had made his fortune , and mr . fogg was the last person to whom to apply for the information . he was not lavish , nor , on the contrary , avaricious ; for , whenever he knew that money was needed for a noble , useful , or benevolent purpose , he supplied it quietly and sometimes anonymously . he was , in short , the least communicative of men . he talked very little , and seemed all the more mysterious for his taciturn manner . his daily habits were quite open to observation ; but whatever he did was so exactly the same thing that he had always done before , that the wits of the curious were fairly puzzled .",72

"by december 15 we had left the alluring society islands in the west , likewise elegant tahiti , queen of the pacific . in the morning i spotted this island 's lofty summits a few miles to leeward . its waters supplied excellent fish for the tables on board : mackerel , bonito , albacore , and a few varieties of that sea serpent named the moray eel .",41

"mr . fogg 's wardrobe was amply supplied and in the best taste . each pair of trousers , coat , and vest bore a number , indicating the time of year and season at which they were in turn to be laid out for wearing ; and the same system was applied to the master 's shoes .",7

"i would have been deeply interested in visiting this long , 360-league reef , against which the ever - surging sea broke with the fearsome intensity of thunderclaps . but just then the nautilus 's slanting fins took us to great depths , and i could see nothing of those high coral walls . i had to rest content with the various specimens of fish brought up by our nets . among others i noted some long - finned albacore , a species in the genus scomber , as big as tuna , bluish on the flanks , and streaked with crosswise stripes that disappear when the animal dies . these fish followed us in schools and supplied our table with very dainty flesh . we also caught a large number of yellow - green gilthead , half a decimeter long and tasting like dorado , plus some flying gurnards , authentic underwater swallows that , on dark nights , alternately streak air and water with their phosphorescent glimmers . among mollusks and zoophytes , i found in our trawl 's meshes various species of alcyonarian coral , sea urchins , hammer shells , spurred - star shells , wentletrap snails , horn shells , glass snails . the local flora was represented by fine floating algae : sea tangle , and kelp from the genus macrocystis , saturated with the mucilage their pores perspire , from which i selected a wonderful nemastoma geliniaroidea , classifying it with the natural curiosities in the museum .",117

"after the works of art , natural rarities predominated . they consisted chiefly of plants , shells , and other exhibits from the ocean that must have been captain nemo 's own personal finds . in the middle of the lounge , a jet of water , electrically lit , fell back into a basin made from a single giant clam . the delicately festooned rim of this shell , supplied by the biggest mollusk in the class acephala , measured about six meters in circumference ; so it was even bigger than those fine giant clams given to king fran√ßois i by the republic of venice , and which the church of saint - sulpice in paris has made into two gigantic holy - water fonts .",70

"the perimeter of the corral was then traced by the engineer , and they would then have proceeded to fell the trees necessary for the construction of the palisade , but as the opening up of the road had already necessitated the sacrifice of a considerable number , those were brought and supplied a hundred stakes , which were firmly fixed in the ground .",52

"this incident did not interrupt our walk . for two hours we were sometimes led over plains of sand , sometimes over prairies of seaweed that were quite arduous to cross . in all honesty , i was dead tired by the time i spotted a hazy glow half a mile away , cutting through the darkness of the waters . it was the nautilus 's beacon . within twenty minutes we would be on board , and there i could breathe easy again -- because my tank 's current air supply seemed to be quite low in oxygen . but i was reckoning without an encounter that slightly delayed our arrival .",91
"here a question popped into my head . how did the commander of this aquatic residence go about it ? did he obtain air using chemical methods , releasing the oxygen contained in potassium chlorate by heating it , meanwhile absorbing the carbon dioxide with potassium hydroxide ? if so , he would have to keep up some kind of relationship with the shore , to come by the materials needed for such an operation . did he simply limit himself to storing the air in high - pressure tanks and then dispense it according to his crew 's needs ? perhaps . or , proceeding in a more convenient , more economical , and consequently more probable fashion , was he satisfied with merely returning to breathe at the surface of the water like a cetacean , renewing his oxygen supply every twenty - four hours ? in any event , whatever his method was , it seemed prudent to me that he use this method without delay .",141

"all in all , we enjoyed a highly satisfactory state of health . the diet on board agreed with us perfectly , and for my part , i could easily have gone without those changes of pace that ned land , in a spirit of protest , kept taxing his ingenuity to supply us . what 's more , in this constant temperature we did n't even have to worry about catching colds . besides , the ship had a good stock of the madrepore dendrophylia , known in provence by the name sea fennel , and a poultice made from the dissolved flesh of its polyps will furnish an excellent cough medicine .",52
"accordingly , our speed was twenty - five miles ( that is , twelve four - kilometer leagues ) per hour . needless to say , ned land had to give up his escape plans , much to his distress . swept along at the rate of twelve to thirteen meters per second , he could hardly make use of the skiff . leaving the nautilus under these conditions would have been like jumping off a train racing at this speed , a rash move if there ever was one . moreover , to renew our air supply , the submersible rose to the surface of the waves only at night , and relying solely on compass and log , it steered by dead reckoning .",97
