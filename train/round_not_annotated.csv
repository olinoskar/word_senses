"no ; that was impossible . hour by hour , and week by week , the thing upon the canvas was growing old . it might escape the hideousness of sin , but the hideousness of age was in store for it . the cheeks would become hollow or flaccid . yellow crow 's feet would creep round the fading eyes and make them horrible . the hair would lose its brightness , the mouth would gape or droop , would be foolish or gross , as the mouths of old men are . there would be the wrinkled throat , the cold , blue - veined hands , the twisted body , that he remembered in the grandfather who had been so stern to him in his boyhood . the picture had to be concealed . there was no help for it .",57
""" bring it in , mr . hubbard , please , "" he said , wearily , turning round . "" i am sorry i kept you so long . i was thinking of something else . """,18
"dorian started . "" it would not interest you , mr . hubbard , "" he said , keeping his eye on the man . he felt ready to leap upon him and fling him to the ground if he dared to lift the gorgeous hanging that concealed the secret of his life .

"he sighed , and having poured himself out some tea , opened lord henry 's note . it was simply to say that he sent him round the evening paper , and a book that might interest him , and that he would be at the club at eight - fifteen . he opened the st . james 's languidly , and looked through it . a red pencil - mark on the fifth page caught his eye . it drew attention to the following paragraph :",26
"then she cried , "" ahem ! "" under cover of the mea culpa , striking her breast so vigorously that everybody , even the lady with the red cushion , turned round toward her . porthos paid no attention . nevertheless , he understood it all , but was deaf .",32
"when she was only about three steps from him , he turned his head round , fixing his eyes steadfastly upon the lady with the red cushion , who had risen and was approaching , followed by her black boy and her woman .",14
"they certainly were not . they were of a pearly grey colour , small , round , and almost transparent against the light . "" from their lightness and transparency , i should imagine that they are soluble in water , "" i remarked .",15
"there he was , sure enough , a small urchin with a little bundle upon his shoulder , toiling slowly up the hill . when he reached the crest i saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant against the cold blue sky . he looked round him with a furtive and stealthy air , as one who dreads pursuit . then he vanished over the hill .",47
"the head of my bed was near the door , and i thought at first the goblin - laugher stood at my bedside -- or rather , crouched by my pillow : but i rose , looked round , and could see nothing ; while , as i still gazed , the unnatural sound was reiterated : and i knew it came from behind the panels .",37
"tongues of flame darted round the bed : the curtains were on fire . in the midst of blaze and vapour , mr . rochester lay stretched motionless , in deep sleep .",4
"for a minute i stood there with the paper in my hands thinking out the meaning of this curt message . it was i , then , and not sir henry , who was being dogged by this secret man . he had not followed me himself , but he had set an agent -- the boy , perhaps -- upon my track , and this was his report . possibly i had taken no step since i had been upon the moor which had not been observed and reported . always there was this feeling of an unseen force , a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and delicacy , holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme moment that one realized that one was indeed entangled in its meshes .",105
"if there was one report there might be others , so i looked round the hut in search of them . there was no trace , however , of anything of the kind , nor could i discover any sign which might indicate the character or intentions of the man who lived in this singular place , save that he must be of spartan habits and cared little for the comforts of life . when i thought of the heavy rains and looked at the gaping roof i understood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that inhospitable abode . was he our malignant enemy , or was he by chance our guardian angel ? i swore that i would not leave the hut until i knew .",13
"however , instead of returning on board as might have been expected , the boat coasted along the islet , so as to round its southern point .",23

"i did run ; i brought the candle which still remained in the gallery . he took it from my hand , held it up , and surveyed the bed , all blackened and scorched , the sheets drenched , the carpet round swimming in water .",42
"he turned round . "" what i have to say is this , "" he cried . "" you must give me some answer to these horrible charges that are made against you . if you tell me that they are absolutely untrue from beginning to end , i shall believe you . deny them , dorian , deny them ! ca n't you see what i am going through ? my god ! do n't tell me that you are bad , and corrupt , and shameful .

"hallward glanced round him with a puzzled expression . the room looked as if it had not been lived in for years . a faded flemish tapestry , a curtained picture , an old italian cassone , and an almost empty book - case -- that was all that it seemed to contain , besides a chair and a table . as dorian gray was lighting a half - burned candle that was standing on the mantelshelf , he saw that the whole place was covered with dust and that the carpet was in holes . a mouse ran scuffling behind the wainscoting . there was a damp odour of mildew .",2

"blindly we ran through the gloom , blundering against boulders , forcing our way through gorse bushes , panting up hills and rushing down slopes , heading always in the direction whence those dreadful sounds had come . at every rise holmes looked eagerly round him , but the shadows were thick upon the moor , and nothing moved upon its dreary face .",44

"felton cast his eyes round for means of escape , and seeing the door free , he rushed into the next chamber , in which , as we have said , the deputies from la rochelle were waiting , crossed it as quickly as possible , and rushed toward the staircase ; but upon the first step he met lord de winter , who , seeing him pale , confused , livid , and stained with blood both on his hands and face , seized him by the throat , crying , "" i knew it ! i guessed it !",4

"a groan broke from campbell 's lips and he shivered all over . the ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece seemed to him to be dividing time into separate atoms of agony , each of which was too terrible to be borne . he felt as if an iron ring was being slowly tightened round his forehead , as if the disgrace with which he was threatened had already come upon him . the hand upon his shoulder weighed like a hand of lead . it was intolerable . it seemed to crush him .",55

"there he stopped , feeling afraid to turn round , and his eyes fixed themselves on the intricacies of the pattern before him . he heard campbell bringing in the heavy chest , and the irons , and the other things that he had required for his dreadful work . he began to wonder if he and basil hallward had ever met , and , if so , what they had thought of each other .",8

"this current swept along with it a whole host of moving creatures . argonauts , so common in the mediterranean , voyaged here in schools of large numbers . among cartilaginous fish , the most remarkable were rays whose ultra slender tails made up nearly a third of the body , which was shaped like a huge diamond twenty - five feet long ; then little one - meter sharks , the head large , the snout short and rounded , the teeth sharp and arranged in several rows , the body seemingly covered with scales .",79

"the prediction of the mormon was only too well fulfilled . whether it was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which she had been forced , poor lucy never held up her head again , but pined away and died within a month . her sottish husband , who had married her principally for the sake of john ferrier 's property , did not affect any great grief at his bereavement ; but his other wives mourned over her , and sat up with her the night before the burial , as is the mormon custom . they were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning , when , to their inexpressible fear and astonishment , the door was flung open , and a savage - looking , weather - beaten man in tattered garments strode into the room . without a glance or a word to the cowering women , he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of lucy ferrier . stooping over her , he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead , and then , snatching up her hand , he took the wedding - ring from her finger . "" she shall not be buried in that , "" he cried with a fierce snarl , and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone . so strange and so brief was the episode , that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it , had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared .",108
"gregson and lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this proposition rather a bold one ; but holmes at once took the prisoner at his word , and loosened the towel which we had bound round his ancles . he rose and stretched his legs , as though to assure himself that they were free once more . i remember that i thought to myself , as i eyed him , that i had seldom seen a more powerfully built man ; and his dark sunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was as formidable as his personal strength .",35

"it was a magnificent sea otter from the genus enhydra , the only exclusively marine quadruped . one and a half meters long , this otter had to be worth a good high price . its coat , chestnut brown above and silver below , would have made one of those wonderful fur pieces so much in demand in the russian and chinese markets ; the fineness and luster of its pelt guaranteed that it would go for at least 2,000 francs . i was full of wonderment at this unusual mammal , with its circular head adorned by short ears , its round eyes , its white whiskers like those on a cat , its webbed and clawed feet , its bushy tail . hunted and trapped by fishermen , this valuable carnivore has become extremely rare , and it takes refuge chiefly in the northernmost parts of the pacific , where in all likelihood its species will soon be facing extinction .",103

"suddenly he started . his eyes grew strangely bright , and he gnawed nervously at his underlip . between two of the windows stood a large florentine cabinet , made out of ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue lapis . he watched it as though it were a thing that could fascinate and make afraid , as though it held something that he longed for and yet almost loathed . his breath quickened . a mad craving came over him . he lit a cigarette and then threw it away . his eyelids drooped till the long fringed lashes almost touched his cheek . but he still watched the cabinet . at last he got up from the sofa on which he had been lying , went over to it , and having unlocked it , touched some hidden spring . a triangular drawer passed slowly out . his fingers moved instinctively towards it , dipped in , and closed on something . it was a small chinese box of black and gold - dust lacquer , elaborately wrought , the sides patterned with curved waves , and the silken cords hung with round crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads . he opened it . inside was a green paste , waxy in lustre , the odour curiously heavy and persistent .",194
"they dispersed about the room , reminding me , by the lightness and buoyancy of their movements , of a flock of white plumy birds . some of them threw themselves in half - reclining positions on the sofas and ottomans : some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books : the rest gathered in a group round the fire : all talked in a low but clear tone which seemed habitual to them .",60

"a cold rain began to fall , and the blurred street - lamps looked ghastly in the dripping mist . the public- houses were just closing , and dim men and women were clustering in broken groups round their doors . from some of the bars came the sound of horrible laughter . in others , drunkards brawled and screamed .",37
"dorian started and peered round . "" this will do , "" he answered , and having got out hastily and given the driver the extra fare he had promised him , he walked quickly in the direction of the quay . here and there a lantern gleamed at the stern of some huge merchantman . the light shook and splintered in the puddles . a red glare came from an outward - bound steamer that was coaling . the slimy pavement looked like a wet mackintosh .",4
"arrived at the bastion , the four friends turned round .",9
"dorian winced and looked round at the grotesque things that lay in such fantastic postures on the ragged mattresses . the twisted limbs , the gaping mouths , the staring lustreless eyes , fascinated him . he knew in what strange heavens they were suffering , and what dull hells were teaching them the secret of some new joy . they were better off than he was . he was prisoned in thought . memory , like a horrible malady , was eating his soul away . from time to time he seemed to see the eyes of basil hallward looking at him . yet he felt he could not stay . the presence of adrian singleton troubled him . he wanted to be where no one would know who he was . he wanted to escape from himself .",4

"alice was not a bit hurt , and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment : she looked up , but it was all dark overhead ; before her was another long passage , and the white rabbit was still in sight , hurrying down it . there was not a moment to be lost : away went alice like the wind , and was just in time to hear it say , as it turned a corner , ' oh my ears and whiskers , how late it 's getting ! ' she was close behind it when she turned the corner , but the rabbit was no longer to be seen : she found herself in a long , low hall , which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof . there were doors all round the hall , but they were all locked ; and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other , trying every door , she walked sadly down the middle , wondering how she was ever to get out again .",145
"besides this , i arrived at an unexpected perfection in my earthenware , and contrived well enough to make them with a wheel , which i found infinitely easier and better ; because i made things round and shaped , which before were filthy things indeed to look on . but i think i was never more vain of my own performance , or more joyful for anything i found out , than for my being able to make a tobacco - pipe ; and though it was a very ugly , clumsy thing when it was done , and only burned red , like other earthenware , yet as it was hard and firm , and would draw the smoke , i was exceedingly comforted with it , for i had been always used to smoke ; and there were pipes in the ship , but i forgot them at first , not thinking there was tobacco in the island ; and afterwards , when i searched the ship again , i could not come at any pipes .",36
"suddenly she came upon a little three - legged table , all made of solid glass ; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key , and alice 's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall ; but , alas ! either the locks were too large , or the key was too small , but at any rate it would not open any of them . however , on the second time round , she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before , and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high : she tried the little golden key in the lock , and to her great delight it fitted !",83
"alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage , not much larger than a rat - hole : she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw . how she longed to get out of that dark hall , and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains , but she could not even get her head though the doorway ; ' and even if my head would go through , ' thought poor alice , ' it would be of very little use without my shoulders . oh , how i wish i could shut up like a telescope ! i think i could , if i only know how to begin . ' for , you see , so many out - of - the - way things had happened lately , that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible . there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door , so she went back to the table , half hoping she might find another key on it , or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes : this time she found a little bottle on it , ( ' which certainly was not here before , ' said alice , ) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label , with the words ' drink me ' beautifully printed on it in large letters .",235

"' you ought to be ashamed of yourself , ' said alice , ' a great girl like you , ' ( she might well say this ) , ' to go on crying in this way ! stop this moment , i tell you !
