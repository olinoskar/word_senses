"fix did not have the same thoughts , and could scarcely conceal his agitation . he walked feverishly up and down the platform , but soon resumed his outward composure . he now saw the folly of which he had been guilty in letting fogg go alone . what ! this man , whom he had just followed around the world , was permitted now to separate himself from him ! he began to accuse and abuse himself , and , as if he were director of police , administered to himself a sound lecture for his greenness .",22
"the traps were besides extremely simple ; being pits dug in the ground , a platform of branches and grass above , which concealed the opening , and at the bottom some bait , the scent of which would attract animals .",15
""" indeed . that is very interesting . well , good - bye , "" he added as the train began to glide down the platform . "" bear in mind , sir henry , one of the phrases in that queer old legend which dr . mortimer has read to us , and avoid the moor in those hours of darkness when the powers of evil are exalted .

"this projection , carefully leveled by the pickaxe , made a sort of platform , to which they fixed the first ladder , of which the oscillation was thus diminished one - half , and a rope permitted it to be raised to the level of granite house .",13

"passepartout , about nine o'clock , went out upon the platform to take the air . the weather was cold , the heavens grey , but it was not snowing . the sun 's disc , enlarged by the mist , seemed an enormous ring of gold , and passepartout was amusing himself by calculating its value in pounds sterling , when he was diverted from this interesting study by a strange - looking personage who made his appearance on the platform .",10

"trains , like time and tide , stop for no one . the gentleman who uttered the cries was evidently a belated mormon . he was breathless with running . happily for him , the station had neither gates nor barriers . he rushed along the track , jumped on the rear platform of the train , and fell , exhausted , into one of the seats .",52
"just then the chief officer drew the captain 's attention anew . the latter interrupted his strolling and aimed his spyglass at the point indicated . he observed it a good while . as for me , deeply puzzled , i went below to the lounge and brought back an excellent long - range telescope i habitually used . leaning my elbows on the beacon housing , which jutted from the stern of the platform , i got set to scour that whole stretch of sky and sea . but no sooner had i peered into the eyepiece than the instrument was snatched from my hands .",74
"i then considered leaving my stateroom . was i free or still a prisoner ? perfectly free . i opened my door , headed down the gangways , and climbed the central companionway . hatches that had been closed the day before were now open . i arrived on the platform .",50

"meanwhile preparations for this daring attempt were getting under way . the nautilus 's powerful pumps forced air down into the tanks and stored it under high pressure . near four o'clock captain nemo informed me that the platform hatches were about to be closed . i took a last look at the dense ice bank we were going to conquer . the weather was fair , the skies reasonably clear , the cold quite brisk , namely -12 degrees centigrade ; but after the wind had lulled , this temperature did n't seem too unbearable .",38
