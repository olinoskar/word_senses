"having breakfasted , mr . fogg and his companions resumed their places in the car , and observed the varied landscape which unfolded itself as they passed along the vast prairies , the mountains lining the horizon , and the creeks , with their frothy , foaming streams . sometimes a great herd of buffaloes , massing together in the distance , seemed like a moveable dam . these innumerable multitudes of ruminating beasts often form an insurmountable obstacle to the passage of the trains ; thousands of them have been seen passing over the track for hours together , in compact ranks . the locomotive is then forced to stop and wait till the road is once more clear .",115
