"but this hypothesis of a war machine collapsed in the face of formal denials from the various governments . since the public interest was at stake and transoceanic travel was suffering , the sincerity of these governments could not be doubted . besides , how could the assembly of this underwater boat have escaped public notice ? keeping a secret under such circumstances would be difficult enough for an individual , and certainly impossible for a nation whose every move is under constant surveillance by rival powers .",30

"here is what those circumstances entailed . two miles to starboard lay gueboroa island , its coastline curving north to west like an immense arm . to the south and east , heads of coral were already on display , left uncovered by the ebbing waters . we had run aground at full tide and in one of those seas whose tides are moderate , an inconvenient state of affairs for floating the nautilus off . however , the ship had n't suffered in any way , so solidly joined was its hull . but although it could neither sink nor split open , it was in serious danger of being permanently attached to these reefs , and that would have been the finish of captain nemo 's submersible .",82
