"but the picture ? what was he to say of that ? it held the secret of his life , and told his story . it had taught him to love his own beauty . would it teach him to loathe his own soul ? would he ever look at it again ?","('picture', 'tableau', 'cuadrar')",0,2,1
"he drew the screen back into its former place in front of the picture , smiling as he did so , and passed into his bedroom , where his valet was already waiting for him . an hour later he was at the opera , and lord henry was leaning over his chair .","('picture', 'tableau', 'cuadrar')",0,13,1

"it was possible , i reflected , that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene , of the details of the picture , would be sufficient to modify , or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression ; and , acting upon this idea , i reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling , and gazed down — but with a shudder even more thrilling than before — upon the remodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge , and the ghastly tree - stems , and the vacant and eye - like windows .","('picture', 'tableau', 'cuadrar')",1,24,1

"he wondered if he had met the men in the hall as they were leaving the house and had wormed out of them what they had been doing . he would be sure to miss the picture -- had no doubt missed it already , while he had been laying the tea - things . the screen had not been set back , and a blank space was visible on the wall . perhaps some night he might find him creeping upstairs and trying to force the door of the room . it was a horrible thing to have a spy in one 's house . he had heard of rich men who had been blackmailed all their lives by some servant who had read a letter , or overheard a conversation , or picked up a card with an address , or found beneath a pillow a withered flower or a shred of crumpled lace .","('picture', 'tableau', 'cuadrar')",1,36,1

"hallward glanced round him with a puzzled expression . the room looked as if it had not been lived in for years . a faded flemish tapestry , a curtained picture , an old italian cassone , and an almost empty book - case -- that was all that it seemed to contain , besides a chair and a table . as dorian gray was lighting a half - burned candle that was standing on the mantelshelf , he saw that the whole place was covered with dust and that the carpet was in holes . a mouse ran scuffling behind the wainscoting . there was a damp odour of mildew .","('picture', 'tableau', 'cuadrar')",1,30,1
"it was some foul parody , some infamous ignoble satire . he had never done that . still , it was his own picture . he knew it , and he felt as if his blood had changed in a moment from fire to sluggish ice . his own picture ! what did it mean ? why had it altered ? he turned and looked at dorian gray with the eyes of a sick man . his mouth twitched , and his parched tongue seemed unable to articulate . he passed his hand across his forehead . it was dank with clammy sweat .","('picture', 'tableau', 'cuadrar')",1,49,1
