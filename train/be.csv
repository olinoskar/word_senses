"so reasoned the detective , while the hours crept by all too slowly . he did not know what to do . sometimes he was tempted to tell aouda all ; but he could not doubt how the young woman would receive his confidences . what course should he take ? he thought of pursuing fogg across the vast white plains ; it did not seem impossible that he might overtake him . footsteps were easily printed on the snow ! but soon , under a new sheet , every imprint would be effaced .",74,"('be', 'être', 'estar')",1

"several hours passed . the weather was dismal , and it was very cold . fix sat motionless on a bench in the station ; he might have been thought asleep . aouda , despite the storm , kept coming out of the waiting - room , going to the end of the platform , and peering through the tempest of snow , as if to pierce the mist which narrowed the horizon around her , and to hear , if possible , some welcome sound . she heard and saw nothing . then she would return , chilled through , to issue out again after the lapse of a few moments , but always in vain .",6,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0

"the captain , who was really alarmed , did not know what course to take . should he send another detachment to the rescue of the first ? should he sacrifice more men , with so few chances of saving those already sacrificed ? his hesitation did not last long , however . calling one of his lieutenants , he was on the point of ordering a reconnaissance , when gunshots were heard . was it a signal ? the soldiers rushed out of the fort , and half a mile off they perceived a little band returning in good order .",74,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0

"these were the only words he uttered during the journey . aouda , cosily packed in furs and cloaks , was sheltered as much as possible from the attacks of the freezing wind . as for passepartout , his face was as red as the sun 's disc when it sets in the mist , and he laboriously inhaled the biting air . with his natural buoyancy of spirits , he began to hope again . they would reach new york on the evening , if not on the morning , of the 11th , and there was still some chances that it would be before the steamer sailed for liverpool .",20,"('be', 'être', 'estar')",1

"this was a misfortune . mr . fogg , in order not to deviate from his course , furled his sails and increased the force of the steam ; but the vessel 's speed slackened , owing to the state of the sea , the long waves of which broke against the stern . she pitched violently , and this retarded her progress . the breeze little by little swelled into a tempest , and it was to be feared that the henrietta might not be able to maintain herself upright on the waves .",1,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0

the political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were extensive .,11,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0

"moreover , its port was the last in the kingdom of france open to the english , and by closing it against england , our eternal enemy , the cardinal completed the work of joan of arc and the duc de guise .",4,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"it was , then , richelieu ’s object , not only to get rid of an enemy of france , but to avenge himself on a rival ; but this vengeance must be grand and striking and worthy in every way of a man who held in his hand , as his weapon for combat , the forces of a kingdom .",32,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"on his side buckingham , in pretending to maintain the honor of england , was moved by interests exactly like those of the cardinal . buckingham also was pursuing a private vengeance . buckingham could not under any pretense be admitted into france as an ambassador ; he wished to enter it as a conqueror .",14,"('be', 'être', 'estar')",1
"it resulted from this that the real stake in this game , which two most powerful kingdoms played for the good pleasure of two amorous men , was simply a kind look from anne of austria .",27,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"the first advantage had been gained by buckingham . arriving unexpectedly in sight of the isle of re with ninety vessels and nearly twenty thousand men , he had surprised the comte de toiras , who commanded for the king in the isle , and he had , after a bloody conflict , effected his landing .",4,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0

"now , whenever the king halted , the musketeers halted . it followed that d’artagnan , who was as yet purely and simply in the guards , found himself , for the time at least , separated from his good friends -- athos , porthos , and aramis . this separation , which was no more than an unpleasant circumstance , would have certainly become a cause of serious uneasiness if he had been able to guess by what unknown dangers he was surrounded .",17,"('be', 'être', 'estar')",1
"his reflections were not very cheerful . from the time of his arrival in paris , he had been mixed up with public affairs ; but his own private affairs had made no great progress , either in love or fortune .",2,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0

"that man had the power to crush him , and yet he had not done so . for a mind so perspicuous as that of d’artagnan , this indulgence was a light by which he caught a glimpse of a better future .",29,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"then he had made himself another enemy , less to be feared , he thought ; but nevertheless , he instinctively felt , not to be despised . this enemy was milady .",30,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"in exchange for all this , he had acquired the protection and good will of the queen ; but the favor of the queen was at the present time an additional cause of persecution , and her protection , as it was known , protected badly -- as witness chalais and mme . bonacieux .",24,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"what he had clearly gained in all this was the diamond , worth five or six thousand livres , which he wore on his finger ; and even this diamond -- supposing that d’artagnan , in his projects of ambition , wished to keep it , to make it someday a pledge for the gratitude of the queen -- had not in the meanwhile , since he could not part with it , more value than the gravel he trod under his feet .",8,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0

they knew all they wished to know ; the bastion was guarded .,10,"('be', 'être', 'estar')",1
"a longer stay in this dangerous spot would have been useless imprudence . d’artagnan and his two companions turned their backs , and commenced a retreat which resembled a flight .",9,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0

he quickly saw two heads appear above an abandoned work within thirty paces of him ; they were the heads of the two soldiers .,17,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0

"for some days the nautilus kept veering away from the american coast . it obviously did n't want to frequent the waves of the gulf of mexico or the caribbean sea . yet there was no shortage of water under its keel , since the average depth of these seas is 1,800 meters ; but these waterways , strewn with islands and plowed by steamers , probably did n't agree with captain nemo .",50,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0

"his reserve had been always excessive and habitual . i was aware , however , that his very ancient family had been noted , time out of mind , for a peculiar sensibility of temperament , displaying itself , through long ages , in many works of exalted art , and manifested , of late , in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity , as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies , perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognizable beauties , of musical science .",3,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0

"yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable . a cadaverousness of complexion ; an eye large , liquid , and luminous beyond comparison ; lips somewhat thin and very pallid , but of a surpassingly beautiful curve ; a nose of a delicate hebrew model , but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations ; a finely moulded chin , speaking , in its want of prominence , of a want of moral energy ; hair of a more than web - like softness and tenuity;—these features , with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple , made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten .",7,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"it was , he said , a constitutional and a family evil , and one for which he despaired to find a remedy — a mere nervous affection , he immediately added , which would undoubtedly soon pass off .",1,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"he was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted , and whence , for many years , he had never ventured forth — in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be re - stated — an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion had , by dint of long sufferance , he said , obtained over his spirit — an effect which the physique of the gray walls and turrets , and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down , had , at length , brought about upon the morale of his existence .",45,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0

"one of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend , partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction , may be shadowed forth , although feebly , in words . a small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel , with low walls , smooth , white , and without interruption or device .",20,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"it was , perhaps , the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar which gave birth , in great measure , to the fantastic character of the performances .",1,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0

"one favorite volume was a small octavo edition of the “ directorium inquisitorium , ” by the dominican eymeric de gironne ; and there were passages in pomponius mela , about the old african satyrs and œgipans , over which usher would sit dreaming for hours .",3,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"it had been used , apparently , in remote feudal times , for the worst purposes of a donjon - keep , and , in later days , as a place of deposit for powder , or some other highly combustible substance , as a portion of its floor , and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it , were carefully sheathed with copper .",64,"('be', 'être', 'estar')",1
"the disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth , had left , as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical character , the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face , and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death .",50,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0

"“ you must not — you shall not behold this ! ” said i , shuddering , to usher , as i led him , with a gentle violence , from the window to a seat . “ these appearances , which bewilder you , are merely electrical phenomena not uncommon — or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the tarn .",45,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0

"the antique volume which i had taken up was the “ mad trist ” of sir launcelot canning ; but i had called it a favorite of usher ’s more in sad jest than in earnest ; for , in truth , there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend .",8,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0

"his eyes were bent fixedly before him , and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity .",2,"('be', 'être', 'estar')",1
it was the work of the rushing gust — but then without those doors there did stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady madeline of usher .,1,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"so she was considering in her own mind ( as well as she could , for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid ) , whether the pleasure of making a daisy - chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies , when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her .",2,"('be', 'être', 'estar')",1
"suddenly she came upon a little three - legged table , all made of solid glass ; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key , and alice 's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall ; but , alas ! either the locks were too large , or the key was too small , but at any rate it would not open any of them . however , on the second time round , she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before , and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high : she tried the little golden key in the lock , and to her great delight it fitted !",61,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"it was all very well to say ' drink me , ' but the wise little alice was not going to do that in a hurry . ' no , i 'll look first , ' she said , ' and see whether it 's marked "" poison "" or not ' ; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt , and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things , all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them : such as , that a red - hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long ; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife , it usually bleeds ; and she had never forgotten that , if you drink much from a bottle marked ' poison , ' it is almost certain to disagree with you , sooner or later .",17,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"after a while , finding that nothing more happened , she decided on going into the garden at once ; but , alas for poor alice ! when she got to the door , she found she had forgotten the little golden key , and when she went back to the table for it , she found she could not possibly reach it : she could see it quite plainly through the glass , and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table , but it was too slippery ; and when she had tired herself out with trying , the poor little thing sat down and cried .",92,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance , and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming . it was the white rabbit returning , splendidly dressed , with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other : he came trotting along in a great hurry , muttering to himself as he came , ' oh ! the duchess , the duchess ! oh ! wo n't she be savage if i 've kept her waiting ! ' alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one ; so , when the rabbit came near her , she began , in a low , timid voice , ' if you please , sir-- ' the rabbit started violently , dropped the white kid gloves and the fan , and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go .",27,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"' i wish i had n't cried so much ! ' said alice , as she swam about , trying to find her way out . ' i shall be punished for it now , i suppose , by being drowned in my own tears ! that will be a queer thing , to be sure ! however , everything is queer to - day . '",60,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off , and she swam nearer to make out what it was : at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus , but then she remembered how small she was now , and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself .",24,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0

"' perhaps it does n't understand english , ' thought alice ; ' i daresay it 's a french mouse , come over with william the conqueror .

"it was high time to go , for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it : there were a duck and a dodo , a lory and an eaglet , and several other curious creatures . alice led the way , and the whole party swam to the shore .",1,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"' why , ' said the dodo , ' the best way to explain it is to do it . ' ( and , as you might like to try the thing yourself , some winter day , i will tell you how the dodo managed it . )",15,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0

"' he took me for his housemaid , ' she said to herself as she ran . ' how surprised he 'll be when he finds out who i am ! but i 'd better take him his fan and gloves -- that is , if i can find them . ' as she said this , she came upon a neat little house , on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name ' w. rabbit ' engraved upon it . she went in without knocking , and hurried upstairs , in great fear lest she should meet the real mary ann , and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves .",29,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"' mary ann ! mary ann ! ' said the voice . ' fetch me my gloves this moment ! ' then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs . alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her , and she trembled till she shook the house , quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit , and had no reason to be afraid of it .",35,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"presently the rabbit came up to the door , and tried to open it ; but , as the door opened inwards , and alice 's elbow was pressed hard against it , that attempt proved a failure . alice heard it say to itself ' then i 'll go round and get in at the window . '",27,"('be', 'être', 'estar')",1

"' oh ! so bill 's got to come down the chimney , has he ? ' said alice to herself . ' shy , they seem to put everything upon bill ! i would n't be in bill 's place for a good deal : this fireplace is narrow , to be sure ; but i think i can kick a little ! '",48,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"so she swallowed one of the cakes , and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly . as soon as she was small enough to get through the door , she ran out of the house , and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside . the poor little lizard , bill , was in the middle , being held up by two guinea - pigs , who were giving it something out of a bottle . they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared ; but she ran off as hard as she could , and soon found herself safe in a thick wood .",23,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0

"the great question certainly was , what ? alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass , but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances . there was a large mushroom growing near her , about the same height as herself ; and when she had looked under it , and on both sides of it , and behind it , it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it .",4,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation . alice replied , rather shyly , ' i -- i hardly know , sir , just at present-- at least i know who i was when i got up this morning , but i think i must have been changed several times since then . '",1,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation . alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillar 's making such very short remarks , and she drew herself up and said , very gravely , ' i think , you ought to tell me who you are , first . '",49,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"here was another puzzling question ; and as alice could not think of any good reason , and as the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind , she turned away .",1,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"' that is not said right , ' said the caterpillar .",2,"('be', 'être', 'estar')",1
the caterpillar was the first to speak .,2,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"' well , i should like to be a little larger , sir , if you would n't mind , ' said alice : ' three inches is such a wretched height to be . '",7,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0

"alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute , trying to make out which were the two sides of it ; and as it was perfectly round , she found this a very difficult question . however , at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go , and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand .",26,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"' come , my head 's free at last ! ' said alice in a tone of delight , which changed into alarm in another moment , when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found : all she could see , when she looked down , was an immense length of neck , which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her .",49,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
' i 'm not a serpent ! ' said alice indignantly . ' let me alone ! ',2,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0

"alice laughed so much at this , that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her ; and when she next peeped out the fish - footman was gone , and the other was sitting on the ground near the door , staring stupidly up into the sky .",39,"('be', 'être', 'estar')",1

"the door led right into a large kitchen , which was full of smoke from one end to the other : the duchess was sitting on a three - legged stool in the middle , nursing a baby ; the cook was leaning over the fire , stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup .",10,"('be', 'être', 'estar')",1
"there was certainly too much of it in the air . even the duchess sneezed occasionally ; and as for the baby , it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment 's pause . the only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze , were the cook , and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear .",46,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
"alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook , to see if she meant to take the hint ; but the cook was busily stirring the soup , and seemed not to be listening , so she went on again : ' twenty - four hours , i think ; or is it twelve ? i-- '",21,"('be', 'être', 'estar')",1
"no , there were no tears . ' if you 're going to turn into a pig , my dear , ' said alice , seriously , ' i 'll have nothing more to do with you . mind now !

"alice was just beginning to think to herself , ' now , what am i to do with this creature when i get it home ?

"he moved on as he spoke , and the dormouse followed him : the march hare moved into the dormouse 's place , and alice rather unwillingly took the place of the march hare . the hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change : and alice was a good deal worse off than before , as the march hare had just upset the milk - jug into his plate .",37,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0

"a large rose - tree stood near the entrance of the garden : the roses growing on it were white , but there were three gardeners at it , busily painting them red . alice thought this a very curious thing , and she went nearer to watch them , and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say , ' look out now , five ! do n't go splashing paint over me like that !

"five and seven said nothing , but looked at two . two began in a low voice , ' why the fact is , you see , miss , this here ought to have been a red rose - tree , and we put a white one in by mistake ; and if the queen was to find it out , we should all have our heads cut off , you know . so you see , miss , we 're doing our best , afore she comes , to-- ' at this moment five , who had been anxiously looking across the garden , called out ' the queen ! the queen !

"' and who are these ?

"the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo : she succeeded in getting its body tucked away , comfortably enough , under her arm , with its legs hanging down , but generally , just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out , and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head , it would twist itself round and look up in her face , with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing : and when she had got its head down , and was going to begin again , it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself , and was in the act of crawling away : besides all this , there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to , and , as the doubled - up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground , alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed .",7,"('be', 'être', 'ser')",0
