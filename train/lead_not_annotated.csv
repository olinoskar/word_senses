"d’artagnan wished that answer might be prompt and favorable ; and having again recommended porthos to the care of mousqueton , and paid his bill to the host , he resumed his route with planchet , already relieved of one of his led horses .",42
"the guide unloosed the elephant and led him into a thicket , at the same time asking the travellers not to stir . he held himself ready to bestride the animal at a moment 's notice , should flight become necessary ; but he evidently thought that the procession of the faithful would pass without perceiving them amid the thick foliage , in which they were wholly concealed .",6
"we say the gravel he trod under his feet , for d’artagnan made these reflections while walking solitarily along a pretty little road which led from the camp to the village of angoutin . now , these reflections had led him further than he intended , and the day was beginning to decline when , by the last ray of the setting sun , he thought he saw the barrel of a musket glitter from behind a hedge .",39
"a group of old fakirs were capering and making a wild ado round the statue ; these were striped with ochre , and covered with cuts whence their blood issued drop by drop -- stupid fanatics , who , in the great indian ceremonies , still throw themselves under the wheels of juggernaut . some brahmins , clad in all the sumptuousness of oriental apparel , and leading a woman who faltered at every step , followed . this woman was young , and as fair as a european . her head and neck , shoulders , ears , arms , hands , and toes were loaded down with jewels and gems with bracelets , earrings , and rings ; while a tunic bordered with gold , and covered with a light muslin robe , betrayed the outline of her form .",67

"sir henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast , so that the time was propitious for my excursion . it was a pleasant walk of four miles along the edge of the moor , leading me at last to a small gray hamlet , in which two larger buildings , which proved to be the inn and the house of dr . mortimer , stood high above the rest . the postmaster , who was also the village grocer , had a clear recollection of the telegram .",35
"the guide now led the elephant out of the thicket , and leaped upon his neck . just at the moment that he was about to urge kiouni forward with a peculiar whistle , mr . fogg stopped him , and , turning to sir francis cromarty , said , "" suppose we save this woman . """,3
