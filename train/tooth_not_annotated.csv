"sir henry lay insensible where he had fallen . we tore away his collar , and holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw that there was no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in time . already our friend 's eyelids shivered and he made a feeble effort to move . lestrade thrust his brandy - flask between the baronet 's teeth , and two frightened eyes were looking up at us .",67

"as to the animals in question , they were peccaries belonging to one of the four species which are included in the family , and they were also of the species of tajacu , recognizable by their deep color and the absence of those long teeth with which the mouths of their congeners are armed .",45
"the poor fowl was thin , and covered with one of those thick , bristly skins through which the teeth can not penetrate with all their efforts . the fowl must have been sought for a long time on the perch , to which it had retired to die of old age .",19

"the court of his hotel , situated in the rue du vieux - colombier , resembled a camp from by six o’clock in the morning in summer and eight o’clock in winter . from fifty to sixty musketeers , who appeared to replace one another in order always to present an imposing number , paraded constantly , armed to the teeth and ready for anything .",60
""" here is the lower jaw of a mastodon , "" [ 1 ] i said . "" these are the molar teeth of the deinotherium ; this femur must have belonged to the greatest of those beasts , the megatherium . it certainly is a menagerie , for these remains were not brought here by a deluge . the animals to which they belonged roamed on the shores of this subterranean sea , under the shade of those arborescent trees . here are entire skeletons . and yet i can not understand the appearance of these quadrupeds in a granite cavern .

"there once more , through the panels opening into these caribbean waters ten meters below the surface of the waves , i found so many fascinating exhibits to describe in my daily notes ! among other zoophytes there were portuguese men - of - war known by the name physalia pelagica , like big , oblong bladders with a pearly sheen , spreading their membranes to the wind , letting their blue tentacles drift like silken threads ; to the eye delightful jellyfish , to the touch actual nettles that ooze a corrosive liquid . among the articulates there were annelid worms one and a half meters long , furnished with a pink proboscis , equipped with 1,700 organs of locomotion , snaking through the waters , and as they went , throwing off every gleam in the solar spectrum . from the fish branch there were manta rays , enormous cartilaginous fish ten feet long and weighing 600 pounds , their pectoral fin triangular , their midback slightly arched , their eyes attached to the edges of the face at the front of the head ; they floated like wreckage from a ship , sometimes fastening onto our windows like opaque shutters . there were american triggerfish for which nature has ground only black and white pigments , feather - shaped gobies that were long and plump with yellow fins and jutting jaws , sixteen - decimeter mackerel with short , sharp teeth , covered with small scales , and related to the albacore species . next came swarms of red mullet corseted in gold stripes from head to tail , their shining fins all aquiver , genuine masterpieces of jewelry , formerly sacred to the goddess diana , much in demand by rich romans , and about which the old saying goes : "" he who catches them does n't eat them ! "" finally , adorned with emerald ribbons and dressed in velvet and silk , golden angelfish passed before our eyes like courtiers in the paintings of veronese ; spurred gilthead stole by with their swift thoracic fins ; thread herring fifteen inches long were wrapped in their phosphorescent glimmers ; gray mullet thrashed the sea with their big fleshy tails ; red salmon seemed to mow the waves with their slicing pectorals ; and silver moonfish , worthy of their name , rose on the horizon of the waters like the whitish reflections of many moons .",243
"how many other marvelous new specimens i still could have observed if , little by little , the nautilus had n't settled to the lower strata ! its slanting fins drew it to depths of 2,000 and 3,500 meters . there animal life was represented by nothing more than sea lilies , starfish , delightful crinoids with bell - shaped heads like little chalices on straight stems , top - shell snails , blood - red tooth shells , and fissurella snails , a large species of coastal mollusk .",76
"for two hours a whole aquatic army escorted the nautilus . in the midst of their leaping and cavorting , while they competed with each other in beauty , radiance , and speed , i could distinguish some green wrasse , bewhiskered mullet marked with pairs of black lines , white gobies from the genus eleotris with curved caudal fins and violet spots on the back , wonderful japanese mackerel from the genus scomber with blue bodies and silver heads , glittering azure goldfish whose name by itself gives their full description , several varieties of porgy or gilthead ( some banded gilthead with fins variously blue and yellow , some with horizontal heraldic bars and enhanced by a black strip around their caudal area , some with color zones and elegantly corseted in their six waistbands ) , trumpetfish with flutelike beaks that looked like genuine seafaring woodcocks and were sometimes a meter long , japanese salamanders , serpentine moray eels from the genus echidna that were six feet long with sharp little eyes and a huge mouth bristling with teeth ; etc .",181

"it was a squid of colossal dimensions , fully eight meters long . it was traveling backward with tremendous speed in the same direction as the nautilus . it gazed with enormous , staring eyes that were tinted sea green . its eight arms ( or more accurately , feet ) were rooted in its head , which has earned these animals the name cephalopod ; its arms stretched a distance twice the length of its body and were writhing like the serpentine hair of the furies . you could plainly see its 250 suckers , arranged over the inner sides of its tentacles and shaped like semispheric capsules . sometimes these suckers fastened onto the lounge window by creating vacuums against it . the monster 's mouth -- a beak made of horn and shaped like that of a parrot -- opened and closed vertically . its tongue , also of horn substance and armed with several rows of sharp teeth , would flicker out from between these genuine shears . what a freak of nature ! a bird 's beak on a mollusk ! its body was spindle - shaped and swollen in the middle , a fleshy mass that must have weighed 20,000 to 25,000 kilograms . its unstable color would change with tremendous speed as the animal grew irritated , passing successively from bluish gray to reddish brown .",161

"it would be difficult to describe the disappointment of the party , thus interrupted in their work . they could not now reach the victim ; how , then , could they save her ? sir francis shook his fists , passepartout was beside himself , and the guide gnashed his teeth with rage . the tranquil fogg waited , without betraying any emotion .",51

""" he gazed at me with bleared , drunken eyes for a moment , and then i saw a horror spring up in them , and convulse his whole features , which showed me that he knew me . he staggered back with a livid face , and i saw the perspiration break out upon his brow , while his teeth chattered in his head . at the sight , i leaned my back against the door and laughed loud and long . i had always known that vengeance would be sweet , but i had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me .",60

""" just listen to me , "" i said firmly .

"during that day a fearsome school of sharks provided us with an escort . dreadful animals that teem in these seas and make them extremely dangerous . there were port jackson sharks with a brown back , a whitish belly , and eleven rows of teeth , bigeye sharks with necks marked by a large black spot encircled in white and resembling an eye , and isabella sharks whose rounded snouts were strewn with dark speckles . often these powerful animals rushed at the lounge window with a violence less than comforting . by this point ned land had lost all self - control . he wanted to rise to the surface of the waves and harpoon the monsters , especially certain smooth - hound sharks whose mouths were paved with teeth arranged like a mosaic , and some big five - meter tiger sharks that insisted on personally provoking him . but the nautilus soon picked up speed and easily left astern the fastest of these man - eaters .",131
