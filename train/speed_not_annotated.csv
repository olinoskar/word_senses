"thus reassured , conseil went back to studying the shallows that the nautilus was skimming at moderate speed .",17
"there conseil 's work came to a halt . he did n't have time to finish off the class crustacea through an examination of its stomatopods , amphipods , homopods , isopods , trilobites , branchiopods , ostracods , and entomostraceans . and in order to complete his study of marine articulates , he needed to mention the class cirripedia , which contains water fleas and carp lice , plus the class annelida , which he would have divided without fail into tubifex worms and dorsibranchian worms . but having gone past the shallows of the strait of sicily , the nautilus resumed its usual deep - water speed . from then on , no more mollusks , no more zoophytes , no more articulates . just a few large fish sweeping by like shadows .",108
she obeyed him with what speed she might .,5
"the tide was already strong , for in three days the moon would be full , and it was enough to keep the boat in the center of the current , where it floated swiftly along between the high banks without its being necessary to increase its speed by the aid of the oars .",47
"there my eyes fell on the compass . our heading was still northerly . the log indicated a moderate speed , the pressure gauge a depth of about sixty feet . so circumstances were in favor of the canadian 's plans .",19
"also discredited was the idea of a floating hull or some other enormous wreckage , and again because of this speed of movement .",20
"night fell . a profound silence reigned on board . the compass indicated that the nautilus had n't changed direction . i could hear the beat of its propeller , churning the waves with steady speed . staying on the surface of the water , it rolled gently , sometimes to one side , sometimes to the other .",35
"during the night of december 27 - 28 , the nautilus left the waterways of vanikoro behind with extraordinary speed . its heading was southwesterly , and in three days it had cleared the 750 leagues that separated la pérouse 's islands from the southeastern tip of papua .",19
"there mr . fogg examined a curious vehicle , a kind of frame on two long beams , a little raised in front like the runners of a sledge , and upon which there was room for five or six persons . a high mast was fixed on the frame , held firmly by metallic lashings , to which was attached a large brigantine sail . this mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist a jib - sail . behind , a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle . it was , in short , a sledge rigged like a sloop . during the winter , when the trains are blocked up by the snow , these sledges make extremely rapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another . provided with more sails than a cutter , and with the wind behind them , they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not superior to that of the express trains .",161
"on sped my rainbow , fast as light ; i flew as in a dream ; for glorious rose upon my sight that child of shower and gleam .",1
"public opinion being pronounced , the states of the union were the first in the field . in new york preparations were under way for an expedition designed to chase this narwhale . a high - speed frigate , the abraham lincoln , was fitted out for putting to sea as soon as possible . the naval arsenals were unlocked for commander farragut , who pressed energetically forward with the arming of his frigate .",36
"d’artagnan shook his head , and set off at full speed .",10
"under my eyes i had the excellent charts of the torres strait that had been surveyed and drawn up by the hydrographic engineer vincendon dumoulin and sublieutenant ( now admiral ) coupvent - desbois , who were part of dumont d'urville 's general staff during his final voyage to circumnavigate the globe . these , along with the efforts of captain king , are the best charts for untangling the snarl of this narrow passageway , and i consulted them with scrupulous care . around the nautilus the sea was boiling furiously . a stream of waves , bearing from southeast to northwest at a speed of two and a half miles per hour , broke over heads of coral emerging here and there .",105
"i instantly plunged the end of the fuse into the lantern . it spluttered and flamed , and i ran at the top of my speed to the raft .",25
""" pay him , booby ! "" cried the stranger to his servant , without checking the speed of his horse ; and the man , after throwing two or three silver pieces at the foot of mine host , galloped after his master .",17
"the abraham lincoln had been perfectly chosen and fitted out for its new assignment . it was a high - speed frigate furnished with superheating equipment that allowed the tension of its steam to build to seven atmospheres . under this pressure the abraham lincoln reached an average speed of 18.3 miles per hour , a considerable speed but still not enough to cope with our gigantic cetacean .",20
"the frigate then went along the new jersey coast -- the wonderful right bank of this river , all loaded down with country homes-- and passed by the forts to salutes from their biggest cannons . the abraham lincoln replied by three times lowering and hoisting the american flag , whose thirty - nine stars gleamed from the gaff of the mizzen sail ; then , changing speed to take the buoy - marked channel that curved into the inner bay formed by the spit of sandy hook , it hugged this sand - covered strip of land where thousands of spectators acclaimed us one more time .",67
chapter xlii . headlong speed upward through the horrors of darkness,4
""" no , mr . fix , "" replied the consul . "" she was bespoken yesterday at port said , and the rest of the way is of no account to such a craft . i repeat that the mongolia has been in advance of the time required by the company 's regulations , and gained the prize awarded for excess of speed . """,63
"this was a misfortune . mr . fogg , in order not to deviate from his course , furled his sails and increased the force of the steam ; but the vessel 's speed slackened , owing to the state of the sea , the long waves of which broke against the stern . she pitched violently , and this retarded her progress . the breeze little by little swelled into a tempest , and it was to be feared that the henrietta might not be able to maintain herself upright on the waves .",33
""" another use for electricity : that dial hanging before our eyes indicates how fast the nautilus is going . an electric wire puts it in contact with the patent log ; this needle shows me the actual speed of my submersible . and . . . hold on . . . just now we 're proceeding at the moderate pace of fifteen miles per hour . """,38
""" here , professor aronnax , are the different dimensions of this boat now transporting you . it 's a very long cylinder with conical ends . it noticeably takes the shape of a cigar , a shape already adopted in london for several projects of the same kind . the length of this cylinder from end to end is exactly seventy meters , and its maximum breadth of beam is eight meters . so it is n't quite built on the ten - to - one ratio of your high - speed steamers ; but its lines are sufficiently long , and their tapering gradual enough , so that the displaced water easily slips past and poses no obstacle to the ship 's movements .",92
""" i do not need , pilot , "" said phileas fogg , when they got into the open sea , "" to advise you to use all possible speed . """,29
"a brisk breeze arose about ten o'clock ; but , though it might have been prudent to take in a reef , the pilot , after carefully examining the heavens , let the craft remain rigged as before . the tankadere bore sail admirably , as she drew a great deal of water , and everything was prepared for high speed in case of a gale .",60
"planchet , grimaud , mousqueton , and bazin set off at full speed .",12
"while the boat was advancing with all the speed its four rowers could give it , felton untied the cord and then the handkerchief which bound milady ’s hands together .",8
"ned land was unwilling to leave his provisions behind , and despite the impending danger , he clutched his pig on one side , his kangaroos on the other , and scampered off with respectable speed .",35
"captain nemo decided to make for the ocean floor by submerging on an appropriately gradual diagonal with the help of his side fins , which were set at a 45 degrees angle to the nautilus 's waterline . then the propeller was brought to its maximum speed , and its four blades churned the waves with indescribable violence .",46
"the distance between suez and aden is precisely thirteen hundred and ten miles , and the regulations of the company allow the steamers one hundred and thirty - eight hours in which to traverse it . the mongolia , thanks to the vigorous exertions of the engineer , seemed likely , so rapid was her speed , to reach her destination considerably within that time .",55
"they continued at their best speed for two hours , although the horses were so fatigued that it was to be feared they would soon refuse service .",5
"driven forward by its powerful propeller , the abraham lincoln headed straight for the animal . unconcerned , the latter let us come within half a cable length ; then , not bothering to dive , it got up a little speed , retreated , and was content to keep its distance .",41
"the nautilus passed over these lush , luxuriant depths with tremendous speed . near evening it approached the falkland islands , whose rugged summits i recognized the next day . the sea was of moderate depth . so not without good reason , i assumed that these two islands , plus the many islets surrounding them , used to be part of the magellan coastline . the falkland islands were probably discovered by the famous navigator john davis , who gave them the name davis southern islands . later sir richard hawkins called them the maidenland , after the blessed virgin . subsequently , at the beginning of the 18th century , they were named the malouines by fishermen from saint - malo in brittany , then finally dubbed the falklands by the english , to whom they belong today .",11
but that damned animal also did a speed of 18.5 .,7
"amidst this hush the quartet sped ; he replaced the watch , laid the picture down , rose , and stood on the hearth .",5
they pressed forward with redoubled speed .,5
"for a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started ; but when out of sight he turned his horse to the right , made a circuit , and came back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of the little troop . having recognized the laced hats of his companions and the golden fringe of the cardinal ’s cloak , he waited till the horsemen had turned the angle of the road , and having lost sight of them , he returned at a gallop to the inn , which was opened to him without hesitation .",7
"passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie . up to his arrival at bombay , he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there ; but , now that they were plainly whirling across india at full speed , a sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams . his old vagabond nature returned to him ; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took possession of him . he came to regard his master 's project as intended in good earnest , believed in the reality of the bet , and therefore in the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail within the designated period . already he began to worry about possible delays , and accidents which might happen on the way . he recognised himself as being personally interested in the wager , and trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable folly of the night before . being much less cool - headed than mr . fogg , he was much more restless , counting and recounting the days passed over , uttering maledictions when the train stopped , and accusing it of sluggishness , and mentally blaming mr . fogg for not having bribed the engineer . the worthy fellow was ignorant that , while it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer , it could not be done on the railway .",38
"they made all speed to come up to this gentleman , who appeared to be in great haste .",3
"conseil was in dead earnest , but i did n't subscribe to his views . however , the situation had changed in only a short time and we had n't noticed . now some twenty dugout canoes were surrounding the nautilus . hollowed from tree trunks , these dugouts were long , narrow , and well designed for speed , keeping their balance by means of two bamboo poles that floated on the surface of the water . they were maneuvered by skillful , half - naked paddlers , and i viewed their advance with definite alarm .",58
"by then the nautilus had reduced speed . it moved ahead at a saunter , so to speak . i observed that the red sea 's water was becoming less salty the closer we got to suez .",6
"it was a squid of colossal dimensions , fully eight meters long . it was traveling backward with tremendous speed in the same direction as the nautilus . it gazed with enormous , staring eyes that were tinted sea green . its eight arms ( or more accurately , feet ) were rooted in its head , which has earned these animals the name cephalopod ; its arms stretched a distance twice the length of its body and were writhing like the serpentine hair of the furies . you could plainly see its 250 suckers , arranged over the inner sides of its tentacles and shaped like semispheric capsules . sometimes these suckers fastened onto the lounge window by creating vacuums against it . the monster 's mouth -- a beak made of horn and shaped like that of a parrot -- opened and closed vertically . its tongue , also of horn substance and armed with several rows of sharp teeth , would flicker out from between these genuine shears . what a freak of nature ! a bird 's beak on a mollusk ! its body was spindle - shaped and swollen in the middle , a fleshy mass that must have weighed 20,000 to 25,000 kilograms . its unstable color would change with tremendous speed as the animal grew irritated , passing successively from bluish gray to reddish brown .",217
"phileas fogg got into the train , which started off at full speed .",12
""" vitray , "" said he , "" you will go with all speed to london .",13
"i continued sketching . these monsters kept pace in our waters with such precision , they seemed to be standing still , and i could have traced their outlines in miniature on the window . but we were moving at a moderate speed .",42
"the best course was to wait patiently , and regain the lost time by greater speed when the obstacle was removed . the procession of buffaloes lasted three full hours , and it was night before the track was clear . the last ranks of the herd were now passing over the rails , while the first had already disappeared below the southern horizon .",15
"the young man and young woman perceived they were watched , and redoubled their speed . d’artagnan determined upon his course .",14
"electric wires linked the pilothouse with the engine room , and from this cabin the captain could simultaneously signal heading and speed to his nautilus . he pressed a metal button and at once the propeller slowed down significantly .",21
"d’artagnan was so completely bewildered that without taking any heed of what might become of kitty he ran at full speed across half paris , and did not stop till he came to athos ’s door .",20
"top darted after them as fast as his four legs could carry him , but the emus distanced him with ease , so prodigious was their speed .",26
"along the narrow walls of this passageway , i saw only brilliant streaks , hard lines , fiery furrows , all scrawled by our speeding electric light . with my hand i tried to curb the pounding of my heart .",24
"what a struggle ! ned land quickly grew enthusiastic and even ended up applauding . brandished in its captain 's hands , the nautilus was simply a fearsome harpoon . he hurled it at those fleshy masses and ran them clean through , leaving behind two squirming animal halves . as for those daunting strokes of the tail hitting our sides , the ship never felt them . no more than the collisions it caused . one sperm whale exterminated , it ran at another , tacked on the spot so as not to miss its prey , went ahead or astern , obeyed its rudder , dived when the cetacean sank to deeper strata , rose with it when it returned to the surface , struck it head - on or slantwise , hacked at it or tore it , and from every direction and at any speed , skewered it with its dreadful spur .",148
"i remark upon this to my uncle , who replies doubtfully : "" yes , i am convinced that i am right . "" are we , then , speeding forward to some cataract which will cast us down an abyss ? this method of getting on may please the professor , because it is vertical ; but for my part i prefer the more ordinary modes of horizontal progression .",29
"as for any hope of being rescued by commander farragut , that had to be renounced completely . we were being swept westward , and i estimate that our comparatively moderate speed reached twelve miles per hour . the propeller churned the waves with mathematical regularity , sometimes emerging above the surface and throwing phosphorescent spray to great heights .",31
"near four o'clock in the morning , the submersible picked up speed . we could barely cope with this dizzying rush , and the waves battered us at close range . fortunately ned 's hands came across a big mooring ring fastened to the topside of this sheet - iron back , and we all held on for dear life .",11
"but this mystery would inevitably be cleared up , and soon , because captain nemo gave orders to increase speed ; at once the engine stepped up its drive power , setting the propeller in swifter rotation .",19
""" excellent , "" replied captain bjarne ; "" a sou'-easter . we shall pass down the sound full speed , with all sails set . """,19
""" seven to five ! "" repeated the other , and the two figures flitted away in different directions . their concluding words had evidently been some form of sign and countersign . the instant that their footsteps had died away in the distance , jefferson hope sprang to his feet , and helping his companions through the gap , led the way across the fields at the top of his speed , supporting and half - carrying the girl when her strength appeared to fail her .",71
"this was the opinion of all , and the reporter , going to the telegraphic apparatus which placed the corral in communication with granite house , sent this telegram:--""come with all possible speed . """,32
"indeed , the table had been laid . apparently captain nemo had given this order at the same time he commanded the nautilus to pick up speed .",26
"the mast yet holds firm . the sail stretches tight like a bubble ready to burst . the raft flies at a rate that i can not reckon , but not so fast as the foaming clouds of spray which it dashes from side to side in its headlong speed .",49
"as for the nautilus , it seemed as tranquil and mysterious as ever . it was cruising on the surface of the waves at a moderate speed . nothing seemed to have changed on board .",26
"indeed , despite its efforts , despite the powerful methods it used to split this ice , the nautilus was reduced to immobility . ordinarily , when someone ca n't go any farther , he still has the option of returning in his tracks . but here it was just as impossible to turn back as to go forward , because every passageway had closed behind us , and if our submersible remained even slightly stationary , it would be frozen in without delay . which is exactly what happened near two o'clock in the afternoon , and fresh ice kept forming over the ship 's sides with astonishing speed . i had to admit that captain nemo 's leadership had been most injudicious .",109
"soon after , phileas fogg , sir francis cromarty , and passepartout , installed in a carriage with aouda , who had the best seat , were whirling at full speed towards benares . it was a run of eighty miles , and was accomplished in two hours . during the journey , the young woman fully recovered her senses .",30
"' that was a narrow escape ! ' said alice , a good deal frightened at the sudden change , but very glad to find herself still in existence ; ' and now for the garden ! ' and she ran with all speed back to the little door : but , alas ! the little door was shut again , and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before , ' and things are worse than ever , ' thought the poor child , ' for i never was so small as this before , never ! and i declare it 's too bad , that it is ! '",43
"the nets were hauled on board . they were a breed of trawl resembling those used off the normandy coast , huge pouches held half open by a floating pole and a chain laced through the lower meshes . trailing in this way from these iron glove makers , the resulting receptacles scoured the ocean floor and collected every marine exhibit in their path . that day they gathered up some unusual specimens from these fish - filled waterways : anglerfish whose comical movements qualify them for the epithet "" clowns , "" black commerson anglers equipped with their antennas , undulating triggerfish encircled by little red bands , bloated puffers whose venom is extremely insidious , some olive - hued lampreys , snipefish covered with silver scales , cutlass fish whose electrocuting power equals that of the electric eel and the electric ray , scaly featherbacks with brown crosswise bands , greenish codfish , several varieties of goby , etc . ; finally , some fish of larger proportions : a one - meter jack with a prominent head , several fine bonito from the genus scomber decked out in the colors blue and silver , and three magnificent tuna whose high speeds could n't save them from our trawl .",203
"i estimate that this cast of the net brought in more than 1,000 pounds of fish . it was a fine catch but not surprising . in essence , these nets stayed in our wake for several hours , incarcerating an entire aquatic world in prisons made of thread . so we were never lacking in provisions of the highest quality , which the nautilus 's speed and the allure of its electric light could continually replenish .",66
"the next day , march 19 , at five o'clock in the morning , i was back at my post in the lounge . the electric log indicated that the nautilus had reduced speed . by then it was rising to the surface , but cautiously , while slowly emptying its ballast tanks .",33
""" innocent boy ! "" i exclaimed . "" cod are flat only at the grocery store , where they 're cut open and spread out on display . but in the water they 're like mullet , spindle - shaped and perfectly built for speed . """,45
"it was during the night of december 9 - 10 that the nautilus encountered this army of distinctly nocturnal mollusks . they numbered in the millions . they were migrating from the temperate zones toward zones still warmer , following the itineraries of herring and sardines . we stared at them through our thick glass windows : they swam backward with tremendous speed , moving by means of their locomotive tubes , chasing fish and mollusks , eating the little ones , eaten by the big ones , and tossing in indescribable confusion the ten feet that nature has rooted in their heads like a hairpiece of pneumatic snakes . despite its speed , the nautilus navigated for several hours in the midst of this school of animals , and its nets brought up an incalculable number , among which i recognized all nine species that professor orbigny has classified as native to the pacific ocean .",112
"but as beautiful as it was , i could get only a quick look at this basin whose surface area comprises 2,000,000 square kilometers . even captain nemo 's personal insights were denied me , because that mystifying individual did n't appear one single time during our high - speed crossing . i estimate that the nautilus covered a track of some 600 leagues under the waves of this sea , and this voyage was accomplished in just twenty - four hours times two . departing from the waterways of greece on the morning of february 16 , we cleared the strait of gibraltar by sunrise on the 18th .",49
"among the various fish inhabiting it , some i viewed , others i glimpsed , and the rest i missed completely because of the nautilus 's speed . kindly allow me to sort them out using this whimsical system of classification . it will at least convey the quickness of my observations .",26
"in the midst of the watery mass , brightly lit by our electric beams , there snaked past those one - meter lampreys that are common to nearly every clime . a type of ray from the genus oxyrhynchus , five feet wide , had a white belly with a spotted , ash - gray back and was carried along by the currents like a huge , wide - open shawl . other rays passed by so quickly i could n't tell if they deserved that name "" eagle ray "" coined by the ancient greeks , or those designations of "" rat ray , "" "" bat ray , "" and "" toad ray "" that modern fishermen have inflicted on them . dogfish known as topes , twelve feet long and especially feared by divers , were racing with each other . looking like big bluish shadows , thresher sharks went by , eight feet long and gifted with an extremely acute sense of smell . dorados from the genus sparus , some measuring up to thirteen decimeters , appeared in silver and azure costumes encircled with ribbons , which contrasted with the dark color of their fins ; fish sacred to the goddess venus , their eyes set in brows of gold ; a valuable species that patronizes all waters fresh or salt , equally at home in rivers , lakes , and oceans , living in every clime , tolerating any temperature , their line dating back to prehistoric times on this earth yet preserving all its beauty from those far - off days . magnificent sturgeons , nine to ten meters long and extremely fast , banged their powerful tails against the glass of our panels , showing bluish backs with small brown spots ; they resemble sharks , without equaling their strength , and are encountered in every sea ; in the spring they delight in swimming up the great rivers , fighting the currents of the volga , danube , po , rhine , loire , and oder , while feeding on herring , mackerel , salmon , and codfish ; although they belong to the class of cartilaginous fish , they rate as a delicacy ; they 're eaten fresh , dried , marinated , or salt - preserved , and in olden times they were borne in triumph to the table of the roman epicure lucullus . but whenever the nautilus drew near the surface , those denizens of the mediterranean i could observe most productively belonged to the sixty - third genus of bony fish . these were tuna from the genus scomber , blue - black on top , silver on the belly armor , their dorsal stripes giving off a golden gleam . they are said to follow ships in search of refreshing shade from the hot tropical sun , and they did just that with the nautilus , as they had once done with the vessels of the count de la pérouse . for long hours they competed in speed with our submersible . i could n't stop marveling at these animals so perfectly cut out for racing , their heads small , their bodies sleek , spindle - shaped , and in some cases over three meters long , their pectoral fins gifted with remarkable strength , their caudal fins forked . like certain flocks of birds , whose speed they equal , these tuna swim in triangle formation , which prompted the ancients to say they 'd boned up on geometry and military strategy . and yet they ca n't escape the provençal fishermen , who prize them as highly as did the ancient inhabitants of turkey and italy ; and these valuable animals , as oblivious as if they were deaf and blind , leap right into the marseilles tuna nets and perish by the thousands .",512

"during that day a fearsome school of sharks provided us with an escort . dreadful animals that teem in these seas and make them extremely dangerous . there were port jackson sharks with a brown back , a whitish belly , and eleven rows of teeth , bigeye sharks with necks marked by a large black spot encircled in white and resembling an eye , and isabella sharks whose rounded snouts were strewn with dark speckles . often these powerful animals rushed at the lounge window with a violence less than comforting . by this point ned land had lost all self - control . he wanted to rise to the surface of the waves and harpoon the monsters , especially certain smooth - hound sharks whose mouths were paved with teeth arranged like a mosaic , and some big five - meter tiger sharks that insisted on personally provoking him . but the nautilus soon picked up speed and easily left astern the fastest of these man - eaters .",158
