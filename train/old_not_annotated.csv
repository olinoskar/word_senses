"in every big city the monster was the latest rage ; they sang about it in the coffee houses , they ridiculed it in the newspapers , they dramatized it in the theaters . the tabloids found it a fine opportunity for hatching all sorts of hoaxes . in those newspapers short of copy , you saw the reappearance of every gigantic imaginary creature , from "" moby dick , "" that dreadful white whale from the high arctic regions , to the stupendous kraken whose tentacles could entwine a 500-ton craft and drag it into the ocean depths . they even reprinted reports from ancient times : the views of aristotle and pliny accepting the existence of such monsters , then the norwegian stories of bishop pontoppidan , the narratives of paul egede , and finally the reports of captain harrington-- whose good faith is above suspicion -- in which he claims he saw , while aboard the castilian in 1857 , one of those enormous serpents that , until then , had frequented only the seas of france 's old extremist newspaper , the constitutionalist .",181

"so that was the story of dorian gray 's parentage . crudely as it had been told to him , it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of a strange , almost modern romance . a beautiful woman risking everything for a mad passion . a few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a hideous , treacherous crime . months of voiceless agony , and then a child born in pain . the mother snatched away by death , the boy left to solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man .",91
"he was a marvellous type , too , this lad , whom by so curious a chance he had met in basil 's studio , or could be fashioned into a marvellous type , at any rate . grace was his , and the white purity of boyhood , and beauty such as old greek marbles kept for us . there was nothing that one could not do with him . he could be made a titan or a toy . what a pity it was that such beauty was destined to fade ! . . .",53

"but , if he thought of these possibilities , he did not betray the fact by any outward sign . always the same impassible member of the reform club , whom no incident could surprise , as unvarying as the ship 's chronometers , and seldom having the curiosity even to go upon the deck , he passed through the memorable scenes of the red sea with cold indifference ; did not care to recognise the historic towns and villages which , along its borders , raised their picturesque outlines against the sky ; and betrayed no fear of the dangers of the arabic gulf , which the old historians always spoke of with horror , and upon which the ancient navigators never ventured without propitiating the gods by ample sacrifices . how did this eccentric personage pass his time on the mongolia ? he made his four hearty meals every day , regardless of the most persistent rolling and pitching on the part of the steamer ; and he played whist indefatigably , for he had found partners as enthusiastic in the game as himself .",108
"he was , we repeat , handsome , young , and bold ; he spoke of love like a man who did love and was anxious to be loved in return . there was certainly enough in all this to turn a head only twenty - three years old , and mme . bonacieux had just attained that happy period of life .",48
"to be sure it is pleasant at any time ; for thornfield is a fine old hall , rather neglected of late years perhaps , but still it is a respectable place ; yet you know in winter - time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters .",15
"the aspect of the country , as well as the manners and distinctions of race , is daily changing . formerly one was obliged to travel in india by the old cumbrous methods of going on foot or on horseback , in palanquins or unwieldy coaches ; now fast steamboats ply on the indus and the ganges , and a great railway , with branch lines joining the main line at many points on its route , traverses the peninsula from bombay to calcutta in three days .",30
"and now i can recall the picture of the grey old house of god rising calm before me , of a rook wheeling round the steeple , of a ruddy morning sky beyond .",10
"my conjecture had been correct : the strangers had slipped in before us , and they now stood by the vault of the rochesters , their backs towards us , viewing through the rails the old time - stained marble tomb , where a kneeling angel guarded the remains of damer de rochester , slain at marston moor in the time of the civil wars , and of elizabeth , his wife .",35
"of course i did not -- i had never heard of him before ; but the old lady seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact , with which everybody must be acquainted by instinct .",16

"passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie . up to his arrival at bombay , he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there ; but , now that they were plainly whirling across india at full speed , a sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams . his old vagabond nature returned to him ; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took possession of him . he came to regard his master 's project as intended in good earnest , believed in the reality of the bet , and therefore in the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail within the designated period . already he began to worry about possible delays , and accidents which might happen on the way . he recognised himself as being personally interested in the wager , and trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable folly of the night before . being much less cool - headed than mr . fogg , he was much more restless , counting and recounting the days passed over , uttering maledictions when the train stopped , and accusing it of sluggishness , and mentally blaming mr . fogg for not having bribed the engineer . the worthy fellow was ignorant that , while it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer , it could not be done on the railway .",53

"through the gateway we passed into the avenue , where the wheels were again hushed amid the leaves , and the old trees shot their branches in a sombre tunnel over our heads . baskerville shuddered as he looked up the long , dark drive to where the house glimmered like a ghost at the farther end .",21

"a square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall , approached by a double stair . from this central point two long corridors extended the whole length of the building , from which all the bedrooms opened . my own was in the same wing as baskerville 's and almost next door to it . these rooms appeared to be much more modern than the central part of the house , and the bright paper and numerous candles did something to remove the sombre impression which our arrival had left upon my mind .",10

"and yet it was not quite the last . i found myself weary and yet wakeful , tossing restlessly from side to side , seeking for the sleep which would not come . far away a chiming clock struck out the quarters of the hours , but otherwise a deathly silence lay upon the old house . and then suddenly , in the very dead of the night , there came a sound to my ears , clear , resonant , and unmistakable . it was the sob of a woman , the muffled , strangling gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow . i sat up in bed and listened intently . the noise could not have been far away and was certainly in the house . for half an hour i waited with every nerve on the alert , but there came no other sound save the chiming clock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall .",54

"however , during the day of march 16 , these tracts of ice completely barred our path . it was n't the ice bank as yet , just huge ice fields cemented together by the cold . this obstacle could n't stop captain nemo , and he launched his ship against the ice fields with hideous violence . the nautilus went into these brittle masses like a wedge , splitting them with dreadful cracklings . it was an old - fashioned battering ram propelled with infinite power . hurled aloft , ice rubble fell back around us like hail . through brute force alone , the submersible carved out a channel for itself . carried away by its momentum , the ship sometimes mounted on top of these tracts of ice and crushed them with its weight , or at other times , when cooped up beneath the ice fields , it split them with simple pitching movements , creating wide punctures .",78

"the old man read so much truth and so much grief in the face of the young man that he made him a sign to listen , and repeated in a low voice : "" it was scarcely nine o’clock when i heard a noise in the street , and was wondering what it could be , when on coming to my door , i found that somebody was endeavoring to open it .",1
"immediately , he who had spoken to me approached the door of the pavilion , opened it with a key he had in his hand , closed the door and disappeared , while at the same time the other two men ascended the ladder . the little old man remained at the coach door ; the coachman took care of his horses , the lackey held the saddlehorses .",47

"the ordinary sitting - room and bedrooms i left much as they were : for i knew diana and mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables , and chairs , and beds , than from the spectacle of the smartest innovations . still some novelty was necessary , to give to their return the piquancy with which i wished it to be invested .",28

"he then conducted cacambo to the old man ; candide acted now only a second character , and attended his valet .",6

"candide had a curiosity to see some of their priests , and desired cacambo to ask the old man where they were . at which he smiling said , "" my friends , we are all of us priests ; the king and all the heads of families sing solemn hymns of thanksgiving every morning , accompanied by five or six thousand musicians .

"the shellfish meleagrina , that womb for pearls whose valves are nearly equal in size , has the shape of a round shell with thick walls and a very rough exterior . some of these shells were furrowed with flaky , greenish bands that radiated down from the top . these were the young oysters . the others had rugged black surfaces , measured up to fifteen centimeters in width , and were ten or more years old .",77

"henry iv , when besieging paris , had loaves and provisions thrown over the walls . the cardinal had little notes thrown over in which he represented to the rochellais how unjust , selfish , and barbarous was the conduct of their leaders . these leaders had corn in abundance , and would not let them partake of it ; they adopted as a maxim -- for they , too , had maxims -- that it was of very little consequence that women , children , and old men should die , so long as the men who were to defend the walls remained strong and healthy .",87
"the notes reminded the men that the children , women , and old men whom they allowed to die were their sons , their wives , and their fathers , and that it would be more just for everyone to be reduced to the common misery , in order that equal conditions should give birth to unanimous resolutions .",12
