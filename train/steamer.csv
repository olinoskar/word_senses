"the weather was bad during the latter days of the voyage . the wind , obstinately remaining in the north - west , blew a gale , and retarded the steamer . the rangoon rolled heavily and the passengers became impatient of the long , monstrous waves which the wind raised before their path .",30,"('steamer', 'paquebot', 'vapor')",0
"the pilot went on board at six , and took his place on the bridge , to guide the rangoon through the channels to the port of hong kong . passepartout longed to ask him if the steamer had left for yokohama ; but he dared not , for he wished to preserve the spark of hope , which still remained till the last moment . he had confided his anxiety to fix who -- the sly rascal!--tried to console him by saying that mr . fogg would be in time if he took the next boat ; but this only put passepartout in a passion .",37,"('steamer', 'paquebot', 'vapor')",0

"in essence , on july 20 , 1866 , the steamer governor higginson , from the calcutta & burnach steam navigation co. , encountered this moving mass five miles off the eastern shores of australia . captain baker at first thought he was in the presence of an unknown reef ; he was even about to fix its exact position when two waterspouts shot out of this inexplicable object and sprang hissing into the air some 150 feet . so , unless this reef was subject to the intermittent eruptions of a geyser , the governor higginson had fair and honest dealings with some aquatic mammal , until then unknown , that could spurt from its blowholes waterspouts mixed with air and steam .",10,"('steamer', 'steamer', 'vapor')",1
"the pilot probably does not know to this day why his responses won him this enthusiastic greeting . he remounted the bridge , and guided the steamer through the flotilla of junks , tankas , and fishing boats which crowd the harbour of hong kong .",26,"('steamer', 'paquebot', 'vapor')",0
"chance had strangely favoured phileas fogg , for had not the carnatic been forced to lie over for repairing her boilers , she would have left on the 6th of november , and the passengers for japan would have been obliged to await for a week the sailing of the next steamer . mr . fogg was , it is true , twenty - four hours behind his time ; but this could not seriously imperil the remainder of his tour .",51,"('steamer', 'paquebot', 'vapor')",0

"the steamer lay puffing alongside the quay , on the point of starting . passepartout had but few steps to go ; and , rushing upon the plank , he crossed it , and fell unconscious on the deck , just as the carnatic was moving off . several sailors , who were evidently accustomed to this sort of scene , carried the poor frenchman down into the second cabin , and passepartout did not wake until they were one hundred and fifty miles away from china . thus he found himself the next morning on the deck of the carnatic , and eagerly inhaling the exhilarating sea - breeze . the pure air sobered him . he began to collect his sense , which he found a difficult task ; but at last he recalled the events of the evening before , fix 's revelation , and the opium - house .",1,"('steamer', 'paquebot', 'vapor')",0

"the trip was being accomplished most successfully , and passepartout was enchanted with the congenial companion which chance had secured him in the person of the delightful fix . on sunday , october 20th , towards noon , they came in sight of the indian coast : two hours later the pilot came on board . a range of hills lay against the sky in the horizon , and soon the rows of palms which adorn bombay came distinctly into view . the steamer entered the road formed by the islands in the bay , and at half - past four she hauled up at the quays of bombay .",83,"('steamer', 'paquebot', 'vapor')",0

"what happened when the pilot - boat came in sight of shanghai will be easily guessed . the signals made by the tankadere had been seen by the captain of the yokohama steamer , who , espying the flag at half - mast , had directed his course towards the little craft . phileas fogg , after paying the stipulated price of his passage to john busby , and rewarding that worthy with the additional sum of five hundred and fifty pounds , ascended the steamer with aouda and fix ; and they started at once for nagasaki and yokohama .",85,"('steamer', 'steamer', 'vapor')",1
"for some days the nautilus kept veering away from the american coast . it obviously did n't want to frequent the waves of the gulf of mexico or the caribbean sea . yet there was no shortage of water under its keel , since the average depth of these seas is 1,800 meters ; but these waterways , strewn with islands and plowed by steamers , probably did n't agree with captain nemo .",64,"('steamer', 'steamer', 'vaporar')",3
"the steamer which was about to depart from yokohama to san francisco belonged to the pacific mail steamship company , and was named the general grant . she was a large paddle - wheel steamer of two thousand five hundred tons ; well equipped and very fast . the massive walking - beam rose and fell above the deck ; at one end a piston - rod worked up and down ; and at the other was a connecting - rod which , in changing the rectilinear motion to a circular one , was directly connected with the shaft of the paddles . the general grant was rigged with three masts , giving a large capacity for sails , and thus materially aiding the steam power . by making twelve miles an hour , she would cross the ocean in twenty - one days . phileas fogg was therefore justified in hoping that he would reach san francisco by the 2nd of december , new york by the 11th , and london on the 20th -- thus gaining several hours on the fatal date of the 21st of december .",1,"('steamer', 'paquebot', 'vapor')",0

"it was seven in the morning when mr . fogg , aouda , and passepartout set foot upon the american continent , if this name can be given to the floating quay upon which they disembarked . these quays , rising and falling with the tide , thus facilitate the loading and unloading of vessels . alongside them were clippers of all sizes , steamers of all nationalities , and the steamboats , with several decks rising one above the other , which ply on the sacramento and its tributaries . there were also heaped up the products of a commerce which extends to mexico , chili , peru , brazil , europe , asia , and all the pacific islands .",64,"('steamer', 'steamer', 'vaporar')",3
"at six o'clock , sometimes afloat and sometimes submerged , the nautilus passed well out from el tur , which sat at the far end of a bay whose waters seemed to be dyed red , as captain nemo had already mentioned . then night fell in the midst of a heavy silence occasionally broken by the calls of pelicans and nocturnal birds , by the sound of surf chafing against rocks , or by the distant moan of a steamer churning the waves of the gulf with noisy blades .",80,"('steamer', 'steamer', 'vapor')",1
