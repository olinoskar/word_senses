"so , then , the dream in which i had had a vision of the prehistoric world , of the tertiary and post - tertiary periods , was now realised . and there we were alone , in the bowels of the earth , at the mercy of its wild inhabitants !",46,"('mercy', 'merci', 'merced')",1
"thus it happened that the wild animals , jaguars , wild boars , capybaras , koalas , and game of every kind , mad with terror , had fled to the banks of the mercy and to the tadorn marsh , beyond the road to port balloon .",34,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"they had abandoned granite house , and would not even take shelter at the chimneys , but encamped under a tent , near the mouth of the mercy .",27,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0

"it might be , indeed , that their only intention was to obtain fresh water from the mercy , and it was not impossible that the bridge , thrown across a mile and a half from the mouth , and the manufactory at the chimneys might escape their notice .",17,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"to return to the chimneys , it was enough to cross the plateau obliquely for the space of a mile , and then to descend to the elbow formed by the first detour of the mercy .",35,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"the most important and most urgent was the establishment of a bridge over the mercy , so as to form a communication with the southern part of the island and granite house ; then the making of an enclosure for the musmons or other woolly animals which they wished to capture .",14,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"it was ten o'clock in the morning when the canoe reached a second angle of the mercy , nearly five miles from its mouth .",16,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"the settlers were now only four , and , as it seemed , at the mercy of the convicts .",15,"('mercy', 'merci', 'merced')",1
"the little band retraced their steps , therefore , and by the left bank of the mercy , cyrus harding and his companions arrived at the chimneys .",16,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"in no place , either in the depths of the forests or under the trees on the banks of the mercy , was the presence of man revealed .",20,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0

"but nothing could be easier than to dig a broad deep ditch , which could be filled from the lake , and the overflow of which would throw itself by a rapid fall into the bed of the mercy .",38,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"about five o'clock in the evening cyrus harding and his companions retraced their steps to their dwelling by traversing tadorn 's fens , and crossed the mercy on the ice - bridge .",26,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"they thus visited all the left bank of the mercy , along which ran the road from the corral to the mouth of falls river .",9,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"the end of the bridge which rested on the right bank of the mercy was to be firm , but the other end on the left bank was to be movable , so that it might be raised by means of a counterpoise , as some canal bridges are managed .",13,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"this was certainly a considerable work , and though it was skillfully conducted , it took some time , for the mercy at this place was eighty feet wide .",21,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
the construction of the mercy bridge lasted three weeks of regular hard work .,4,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"they were visited every day , and at three different times , during the first days , specimens of those antarctic foxes which they had already seen on the right bank of the mercy were found in them .",33,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"on the 21st of november , cyrus harding began to plan the canal which was to close the plateau on the west , from the south angle of lake grant to the angle of the mercy .",35,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"pencroft and neb , during this time , had gone to fetch the boat , moored a few hundred feet higher up , on the bank of the mercy , and by the time they returned , ayrton was ready to start .",28,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
""" is she not safe at the mouth of the mercy ? "" asked cyrus harding .",10,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"they therefore followed the bank of the mercy , traversed prospect heights , and after a walk of five miles or more they reached a glade , situated two hundred feet from lake grant .",7,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"towards four o'clock , the navigation of the mercy became exceedingly difficult , for its course was obstructed by aquatic plants and rocks .",8,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"beyond that , the mercy was lost in the bushwood , where it was fed from some hidden source .",4,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"in the meantime harness of vegetable fiber had been manufactured , and some days after the capture of the onagers , not only the cart was ready , but a straight road , or rather a cutting , had been made through the forests of the far west , from the angle of the mercy to port balloon .",54,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"at eight o'clock that evening the cart , after passing over the mercy bridge , descended the left bank of the river , and stopped on the beach .",12,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"the chief thing was to hinder these plunderers from reaching the plateau , for the garden and the poultry - yard would then have been at their mercy , and immense , perhaps irreparable mischief , would inevitably be the result , especially with regard to the corn - field .",27,"('mercy', 'merci', 'merced')",1
"but as the invasion of the plateau could only be made by the left bank of the mercy , it was sufficient to oppose the colpeos on the narrow bank between the river and the cliff of granite .",17,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"as to the mercy , it was more directly fed from ample springs concealed under the cover of jacamar wood , and it was by springs of this nature , spreading in a thousand streamlets , that the soil of the serpentine peninsula was watered .",3,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"the waters of the mercy flowed under a roof of ice , which , at each rising and ebbing of the tide , broke up with loud crashes .",4,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"however , cyrus harding did not remember having seen , at the time of his excursion to the crater , any other watercourses but the red creek and the mercy .",29,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
the road was as deserted as all that part of the jacamar wood which lay between the mercy and the lake .,17,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"besides that , the fishing , either in the lake or the mercy , was very profitable , for pencroft had made some lines , armed with iron hooks , with which they frequently caught fine trout , and a species of fish whose silvery sides were speckled with yellow , and which were also extremely savory .",12,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"shoals of salmon entered the mercy , and ascended the country for several miles .",5,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"the latter was then led towards the mouth of the mercy , and all climbing the left bank of the river , reached prospect heights .",10,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"a river there was called the mercy , a mountain took the name of mount franklin , a small lake was named lake grant , and the forests became the forests of the far west .",6,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"the best would evidently have been the shore exposed directly to the south ; but the mercy would have to be crossed , and that was a difficulty .",16,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"neb accompanied them to the turn of the mercy , and after they had crossed , he raised the bridge .",8,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"the settlers , therefore , went to the plateau , ascending the left bank of the mercy , and placed themselves on the edge which looked northwest and southeast , that is , above the curiously - shaped rocks which bordered the river .",16,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"but the buildings , the plantations , all their arrangements at the mercy of the pirates !",12,"('mercy', 'merci', 'merced')",1
"i therefore propose that we divide into three parties . the first of which shall be posted at the chimneys , the second at the mouth of the mercy .",28,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"the ice melted , the snow disappeared ; the shore , the plateau , the banks of the mercy , the forest , again became practicable .",18,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"harding and neb proceeded towards the mercy , and ascended its left bank without meeting with any trace of the convicts ; nor on the other side of the river , in the depths of the wood , could they perceive any suspicious indications .",6,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"besides , it might be supposed that in all probability either the convicts knew of the return of the settlers to granite house , by having seen them pass on the road from the corral , or , after the devastation of the plateau , they had penetrated into jacamar wood , following the course of the mercy , and were thus ignorant of their return .",57,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"in consequence and in view of these future establishments , it became of much importance that they should penetrate into all the yet unknown parts of lincoln island , that is to say , through that thick forest which extended on the right bank of the mercy , from its mouth to the extremity of the serpentine peninsula , as well as on the whole of its western side .",46,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0

"the stranger placed the point of his sword at his throat ; and monsieur porthos , finding himself at the mercy of his adversary , acknowledged himself conquered .",20,"('mercy', 'merci', 'merced')",1
"and as if these few words had been difficult to say , he retreated to the beach , where he walked up and down between the cascade and the mouth of the mercy , in a state of extreme agitation .",32,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"at the same instant aramis placed his sword point on the breast of his fallen enemy , and forced him to ask for mercy .",23,"('mercy', 'merci', 'merced')",1
"it could now be seen that one of the convicts held a lead - line in his hand , and that he wished to fathom the depth of the channel hollowed out by the current of the mercy .",37,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"in fact , when the boat was abandoned at the sources of the mercy , it had been agreed that after having surveyed the west coast , they should go back to it , and return to granite house by the mercy .",13,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"they advanced to within five cables - lengths of that part of the shore terminated by flotsam point , and after having rounded it in a semicircular line , still protected by the brig 's guns , they proceeded towards the mouth of the mercy .",44,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"twenty minutes after the first shots were fired , the boat was less than two cables - lengths off the mercy .",20,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
""" the boat has remained by itself for one day at the sources of the mercy , "" replied gideon spilett ; "" it may just as well stay there two days !",15,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0

"a second boat was also lowered , in which eight men took their places , and while the first pulled straight for the islet , to dislodge the colonists from thence the second maneuvered so as to force the entrance of the mercy .",42,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
the distance from mandible cape to the mouth of the mercy was not more than eight miles .,10,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"about four o'clock , pencroft leaving the point of the islet on his left , entered the channel which separated it from the coast , and at five o'clock the anchor of the "" bonadventure "" was buried in the sand at the mouth of the mercy .",46,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
""" yes , a real boat , "" replied the sailor ; "" but we do not want one for a sea voyage , and in five days at the most , i will undertake to construct a canoe fit to navigate the mercy . """,43,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0

"cyrus harding could have utilized the second fall which flowed into the mercy to establish his motive power , the first being already occupied with moving the felting mill , but , after some consultation , it was decided that a simple windmill should be built on prospect heights .",12,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"he did not mean to build a boat with boards and planking , but simply a flat - bottomed canoe , which would be well suited for navigating the mercy -- above all , for approaching its source , where the water would naturally be shallow .",29,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"they ascertained , however , that eatable shellfish abounded there , but these could not be of any great advantage to them until some easy means of communication had been established between the two banks of the mercy , and until the means of transport had been perfected .",37,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"being armed with muskets alone , they could do no harm to the settlers , in ambush at the chimneys and the mouth of the mercy ; but , not knowing the latter to be supplied with long - range rifles , they on their side did not believe themselves to be exposed .",25,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"from the two posts of the mercy and the chimneys they watched her without giving a sign of life , but not without some emotion .",6,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"as yet , they only hunted in jacamar wood , on the left of the river , because , for want of a bridge or boat , the mercy had not yet been crossed .",28,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"the day on which the hunters spoke thus , they were in a part of the forest near the mercy , remarkable for its beautiful trees .",19,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
"but they had in no way surveyed the woods which covered the serpentine peninsula , all to the right of the mercy , the left bank of falls river , and the wilderness of spurs and valleys which supported three quarters of the base of mount franklin , to the east , the north , and the west , and where doubtless many secret retreats existed .",21,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0

"soon the "" speedy "" reached the point of the islet ; she rounded it with ease ; the mainsail was braced up , and the brig hugging the wind , stood across the mouth of the mercy .",37,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0

"the access to these hunting - grounds was easy ; besides , whether they reached them by the road to port balloon , after having passed the mercy bridge , or by turning the rocks from flotsam point , the hunters were never distant from granite house more than two or three miles .",27,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0

"the chevalier de rochefort cast a glance backward , and saw that porthos and aramis had placed themselves between him and the gate ; he understood that he was completely at the mercy of these four men .",32,"('mercy', 'merci', 'merced')",1
"they had to profit by the low tide to cross the channel , and it was agreed that they would construct , for this purpose , as well as they could , a boat which would render communication so much easier , and would also permit them to ascend the mercy , at the time of their grand exploration of the southwest of the island , which was put off till the first fine days .",50,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0

"the weather was magnificent , the sea as calm as if its waters were contained within the narrow limits of a lake . thus the boat could proceed with as much security as if it was ascending the tranquil current of the mercy .",42,"('mercy', 'mercy', 'merced')",0
