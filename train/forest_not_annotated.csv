chapter xxxix . forest scenery illuminated by electricity,3
as they advanced the forest element diminished .,4
"after walking a mile we reached the outskirts of a vast forest , but not one of those forests of fungi which bordered port gräuben .",11

"we had long lost sight of the sea shore behind the hills of bones . the rash professor , careless of losing his way , hurried me forward . we advanced in silence , bathed in luminous electric fluid . by some phenomenon which i am unable to explain , it lighted up all sides of every object equally . such was its diffusiveness , there being no central point from which the light emanated , that shadows no longer existed . you might have thought yourself under the rays of a vertical sun in a tropical region at noonday and the height of summer . no vapour was visible . the rocks , the distant mountains , a few isolated clumps of forest trees in the distance , presented a weird and wonderful aspect under these totally new conditions of a universal diffusion of light . we were like hoffmann 's shadowless man .",123
"that forest - dell , where lowood lay , was the cradle of fog and fog - bred pestilence ; which , quickening with the quickening spring , crept into the orphan asylum , breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and dormitory , and , ere may arrived , transformed the seminary into an hospital .",1
"in no place , either in the depths of the forests or under the trees on the banks of the mercy , was the presence of man revealed .",10
""" yes , professor , the sea supplies all my needs . sometimes i cast my nets in our wake , and i pull them up ready to burst . sometimes i go hunting right in the midst of this element that has long seemed so far out of man 's reach , and i corner the game that dwells in my underwater forests . like the flocks of old proteus , king neptune 's shepherd , my herds graze without fear on the ocean 's immense prairies . there i own vast properties that i harvest myself , and which are forever sown by the hand of the creator of all things . """,63
""" sir , i understand perfectly how your nets can furnish excellent fish for your table ; i understand less how you can chase aquatic game in your underwater forests ; but how a piece of red meat , no matter how small , can figure in your menu , that i do n't understand at all . """,29
"it was for other traces than those of animals that he searched the thickets of the vast forest , but nothing suspicious ever appeared .",17
"the settlers now began to talk of fetching the balloon - case , which they were anxious to place in perfect security ; but to bring it , it would be necessary to take a cart to port balloon , and consequently , necessary to beat a road through the dense forests of the far west .",51
"in the meantime harness of vegetable fiber had been manufactured , and some days after the capture of the onagers , not only the cart was ready , but a straight road , or rather a cutting , had been made through the forests of the far west , from the angle of the mercy to port balloon .",43
"the time was , therefore , very favorable for the projected expedition , which , if it did not accomplish its principal object , would at any rate be fruitful in discoveries , especially of natural productions , since harding proposed to explore those dense forests of the far west , which stretched to the extremity of the serpentine peninsula .",45
"conseil kept ned under observation . the harpooner walked in the lead , and during his stroll through this forest , he gathered with sure hands some excellent fruit that should have completed his provisions .",19
they advanced more rapidly and easily along the bank of the river than in the forest .,15
"from time to time they came upon the traces of animals of a large size who had come to quench their thirst at the stream , but none were actually seen , and it was evidently not in this part of the forest that the peccary had received the bullet which had cost pencroft a grinder .",42
"so we returned through the forest , and we completed our harvest by making a clean sweep of some palm cabbages that had to be picked from the crowns of their trees , some small beans that i recognized as the "" abrou "" of the malaysians , and some high - quality yams .",5
"the bank was raised a little above the level of the sea , and on this luxuriant soil , supported by a granite base , the fine forest trees seemed to be as firmly planted as in the interior of the island .",27
"but at that moment my attention was drawn to an unexpected sight . at a distance of five hundred paces , at the turn of a high promontory , appeared a high , tufted , dense forest . it was composed of trees of moderate height , formed like umbrellas , with exact geometrical outlines . the currents of wind seemed to have had no effect upon their shape , and in the midst of the windy blasts they stood unmoved and firm , just like a clump of petrified cedars .",36
""" then let 's keep hunting , "" conseil replied , "" but while heading back to the sea . we 've arrived at the foothills of these mountains , and i think we 'll do better if we return to the forest regions . """,42
"it was good advice and we took it . after an hour 's walk we reached a genuine sago palm forest . a few harmless snakes fled underfoot . birds of paradise stole off at our approach , and i was in real despair of catching one when conseil , walking in the lead , stooped suddenly , gave a triumphant shout , and came back to me , carrying a magnificent bird of paradise .",20
""" that may be , "" i replied ; "" but if there have been creatures now extinct in these underground regions , why may not some of those monsters be now roaming through these gloomy forests , or hidden behind the steep crags ? """,36
a few very timid animals were seen under the forest - trees .,9
"the colonists had paid visits also to the oyster bed , the warren , the coal and iron mines , and to the till then unexplored districts of the far west forest , which abounded in game .",31
"how different it was with material things ! where had they passed to ? where was the great crocus - coloured robe , on which the gods fought against the giants , that had been worked by brown girls for the pleasure of athena ? where the huge velarium that nero had stretched across the colosseum at rome , that titan sail of purple on which was represented the starry sky , and apollo driving a chariot drawn by white , gilt - reined steeds ? he longed to see the curious table - napkins wrought for the priest of the sun , on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast ; the mortuary cloth of king chilperic , with its three hundred golden bees ; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the bishop of pontus and were figured with "" lions , panthers , bears , dogs , forests , rocks , hunters -- all , in fact , that a painter can copy from nature "" ; and the coat that charles of orleans once wore , on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning "" madame , je suis tout joyeux , "" the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread , and each note , of square shape in those days , formed with four pearls .",159
"if any mysterious being resided on it , it could only be under cover of the impenetrable forest of the serpentine peninsula , to which the colonists had not yet directed their investigations .",17
"certainly , the former savage of tabor island could not be perplexed how to live in the forest , abounding in game , but was it not to be feared that he had resumed his habits , and that this freedom would revive in him his wild instincts ?",17
neither in the forests of the far west was anything to be seen .,3
"captain nemo invites professor aronnax on a hunting trip that will take place tomorrow morning in his crespo island forests . he hopes nothing will prevent the professor from attending , and he looks forward with pleasure to the professor 's companions joining him .",19
""" underwater forests ! "" i exclaimed .",2
""" professor aronnax , "" the captain told me , "" i beg you to share my breakfast without formality . we can chat while we eat . because , although i promised you a stroll in my forests , i made no pledge to arrange for your encountering a restaurant there . accordingly , eat your breakfast like a man who 'll probably eat dinner only when it 's extremely late . """,38
""" professor , when i proposed that you go hunting in my crespo forests , you thought i was contradicting myself . when i informed you that it was an issue of underwater forests , you thought i 'd gone insane . professor , you must never make snap judgments about your fellow man . """,33
""" but my gallant ned , "" i told him , "" the forests of crespo island are simply underwater forests ! """,20
"the elephant , thanks to the skilful guidance of the parsee , was advancing rapidly through the still darksome forest , and , an hour after leaving the pagoda , had crossed a vast plain . they made a halt at seven o'clock , the young woman being still in a state of complete prostration . the guide made her drink a little brandy and water , but the drowsiness which stupefied her could not yet be shaken off .",19
an underwater forest,2
"we had finally arrived on the outskirts of this forest , surely one of the finest in captain nemo 's immense domains . he regarded it as his own and had laid the same claim to it that , in the first days of the world , the first men had to their forests on land . besides , who else could dispute his ownership of this underwater property ? what other , bolder pioneer would come , ax in hand , to clear away its dark underbrush ?",53
"a gentle slope gravitated to an uneven bottom whose depth was about fifteen fathoms . this bottom was completely different from the one i had visited during my first excursion under the waters of the pacific ocean . here i saw no fine - grained sand , no underwater prairies , not one open - sea forest . i immediately recognized the wondrous region in which captain nemo did the honors that day . it was the coral realm .",56
it was as still as a church on a week - day : the pattering rain on the forest leaves was the only sound audible in its vicinage .,18
"behind in the west , but at a distance of four miles , rose the first trees of the forests of the far west .",19
