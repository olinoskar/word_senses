"aramis reflected for a minute , and then said , coloring , "" will it be really rendering you a service , d’artagnan ? """,17
"if it was he , he possesses a power which renders him master of the elements . """,10
"porthos , as we have seen , had a character exactly opposite to that of athos . he not only talked much , but he talked loudly , little caring , we must render him that justice , whether anybody listened to him or not . he talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing himself talk . he spoke upon all subjects except the sciences , alleging in this respect the inveterate hatred he had borne to scholars from his childhood .",33
"he had not so noble an air as athos , and the commencement of their intimacy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman , whom he endeavored to eclipse by his splendid dress .",17
"at the denunciating sound , the monks would be rendered aware that temptation was besieging a brother , and all the community would go to prayers .",9
"the bridge would render easy the transport of the balloon case , which would furnish them with linen , and the inhabitants of the enclosure would yield wool which would supply them with winter clothes .",3

"herbert , a gallant boy , already remarkably well informed in the natural sciences , would render greater service to the common cause .",16
"he was unaware that the frenchman and his two companions had been miraculously cast on shore , that the fishermen of the lofoten islands had rendered them assistance , and that the professor , on his return to france , had published that work in which seven months of the strange and eventful navigation of the "" nautilus "" were narrated and exposed to the curiosity of the public .",25

"substances necessary for the photographic reproduction , collodion for preparing the glass plate , nitrate of silver to render it sensitive , hyposulfate of soda to fix the prints obtained , chloride of ammonium in which to soak the paper destined to give the positive proof , acetate of soda and chloride of gold in which to immerse the paper , nothing was wanting .",18
the despair of athos had given place to a concentrated grief which only rendered more lucid the brilliant mental faculties of that extraordinary man .,13
"it was necessary to bring the case to granite house , and the colonists employed themselves in rendering their heavy cart lighter and more manageable .",17
but his wound had rendered him too weak to support such an exertion .,4
"during a long interval of prostration , which rendered him almost unconscious , cyrus harding and gideon spilett attentively observed the condition of the dying man .",8
was it possible to render any aid to the dying man ?,4
"but m. de treville promised this favor after a novitiate of two years -- a novitiate which might besides be abridged if an opportunity should present itself for d’artagnan to render the king any signal service , or to distinguish himself by some brilliant action .",30
""" you do not understand me , gentlemen , "" said d’artagnan , throwing up his head , the sharp and bold lines of which were at the moment gilded by a bright ray of the sun . "" i asked to be excused in case i should not be able to discharge my debt to all three ; for monsieur athos has the right to kill me first , which must much diminish the face - value of your bill , monsieur porthos , and render yours almost null , monsieur aramis .",86
""" i was then right in saying , "" exclaimed the sailor , "" that even after his death the captain would render us a last service . """,22
"this mysterious shade , spread over his whole person , rendered still more interesting the man whose eyes or mouth , even in the most complete intoxication , had never revealed anything , however skillfully questions had been put to him .",10
"according to the engineer 's calculation , the mercurial column of a fahrenheit thermometer would not have marked less than eight degrees below zero , and this intense cold , rendered still more painful by a sharp gale , lasted for several days .",30

"feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellised panes , and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around ; the eye , however , struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber , or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling .",16
"having filled them with water and rendered their edges adhesive by means of a little clay , he thus fabricated a regular burning - glass , which , concentrating the solar rays on some very dry moss , soon caused it to blaze .",6

"i repeat it : there is no other way ; and undoubtedly enough of love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your eyes . """,20
"it was , therefore , possible to prevent them , but any enterprise to clear the island was now rendered difficult by reason of herbert 's condition .",19
"his warm and fickle imagination , which in gascony had rendered formidable to young chambermaids , and even sometimes their mistresses , had never dreamed , even in moments of delirium , of half the amorous wonders or a quarter of the feats of gallantry which were here set forth in connection with names the best known and with details the least concealed .",10
"that renders it useless to get a pleurisy by too much haste . """,1
""" do not exaggerate the service i have the happiness to render your majesty . i have nothing to save for your majesty ; you are only the victim of perfidious plots . """,11
"two difficulties remained ; firstly , the possibility of lighting this excavation in the midst of solid rock ; secondly , the necessity of rendering the means of access more easy .",24
"as to the road in question , the choice of trees had rendered its direction somewhat capricious , but at the same time it facilitated the access to a large part of the serpentine peninsula .",12
"he discovered wonderful stories , also , about jewels . in alphonso 's clericalis disciplina a serpent was mentioned with eyes of real jacinth , and in the romantic history of alexander , the conqueror of emathia was said to have found in the vale of jordan snakes "" with collars of real emeralds growing on their backs . "" there was a gem in the brain of the dragon , philostratus told us , and "" by the exhibition of golden letters and a scarlet robe "" the monster could be thrown into a magical sleep and slain . according to the great alchemist , pierre de boniface , the diamond rendered a man invisible , and the agate of india made him eloquent . the cornelian appeased anger , and the hyacinth provoked sleep , and the amethyst drove away the fumes of wine . the garnet cast out demons , and the hydropicus deprived the moon of her colour . the selenite waxed and waned with the moon , and the meloceus , that discovers thieves , could be affected only by the blood of kids . leonardus camillus had seen a white stone taken from the brain of a newly killed toad , that was a certain antidote against poison . the bezoar , that was found in the heart of the arabian deer , was a charm that could cure the plague . in the nests of arabian birds was the aspilates , that , according to democritus , kept the wearer from any danger by fire .",112

"the smoke from the fireplace was also driven back through the opening , filling the passages and rendering them uninhabitable .",17
""" all this seems strange to you , "" continued holmes , "" because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you . i had the good fortune to seize upon that , and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition , and , indeed , was the logical sequence of it . hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure , have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions . it is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery . the most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn . this murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those outré and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable . these strange details , far from making the case more difficult , have really had the effect of making it less so .

""" by an outside ladder , "" replied cyrus harding , "" a rope ladder , which , once drawn up , will render access to our dwelling impossible . """,23
"i would draw your attention also to an entirely physical cause , which renders the southern colder than the northern hemisphere .",13
""" and why not ? may we not depend upon electric phenomena to give us light ? may we not even expect light from the atmosphere , the pressure of which may render it luminous as we approach the centre ? """,32
"the blowing operation had given a cylinder of glass terminated by two hemispheric caps , which were easily detached by means of a sharp iron dipped in cold water ; then , by the same proceeding , this cylinder was cut lengthways , and after having been rendered malleable by a second heating , it was extended on a plate and spread out with a wooden roller .",47
""" sexto and last , "" conseil said , "" the plectognaths , whose maxillary bone is firmly attached to the side of the intermaxillary that forms the jaw , and whose palate arch is locked to the skull by sutures that render the jaw immovable , an order lacking true pelvic fins and which consists of two families . examples : puffers and moonfish .

"assisted by cyrus harding , he proceeded to render the aid herbert required .",8
""" then if through excess of love i have rendered myself culpable toward you , you will pardon me ? """,9

my very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered presentable .,8
"however , the sailor thought that by stopping - up some of the openings with a mixture of stones and sand , the chimneys could be rendered habitable .",26
"then , as if to render an account to herself of the changes she could place upon her countenance , so mobile and so expressive , she made it take all expressions from that of passionate anger , which convulsed her features , to that of the most sweet , most affectionate , and most seducing smile .",5
"a few things from the wreck floated on the surface of the water , a raft could be seen consisting of spare spars , coops of poultry with their occupants still living , boxes and barrels , which gradually came to the surface , after having escaped through the hatchways , but no pieces of the wreck appeared , neither planks from the deck , nor timber from the hull,--which rendered the sudden disappearance of the "" speedy "" perfectly inexplicable .",70
"they had to profit by the low tide to cross the channel , and it was agreed that they would construct , for this purpose , as well as they could , a boat which would render communication so much easier , and would also permit them to ascend the mercy , at the time of their grand exploration of the southwest of the island , which was put off till the first fine days .",36
"for five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he had already traversed on horseback . at night he flung himself down among the rocks , and snatched a few hours of sleep ; but before daybreak he was always well on his way . on the sixth day , he reached the eagle cañon , from which they had commenced their ill - fated flight . thence he could look down upon the home of the saints . worn and exhausted , he leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him . as he looked at it , he observed that there were flags in some of the principal streets , and other signs of festivity . he was still speculating as to what this might mean when he heard the clatter of horse 's hoofs , and saw a mounted man riding towards him . as he approached , he recognized him as a mormon named cowper , to whom he had rendered services at different times . he therefore accosted him when he got up to him , with the object of finding out what lucy ferrier 's fate had been .",176
"in fact , the waterfall created by the explosion rendered the construction of two bridges necessary , one on prospect heights , the other on the shore .",9
"under the trees , thanks to the thickness of their foliage , the obscurity rendered any object invisible beyond a radius of from thirty to forty feet .",14
""" work then without disputing , "" said martin ; "" it is the only way to render life supportable . """,17
""" yes , and it was the last service he desired to render us before his death ! """,12
"you are aware that my plan in bringing up these girls is , not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence , but to render them hardy , patient , self - denying .",26
"pencroft 's first care , after unloading the raft , was to render the cave habitable by stopping up all the holes which made it draughty .",12
