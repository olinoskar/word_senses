"the stream widened as they went further on , till at length it passed under one of the frightful rocks , whose summits seemed to reach the clouds .",1
"here our two travelers had the courage to commit themselves to the stream , which , contracting in this part , hurried them along with a dreadful noise and rapidity .",12
"before i could reply , white smoke streamed from the battleship 's bow . then , a few seconds later , the waters splashed astern of the nautilus , disturbed by the fall of a heavy object . soon after , an explosion struck my ears .",7
"the vast liquid plain , lashed without mercy by the storm , appeared as if covered with herds of furious chargers , whose white and disheveled crests were streaming in the wind .",28
"the road between prospect heights and the sources of the stream was already partly beaten , and with a better cart than the first , the material could be easily conveyed to the spot , especially if they could manage to capture some animals to draw it .",10
"the engineer had observed that it was increased by numerous affluents , but they were unnavigable , being simply little streams .",20
""" and you do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream ?",12
"after the exhaustion of the basalt , the volcano , the power of which grew by the extinction of the lesser craters , supplied an egress to lava , ashes , and scoriae , of which i could see lengthened screes streaming down the sides of the mountain like flowing hair .",41
"it was an insane idea . fortunately i controlled myself and stretched out on the bed to soothe my bodily agitation . my nerves calmed a little , but with my brain so aroused , i did a swift review of my whole existence aboard the nautilus , every pleasant or unpleasant incident that had crossed my path since i went overboard from the abraham lincoln : the underwater hunting trip , the torres strait , our running aground , the savages of papua , the coral cemetery , the suez passageway , the island of santorini , the cretan diver , the bay of vigo , atlantis , the ice bank , the south pole , our imprisonment in the ice , the battle with the devilfish , the storm in the gulf stream , the avenger , and that horrible scene of the vessel sinking with its crew . . . ! all these events passed before my eyes like backdrops unrolling upstage in a theater . in this strange setting captain nemo then grew fantastically . his features were accentuated , taking on superhuman proportions . he was no longer my equal , he was the man of the waters , the spirit of the seas .",134
"at that instant i was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab . instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up , something was screamed to the driver , and the cab flew madly off down regent street . holmes looked eagerly round for another , but no empty one was in sight . then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic , but the start was too great , and already the cab was out of sight .",77
"day had returned . no ray of light penetrated into the profundity of the cavern . it being high - water , the entrance was closed by the sea . but the artificial light , which escaped in long streams from the skylights of the "" nautilus "" was as vivid as before , and the sheet of water shone around the floating vessel .",39
""" consent , then , to his demand is possible : but for one item -- one dreadful item . it is -- that he asks me to be his wife , and has no more of a husband 's heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock , down which the stream is foaming in yonder gorge .",54
"this stream of electricity dazzled my eyes , and after momentarily shutting them , i looked around . the nautilus was stationary . it was floating next to an embankment shaped like a wharf . as for the water now buoying the ship , it was a lake completely encircled by an inner wall about two miles in diameter , hence six miles around . its level -- as indicated by the pressure gauge -- would be the same as the outside level , because some connection had to exist between this lake and the sea . slanting inward over their base , these high walls converged to form a vault shaped like an immense upside - down funnel that measured 500 or 600 meters in height . at its summit there gaped the circular opening through which i had detected that faint glimmer , obviously daylight .",1
"of course the little stream which fed the reservoir of granite house and worked the lift , had been carefully preserved , and the water could not fail .",4
"ned land went westward up the coast ; then , fording some stream beds , he reached open plains that were bordered by wonderful forests . some kingfishers lurked along the watercourses , but they did n't let us approach . their cautious behavior proved to me that these winged creatures knew where they stood on bipeds of our species , and i concluded that if this island was n't inhabited , at least human beings paid it frequent visits .",12
"a sandy beach unfolded before us , measuring 500 feet at its widest point between the waters of the lake and the foot of the mountain 's walls . via this strand you could easily circle the lake . but the base of these high walls consisted of broken soil over which there lay picturesque piles of volcanic blocks and enormous pumice stones . all these crumbling masses were covered with an enamel polished by the action of underground fires , and they glistened under the stream of electric light from our beacon . stirred up by our footsteps , the mica - rich dust on this beach flew into the air like a cloud of sparks .",86
""" yes , sir . we 're shut up in a relatively confined area . if the nautilus 's pumps continually injected streams of boiling water into this space , would n't that raise its temperature and delay its freezing ? """,22
"i had risen half - an - hour before her entrance , and had washed my face , and put on my clothes by the light of a half - moon just setting , whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib .",36
"but i tell you -- and you may mark my words -- you will come some day to a craggy pass in the channel , where the whole of life 's stream will be broken up into whirl and tumult , foam and noise : either you will be dashed to atoms on crag points , or lifted up and borne on by some master - wave into a calmer current -- as i am now .",31
"all on board feared that it could not be done , and every one -- phileas fogg , no doubt , excepted -- felt his heart beat with impatience . the boat must keep up an average of nine miles an hour , and the wind was becoming calmer every moment ! it was a capricious breeze , coming from the coast , and after it passed the sea became smooth . still , the tankadere was so light , and her fine sails caught the fickle zephyrs so well , that , with the aid of the currents john bunsby found himself at six o'clock not more than ten miles from the mouth of shanghai river . shanghai itself is situated at least twelve miles up the stream . at seven they were still three miles from shanghai . the pilot swore an angry oath ; the reward of two hundred pounds was evidently on the point of escaping him . he looked at mr . fogg . mr . fogg was perfectly tranquil ; and yet his whole fortune was at this moment at stake .",128
"the liquid column had indeed disappeared , to give place to dense and still boiling eruptive matter of all kinds . the temperature was becoming unbearable . a thermometer exposed to this atmosphere would have marked 150 Â° . the perspiration streamed from my body . but for the rapidity of our ascent we should have been suffocated .",41
"he had better have said slide , for we did nothing but drop down the steep inclines . it was the facifs _ descensus averni _ of virgil . the compass , which i consulted frequently , gave our direction as south - east with inflexible steadiness . this lava stream deviated neither to the right nor to the left .",50
""" nor that either , "" he answered . "" this is no northern mountain ; here are no granite peaks capped with snow . look , axel , look ! "" above our heads , at a height of five hundred feet or more , we saw the crater of a volcano , through which , at intervals of fifteen minutes or so , there issued with loud explosions lofty columns of fire , mingled with pumice stones , ashes , and flowing lava . i could feel the heaving of the mountain , which seemed to breathe like a huge whale , and puff out fire and wind from its vast blowholes . beneath , down a pretty steep declivity , ran streams of lava for eight or nine hundred feet , giving the mountain a height of about 1,300 or 1,400 feet . but the base of the mountain was hidden in a perfect bower of rich verdure , amongst which i was able to distinguish the olive , the fig , and vines , covered with their luscious purple bunches .",124
"i attach a print of the positive . in it you can view these primordial rocks that have never seen the light of day , this nether granite that forms the powerful foundation of our globe , the deep caves cut into the stony mass , the outlines of incomparable distinctness whose far edges stand out in black as if from the brush of certain flemish painters . in the distance is a mountainous horizon , a wondrously undulating line that makes up the background of this landscape . the general effect of these smooth rocks is indescribable : black , polished , without moss or other blemish , carved into strange shapes , sitting firmly on a carpet of sand that sparkled beneath our streams of electric light .",125
"for this , it was enough to augment the flow of the little stream which supplied the interior of granite house with water .",13
"felton arrived at the palace of the admiralty , covered with dust , and streaming with perspiration .",14
"the order was now given "" to the garden ! "" each put on a coarse straw bonnet , with strings of coloured calico , and a cloak of grey frieze . i was similarly equipped , and , following the stream , i made my way into the open air .",41
"it was a warm june morning , and the latter day saints were as busy as the bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem . in the fields and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry . down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavily - laden mules , all heading to the west , for the gold fever had broken out in california , and the overland route lay through the city of the elect . there , too , were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands , and trains of tired immigrants , men and horses equally weary of their interminable journey . through all this motley assemblage , threading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider , there galloped lucy ferrier , her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out behind her . she had a commission from her father in the city , and was dashing in as she had done many a time before , with all the fearlessness of youth , thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed . the travel - stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment , and even the unemotional indians , journeying in with their pelties , relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale - faced maiden .",49
"he turned round , and leaning upon his elbow , began to sip his chocolate . the mellow november sun came streaming into the room . the sky was bright , and there was a genial warmth in the air . it was almost like a morning in may .",21
""" that is just the question . have we followed that road ? did saknussemm meet this sheet of water ? did he cross it ? has not the stream that we followed led us altogether astray ? """,29
""" i see a little river which runs into it , "" said herbert , pointing out a narrow stream , which evidently took its source somewhere in the west .",19
"two hundred paces farther they arrived at the cutting , through which , as pencroft had guessed , ran a stream of water , whether fresh or not was to be ascertained .",20
"having breakfasted , mr . fogg and his companions resumed their places in the car , and observed the varied landscape which unfolded itself as they passed along the vast prairies , the mountains lining the horizon , and the creeks , with their frothy , foaming streams . sometimes a great herd of buffaloes , massing together in the distance , seemed like a moveable dam . these innumerable multitudes of ruminating beasts often form an insurmountable obstacle to the passage of the trains ; thousands of them have been seen passing over the track for hours together , in compact ranks . the locomotive is then forced to stop and wait till the road is once more clear .",47
""" what has she written to me ? "" said buckingham , feebly , streaming with blood , and suppressing his agony to speak of her he loved , "" what has she written to me ?",14
"guided by his skillful hands , the nautilus passed by all these different masses of ice , which are classified by size and shape with a precision that enraptured conseil : "" icebergs , "" or mountains ; "" ice fields , "" or smooth , limitless tracts ; "" drift ice , "" or floating floes ; "" packs , "" or broken tracts , called "" patches "" when they 're circular and "" streams "" when they form long strips .",76
"just then the gulf stream 's speed was 2.25 meters per second . so distinct is its current from the surrounding sea , its confined waters stand out against the ocean and operate on a different level from the colder waters . murky as well , and very rich in saline material , their pure indigo contrasts with the green waves surrounding them . moreover , their line of demarcation is so clear that abreast of the carolinas , the nautilus 's spur cut the waves of the gulf stream while its propeller was still churning those belonging to the ocean .",4

"i might add that during the night , the gulf stream 's phosphorescent waters rivaled the electric glow of our beacon , especially in the stormy weather that frequently threatened us .",10
"at last on march 18 , after twenty futile assaults , the nautilus was decisively held in check . no longer was it an ice stream , patch , or field -- it was an endless , immovable barrier formed by ice mountains fused to each other .",25
"on the declivity of the atlantic basin the first streams , branches of the north platte river , already appeared . the whole northern and eastern horizon was bounded by the immense semi - circular curtain which is formed by the southern portion of the rocky mountains , the highest being laramie peak . between this and the railway extended vast plains , plentifully irrigated . on the right rose the lower spurs of the mountainous mass which extends southward to the sources of the arkansas river , one of the great tributaries of the missouri .",9
"soon it became evident that if we continued our walk we should widen the distance between ourselves and the stream , the noise of which was becoming fainter .",19
"felton listened without uttering any word or sound , except an inward expression of agony . the sweat streamed down his marble forehead , and his hand , under his coat , tore his breast .",18
"the blaze there has thawed all the snow from your cloak ; by the same token , it has streamed on to my floor , and made it like a trampled street .",19
""" why should we trouble ourselves to stop the stream from coming out at all ? """,9
"oh , that gulf stream ! it truly lives up to its nickname , the lord of storms ! all by itself it creates these fearsome cyclones through the difference in temperature between its currents and the superimposed layers of air .",4
"she was a big woman , and had long black hair : we could see it streaming against the flames as she stood . i witnessed , and several more witnessed , mr . rochester ascend through the sky - light on to the roof ; we heard him call ' bertha ! '",16
""" a wind fresh from europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the open casement : the storm broke , streamed , thundered , blazed , and the air grew pure . i then framed and fixed a resolution .",21
"from two openings in its southern and eastern sides an unceasing flow of lava poured forth , thus forming two distinct streams .",21
"some heavy clouds , swept from the sky by a rising wind , had left the moon bare ; and her light , streaming in through a window near , shone full both on us and on the approaching figure , which we at once recognised as miss temple .",23
