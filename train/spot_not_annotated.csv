"by december 15 we had left the alluring society islands in the west , likewise elegant tahiti , queen of the pacific . in the morning i spotted this island 's lofty summits a few miles to leeward . its waters supplied excellent fish for the tables on board : mackerel , bonito , albacore , and a few varieties of that sea serpent named the moray eel .",27
"after examining this community of walruses , i decided to return in my tracks . it was eleven o'clock , and if captain nemo found conditions favorable for taking his sights , i wanted to be present at the operation . but i held no hopes that the sun would make an appearance that day . it was hidden from our eyes by clouds squeezed together on the horizon . apparently the jealous orb did n't want to reveal this inaccessible spot on the globe to any human being .",81
"if the convicts were hid in one spot of the island , if we knew that spot , and had only to dislodge them , i would undertake a direct attack ; but is there not occasion to fear , on the contrary , that they are sure to fire the first shot ? """,7
"their size exceeded that of a rabbit , their hair was yellow , mingled with green spots , and they had the merest rudiments of tails .",16
"her countenance , with surprising mobility , had recovered its gracious expression ; but some little red spots on her handkerchief indicated that she had bitten her lips till the blood came .",17
"the road between prospect heights and the sources of the stream was already partly beaten , and with a better cart than the first , the material could be easily conveyed to the spot , especially if they could manage to capture some animals to draw it .",33
"besides , there were fewer to feed ; the sick could eat little ; our breakfast - basins were better filled ; when there was no time to prepare a regular dinner , which often happened , she would give us a large piece of cold pie , or a thick slice of bread and cheese , and this we carried away with us to the wood , where we each chose the spot we liked best , and dined sumptuously .",73
the voyagers could distinctly see that solid spot which they must reach at any cost .,7
"only , after carefully examining them , pencroft found on the forehead of one , on the chest of another , on the back of this one , on the shoulder of that , a little red spot , a sort of scarcely visible bruise , the cause of which it was impossible to conjecture .",37
"when d’artagnan arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which extended along the foot of the monastery , athos had been waiting about five minutes , and twelve o’clock was striking .",8
"we had been left to ourselves for twenty minutes , trying to detect the tiniest noises inside the nautilus , when captain nemo entered . he did n't seem to see us . his facial features , usually so emotionless , revealed a certain uneasiness . he studied the compass and pressure gauge in silence , then went and put his finger on the world map at a spot in the sector depicting the southernmost seas .",68
"i could barely glimpse the swift passing of longnose sharks , hammerhead sharks , spotted dogfish that frequent these waters , big eagle rays , swarms of seahorse looking like knights on a chessboard , eels quivering like fireworks serpents , armies of crab that fled obliquely by crossing their pincers over their carapaces , finally schools of porpoise that held contests of speed with the nautilus . but by this point observing , studying , and classifying were out of the question .",14
"besides , he feared that by resisting longer he should appear selfish in the eyes of athos . he acquiesced , therefore , and chose the hundred pistoles , which the englishman paid down on the spot .",36
"rance resumed his seat , without however losing his mystified expression . "" i went back to the gate and sounded my whistle . that brought murcher and two more to the spot . """,32
"this same morning , the 26th of march , at daybreak , neb had set out on the shore in a northerly direction , and he had returned to the spot where the sea , no doubt , had closed over the unfortunate harding .",30
suddenly a noise from the ship 's interior became audible . voices were answering each other hurriedly . what was it ? had they spotted our escape ? i felt ned land sliding a dagger into my hand .,24
"d’artagnan was passing along a lane on the spot where the rue d’assas is now situated , breathing the balmy emanations which were borne upon the wind from the rue de vaugirard , and which arose from the gardens refreshed by the dews of evening and the breeze of night .",8
"those piles of stones just mentioned were laid out on the ocean floor with a distinct but inexplicable symmetry . i spotted gigantic furrows trailing off into the distant darkness , their length incalculable . there also were other peculiarities i could n't make sense of . it seemed to me that my heavy lead soles were crushing a litter of bones that made a dry crackling noise . so what were these vast plains we were now crossing ? i wanted to ask the captain , but i still did n't grasp that sign language that allowed him to chat with his companions when they went with him on his underwater excursions .",21
""" not yet . i have n't let the nautilus pull too near the coast , and we 're fairly well out from the mannar oysterbank . but i have the skiff ready , and it will take us to the exact spot where we 'll disembark , which will save us a pretty long trek . it 's carrying our diving equipment , and we 'll suit up just before we begin our underwater exploring . """,42
"between the forest and this accursed spot , a little behind the trampled ground , was the same track of small feet as in the garden ; the carriage had stopped here .",6
"d’artagnan remained fixed to the spot , astounded and not knowing what to think .",5
at the moment of arriving at st . paul -- the spot where such as were condemned at the bastille were executed -- he was near fainting and crossed himself twice .,11
"i sought a seat for him in a hidden and lovely spot , a dry stump of a tree ; nor did i refuse to let him , when seated , place me on his knee .",11
"indeed , the carriage crossed the fatal spot without stopping .",7
"ten minutes later , captain nemo stopped suddenly . i thought he 'd called a halt so that we could turn and start back . no . with a gesture he ordered us to crouch beside him at the foot of a wide crevice . his hand motioned toward a spot within the liquid mass , and i looked carefully .",50
"besides , it came into the young man ’s mind that by remaining in the environs of the spot on which this sad event had passed , he would , perhaps , have some light thrown upon the mysterious affair .",18
"he remained on the bench , with his back leaning against the wall and his hands hanging down , exactly on the spot where the guards placed him .",22
"when i awoke next morning that indefatigable worker was still at his post . his red eyes , his pale complexion , his hair tangled between his feverish fingers , the red spots on his cheeks , revealed his desperate struggle with impossibilities , and the weariness of spirit , the mental wrestlings he must have undergone all through that unhappy night .",32
""" no , professor , but it needs electricity to run , batteries to generate its electricity , sodium to feed its batteries , coal to make its sodium , and coalfields from which to dig its coal . now then , right at this spot the sea covers entire forests that sank underwater in prehistoric times ; today , turned to stone , transformed into carbon fuel , they offer me inexhaustible coal mines . """,45
"but when we had ascended to an elevation of about 250 feet , we were stopped by insurmountable obstacles . the converging inside walls changed into overhangs , and our climb into a circular stroll . at this topmost level the vegetable kingdom began to challenge the mineral kingdom . shrubs , and even a few trees , emerged from crevices in the walls . i recognized some spurges that let their caustic , purgative sap trickle out . there were heliotropes , very remiss at living up to their sun - worshipping reputations since no sunlight ever reached them ; their clusters of flowers drooped sadly , their colors and scents were faded . here and there chrysanthemums sprouted timidly at the feet of aloes with long , sad , sickly leaves . but between these lava flows i spotted little violets that still gave off a subtle fragrance , and i confess that i inhaled it with delight . the soul of a flower is its scent , and those splendid water plants , flowers of the sea , have no souls !",140
"having reached a spot about twenty feet from the edge of the beach , and nearly five hundred feet from the cliff , which rose perpendicularly , harding thrust the pole two feet into the sand , and wedging it up carefully , he managed , by means of the plumb - line , to erect it perpendicularly with the plane of the horizon .",3
"in the first place he had made rough work of it ; one man was killed on the spot , and two others were severely wounded .",18
"but if my desires were fulfilled by the capture of this bird of paradise , those of our canadian huntsman remained unsatisfied . luckily , near two o'clock ned land brought down a magnificent wild pig of the type the natives call "" bari - outang . "" this animal came in the nick of time for us to bag some real quadruped meat , and it was warmly welcomed . ned land proved himself quite gloriously with his gunshot . hit by an electric bullet , the pig dropped dead on the spot .",93
"but ned land was not mistaken , and we all spotted the object his hand was indicating .",10
"the yellow color of its hair was relieved by streaks and regular oblong spots of black , which contrasted with the white of its chest .",13
"as for fish , they were numerous and often remarkable . here are the ones that the nautilus 's nets most frequently hauled on board : rays , including spotted rays that were oval in shape and brick red in color , their bodies strewn with erratic blue speckles and identifiable by their jagged double stings , silver - backed skates , common stingrays with stippled tails , butterfly rays that looked like huge two - meter cloaks flapping at middepth , toothless guitarfish that were a type of cartilaginous fish closer to the shark , trunkfish known as dromedaries that were one and a half feet long and had humps ending in backward - curving stings , serpentine moray eels with silver tails and bluish backs plus brown pectorals trimmed in gray piping , a species of butterfish called the fiatola decked out in thin gold stripes and the three colors of the french flag , montague blennies four decimeters long , superb jacks handsomely embellished by seven black crosswise streaks with blue and yellow fins plus gold and silver scales , snooks , standard mullet with yellow heads , parrotfish , wrasse , triggerfish , gobies , etc . , plus a thousand other fish common to the oceans we had already crossed .",29
""" consul , "" said he , "" i have no longer any doubt . i have spotted my man . he passes himself off as an odd stick who is going round the world in eighty days . """,17
"among these birds , which were about the size of a fowl , the female was uniformly brown , while the male was gorgeous in his red plumage , decorated with white spots .",32
"was this barren spot the desolate refuge of sea - birds , strewn with stones and destitute of vegetation , attached to a more important archipelago ?",3
"for an entire hour i was deep in these musings , trying to probe this mystery that fascinated me so . then my eyes focused on a huge world map displayed on the table , and i put my finger on the very spot where our just - determined longitude and latitude intersected .",43
"while grazing these rocky slopes lost under the waters , i still spotted some seashells , tube worms , lively annelid worms from the genus spirorbis , and certain starfish specimens .",12
""" have n't seen or heard a thing ! "" the canadian replied . "" i have n't even spotted the crew of this boat . by any chance , could they be electric too ? """,19
"they did not even think of taking a minute 's rest . forgetting everything but their chief , hoping or wishing to hope on , they continued to walk up and down on this sterile spot , always returning to its northern point , where they could approach nearest to the scene of the catastrophe .",35
"some zoophytes were dredged up by the chain of our trawl . most were lovely sea anemone belonging to the family actinidia , including among other species , the phyctalis protexta , native to this part of the ocean : a small cylindrical trunk adorned with vertical lines , mottled with red spots , and crowned by a wondrous blossoming of tentacles . as for mollusks , they consisted of exhibits i had already observed : turret snails , olive shells of the "" tent olive "" species with neatly intersecting lines and russet spots standing out sharply against a flesh - colored background , fanciful spider conchs that looked like petrified scorpions , transparent glass snails , argonauts , some highly edible cuttlefish , and certain species of squid that the naturalists of antiquity classified with the flying fish , which are used chiefly as bait for catching cod .",52

"the canadian was not mistaken . cavorting around the nautilus was a school of triggerfish with flat bodies , grainy skins , armed with stings on their dorsal fins , and with four prickly rows of quills quivering on both sides of their tails . nothing could have been more wonderful than the skin covering them : white underneath , gray above , with spots of gold sparkling in the dark eddies of the waves . around them , rays were undulating like sheets flapping in the wind , and among these i spotted , much to my glee , a chinese ray , yellowish on its topside , a dainty pink on its belly , and armed with three stings behind its eyes ; a rare species whose very existence was still doubted in lacépède 's day , since that pioneering classifier of fish had seen one only in a portfolio of japanese drawings .",93
"for two hours a whole aquatic army escorted the nautilus . in the midst of their leaping and cavorting , while they competed with each other in beauty , radiance , and speed , i could distinguish some green wrasse , bewhiskered mullet marked with pairs of black lines , white gobies from the genus eleotris with curved caudal fins and violet spots on the back , wonderful japanese mackerel from the genus scomber with blue bodies and silver heads , glittering azure goldfish whose name by itself gives their full description , several varieties of porgy or gilthead ( some banded gilthead with fins variously blue and yellow , some with horizontal heraldic bars and enhanced by a black strip around their caudal area , some with color zones and elegantly corseted in their six waistbands ) , trumpetfish with flutelike beaks that looked like genuine seafaring woodcocks and were sometimes a meter long , japanese salamanders , serpentine moray eels from the genus echidna that were six feet long with sharp little eyes and a huge mouth bristling with teeth ; etc .",62
"i soon found the place i was in was not fit for my settlement , because it was upon a low , moorish ground , near the sea , and i believed it would not be wholesome , and more particularly because there was no fresh water near it ; so i resolved to find a more healthy and more convenient spot of ground . i consulted several things in my situation , which i found would he proper for me : 1st , health and fresh water , i just now mentioned ; 2ndly , shelter from the heat of the sun ; 3rdly , security from ravenous creatures , whether man or beast ; 4thly , a view to the sea , that if god sent any ship in sight , i might not lose any advantage for my deliverance , of which i was not willing to banish all my expectation yet .",61

"from eight to nine o'clock , the nautilus stayed a few meters beneath the waters . according to my calculations , we had to be quite close to suez . through the panels in the lounge , i spotted rocky bottoms brightly lit by our electric rays . it seemed to me that the strait was getting narrower and narrower .",38
"they had decided to make the tour of the island on foot , before exploring the interior ; so that not a spot should escape their investigations .",22

"what a struggle ! ned land quickly grew enthusiastic and even ended up applauding . brandished in its captain 's hands , the nautilus was simply a fearsome harpoon . he hurled it at those fleshy masses and ran them clean through , leaving behind two squirming animal halves . as for those daunting strokes of the tail hitting our sides , the ship never felt them . no more than the collisions it caused . one sperm whale exterminated , it ran at another , tacked on the spot so as not to miss its prey , went ahead or astern , obeyed its rudder , dived when the cetacean sank to deeper strata , rose with it when it returned to the surface , struck it head - on or slantwise , hacked at it or tore it , and from every direction and at any speed , skewered it with its dreadful spur .",89

"the blubber , cut in parallel slices of two feet and a half in thickness , then divided into pieces which might weigh about a thousand pounds each , was melted down in large earthen pots brought to the spot , for they did not wish to taint the environs of granite house , and in this fusion it lost nearly a third of its weight .",39
"we had been gone from the nautilus for about an hour and a half . it was almost noon . i spotted this fact in the perpendicularity of the sun 's rays , which were no longer refracted . the magic of these solar colors disappeared little by little , with emerald and sapphire shades vanishing from our surroundings altogether . we walked with steady steps that rang on the seafloor with astonishing intensity . the tiniest sounds were transmitted with a speed to which the ear is unaccustomed on shore . in fact , water is a better conductor of sound than air , and under the waves noises carry four times as fast .",21

"the next day , june 1 , the nautilus kept to the same tack . it was obviously trying to locate some precise spot in the ocean . just as on the day before , captain nemo came to take the altitude of the sun . the sea was smooth , the skies clear . eight miles to the east , a big steamship was visible on the horizon line . no flag was flapping from the gaff of its fore - and - aft sail , and i could n't tell its nationality .",23

"in the midst of the watery mass , brightly lit by our electric beams , there snaked past those one - meter lampreys that are common to nearly every clime . a type of ray from the genus oxyrhynchus , five feet wide , had a white belly with a spotted , ash - gray back and was carried along by the currents like a huge , wide - open shawl . other rays passed by so quickly i could n't tell if they deserved that name "" eagle ray "" coined by the ancient greeks , or those designations of "" rat ray , "" "" bat ray , "" and "" toad ray "" that modern fishermen have inflicted on them . dogfish known as topes , twelve feet long and especially feared by divers , were racing with each other . looking like big bluish shadows , thresher sharks went by , eight feet long and gifted with an extremely acute sense of smell . dorados from the genus sparus , some measuring up to thirteen decimeters , appeared in silver and azure costumes encircled with ribbons , which contrasted with the dark color of their fins ; fish sacred to the goddess venus , their eyes set in brows of gold ; a valuable species that patronizes all waters fresh or salt , equally at home in rivers , lakes , and oceans , living in every clime , tolerating any temperature , their line dating back to prehistoric times on this earth yet preserving all its beauty from those far - off days . magnificent sturgeons , nine to ten meters long and extremely fast , banged their powerful tails against the glass of our panels , showing bluish backs with small brown spots ; they resemble sharks , without equaling their strength , and are encountered in every sea ; in the spring they delight in swimming up the great rivers , fighting the currents of the volga , danube , po , rhine , loire , and oder , while feeding on herring , mackerel , salmon , and codfish ; although they belong to the class of cartilaginous fish , they rate as a delicacy ; they 're eaten fresh , dried , marinated , or salt - preserved , and in olden times they were borne in triumph to the table of the roman epicure lucullus . but whenever the nautilus drew near the surface , those denizens of the mediterranean i could observe most productively belonged to the sixty - third genus of bony fish . these were tuna from the genus scomber , blue - black on top , silver on the belly armor , their dorsal stripes giving off a golden gleam . they are said to follow ships in search of refreshing shade from the hot tropical sun , and they did just that with the nautilus , as they had once done with the vessels of the count de la pérouse . for long hours they competed in speed with our submersible . i could n't stop marveling at these animals so perfectly cut out for racing , their heads small , their bodies sleek , spindle - shaped , and in some cases over three meters long , their pectoral fins gifted with remarkable strength , their caudal fins forked . like certain flocks of birds , whose speed they equal , these tuna swim in triangle formation , which prompted the ancients to say they 'd boned up on geometry and military strategy . and yet they ca n't escape the provençal fishermen , who prize them as highly as did the ancient inhabitants of turkey and italy ; and these valuable animals , as oblivious as if they were deaf and blind , leap right into the marseilles tuna nets and perish by the thousands .",50

"for his part , conseil thought he spotted a turtle six feet wide and adorned with three protruding ridges that ran lengthwise . i was sorry to miss this reptile , because from conseil 's description , i believe i recognized the leatherback turtle , a pretty rare species . for my part , i noted only some loggerhead turtles with long carapaces .",7

"during that day a fearsome school of sharks provided us with an escort . dreadful animals that teem in these seas and make them extremely dangerous . there were port jackson sharks with a brown back , a whitish belly , and eleven rows of teeth , bigeye sharks with necks marked by a large black spot encircled in white and resembling an eye , and isabella sharks whose rounded snouts were strewn with dark speckles . often these powerful animals rushed at the lounge window with a violence less than comforting . by this point ned land had lost all self - control . he wanted to rise to the surface of the waves and harpoon the monsters , especially certain smooth - hound sharks whose mouths were paved with teeth arranged like a mosaic , and some big five - meter tiger sharks that insisted on personally provoking him . but the nautilus soon picked up speed and easily left astern the fastest of these man - eaters .",56
