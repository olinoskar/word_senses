""" sarah , come and sleep with me in the nursery ; i dare n't for my life be alone with that poor child to - night : she might die ; it 's such a strange thing she should have that fit : i wonder if she saw anything . missis was rather too hard . """,45
""" no , "" she answered , wondering at the harsh simplicity of life .",7
"nothing had changed in its interior arrangements . the prison was still a prison and its prisoners still prisoners . but , taking advantage of our slumber , the steward had cleared the table . consequently , nothing indicated any forthcoming improvement in our situation , and i seriously wondered if we were doomed to spend the rest of our lives in this cage .",49
"there our diving suits were removed , not without difficulty ; and utterly exhausted , faint from lack of food and rest , i repaired to my stateroom , full of wonder at this startling excursion on the bottom of the sea .",31
"the fact is that our friend , the baronet , begins to display a considerable interest in our fair neighbour . it is not to be wondered at , for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an active man like him , and she is a very fascinating and beautiful woman . there is something tropical and exotic about her which forms a singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother . yet he also gives the idea of hidden fires . he has certainly a very marked influence over her , for i have seen her continually glance at him as she talked as if seeking approbation for what she said . i trust that he is kind to her . there is a dry glitter in his eyes , and a firm set of his thin lips , which goes with a positive and possibly a harsh nature . you would find him an interesting study .",26

"luckily for alice , the little magic bottle had now had its full effect , and she grew no larger : still it was very uncomfortable , and , as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again , no wonder she felt unhappy .",49
