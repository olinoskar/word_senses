""" he must have been holding it as a signal , "" said i. "" let us see if there is any answer . "" i held it as he had done , and stared out into the darkness of the night . vaguely i could discern the black bank of the trees and the lighter expanse of the moor , for the moon was behind the clouds . and then i gave a cry of exultation , for a tiny pin - point of yellow light had suddenly transfixed the dark veil , and glowed steadily in the centre of the black square framed by the window .",67,"('cloud', 'nuage', 'nube')",0
"on leaving rejkiavik hans took us by the seashore . we passed lean pastures which were trying very hard , but in vain , to look green ; yellow came out best . the rugged peaks of the trachyte rocks presented faint outlines on the eastern horizon ; at times a few patches of snow , concentrating the vague light , glittered upon the slopes of the distant mountains ; certain peaks , boldly uprising , passed through the grey clouds , and reappeared above the moving mists , like breakers emerging in the heavens .",80,"('cloud', 'nuage', 'nube')",0
"after examining this community of walruses , i decided to return in my tracks . it was eleven o'clock , and if captain nemo found conditions favorable for taking his sights , i wanted to be present at the operation . but i held no hopes that the sun would make an appearance that day . it was hidden from our eyes by clouds squeezed together on the horizon . apparently the jealous orb did n't want to reveal this inaccessible spot on the globe to any human being .",63,"('cloud', 'nuage', 'nube')",0

"there was a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy , and the blue cloud - shadows chased themselves across the grass like swallows . how pleasant it was in the garden ! and how delightful other people 's emotions were!-- much more delightful than their ideas , it seemed to him . one 's own soul , and the passions of one 's friends -- those were the fascinating things in life . he pictured to himself with silent amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long with basil hallward .",19,"('cloud', 'nuage', 'nube')",0

"by nine o'clock we had pulled up to shore . the sky was growing brighter . clouds were fleeing to the south . mists were rising from the cold surface of the water . captain nemo headed toward the peak , which he no doubt planned to make his observatory . it was an arduous climb over sharp lava and pumice stones in the midst of air often reeking with sulfurous fumes from the smoke holes . for a man out of practice at treading land , the captain scaled the steepest slopes with a supple agility i could n't equal , and which would have been envied by hunters of pyrenees mountain goats .",16,"('cloud', 'nuage', 'nube')",0

"and then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had been infused into it concerning heaven and hell ; and for the first time it recoiled , baffled ; and for the first time glancing behind , on each side , and before it , it saw all round an unfathomed gulf : it felt the one point where it stood -- the present ; all the rest was formless cloud and vacant depth ; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering , and plunging amid that chaos .",73,"('cloud', 'nuage', 'nube')",0

""" very good , barrymore . we may talk further of this some other time . "" when the butler had gone i walked over to the black window , and i looked through a blurred pane at the driving clouds and at the tossing outline of the wind - swept trees . it is a wild night indoors , and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor . what passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk in such a place at such a time ! and what deep and earnest purpose can he have which calls for such a trial ! there , in that hut upon the moor , seems to lie the very centre of that problem which has vexed me so sorely . i swear that another day shall not have passed before i have done all that man can do to reach the heart of the mystery .",40,"('cloud', 'nuage', 'nube')",0
"it was a stormy and dark night ; vast clouds covered the heavens , concealing the stars ; the moon would not rise till midnight .",9,"('cloud', 'nuage', 'nube')",0
"we were in reality shut up inside an immeasurable excavation . its width could not be estimated , since the shore ran widening as far as eye could reach , nor could its length , for the dim horizon bounded the new . as for its height , it must have been several leagues . where this vault rested upon its granite base no eye could tell ; but there was a cloud hanging far above , the height of which we estimated at 12,000 feet , a greater height than that of any terrestrial vapour , and no doubt due to the great density of the air .",72,"('cloud', 'nuage', 'nube')",0

"i made no answer , but went and sat forward . the northern shore was already beginning to dip under the horizon . the eastern and western strands spread wide as if to bid us farewell . before our eyes lay far and wide a vast sea ; shadows of great clouds swept heavily over its silver - grey surface ; the glistening bluish rays of electric light , here and there reflected by the dancing drops of spray , shot out little sheaves of light from the track we left in our rear . soon we entirely lost sight of land ; no object was left for the eye to judge by , and but for the frothy track of the raft , i might have thought we were standing still .",51,"('cloud', 'nuage', 'nube')",0

"i drew aside my curtains before i went to bed and looked out from my window . it opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of the hall door . beyond , two copses of trees moaned and swung in a rising wind . a half moon broke through the rifts of racing clouds . in its cold light i saw beyond the trees a broken fringe of rocks , and the long , low curve of the melancholy moor . i closed the curtain , feeling that my last impression was in keeping with the rest .",55,"('cloud', 'nuage', 'nube')",0

"another unusual effect . heavy clouds passed above us , forming and fading swiftly . but after thinking it over , i realized that these so - called clouds were caused simply by the changing densities of the long ground swells , and i even spotted the foaming "" white caps "" that their breaking crests were proliferating over the surface of the water . lastly , i could n't help seeing the actual shadows of large birds passing over our heads , swiftly skimming the surface of the sea .",5,"('cloud', 'nuage', 'nube')",0
