"i would have been deeply interested in visiting this long , 360-league reef , against which the ever - surging sea broke with the fearsome intensity of thunderclaps . but just then the nautilus 's slanting fins took us to great depths , and i could see nothing of those high coral walls . i had to rest content with the various specimens of fish brought up by our nets . among others i noted some long - finned albacore , a species in the genus scomber , as big as tuna , bluish on the flanks , and streaked with crosswise stripes that disappear when the animal dies . these fish followed us in schools and supplied our table with very dainty flesh . we also caught a large number of yellow - green gilthead , half a decimeter long and tasting like dorado , plus some flying gurnards , authentic underwater swallows that , on dark nights , alternately streak air and water with their phosphorescent glimmers . among mollusks and zoophytes , i found in our trawl 's meshes various species of alcyonarian coral , sea urchins , hammer shells , spurred - star shells , wentletrap snails , horn shells , glass snails . the local flora was represented by fine floating algae : sea tangle , and kelp from the genus macrocystis , saturated with the mucilage their pores perspire , from which i selected a wonderful nemastoma geliniaroidea , classifying it with the natural curiosities in the museum .",111

"on march 14 at latitude 55 degrees , i spotted floating ice , plain pale bits of rubble twenty to twenty - five feet long , which formed reefs over which the sea burst into foam . the nautilus stayed on the surface of the ocean . having fished in the arctic seas , ned land was already familiar with the sight of icebergs . conseil and i were marveling at them for the first time .",48
"this current swept along with it a whole host of moving creatures . argonauts , so common in the mediterranean , voyaged here in schools of large numbers . among cartilaginous fish , the most remarkable were rays whose ultra slender tails made up nearly a third of the body , which was shaped like a huge diamond twenty - five feet long ; then little one - meter sharks , the head large , the snout short and rounded , the teeth sharp and arranged in several rows , the body seemingly covered with scales .",31
"the upper part of the mouth of the cetacean was , indeed , provided on both sides with eight hundred horny blades , very elastic , of a fibrous texture , and fringed at the edge like great combs , at which the teeth , six feet long , served to retain the thousands of animalculae , little fish , and molluscs , on which the whale fed .",58
"taste that fowl and those fish . on my honor , they are not poisoned .",5
"these various types of shrubbery were as big as trees in the temperate zones ; in the damp shade between them , there were clustered actual bushes of moving flowers , hedges of zoophytes in which there grew stony coral striped with twisting furrows , yellowish sea anemone from the genus caryophylia with translucent tentacles , plus anemone with grassy tufts from the genus zoantharia ; and to complete the illusion , minnows flitted from branch to branch like a swarm of hummingbirds , while there rose underfoot , like a covey of snipe , yellow fish from the genus lepisocanthus with bristling jaws and sharp scales , flying gurnards , and pinecone fish .",96

"at a depth of ten meters , we walked amid a swarm of small fish from every species , more numerous than birds in the air , more agile too ; but no aquatic game worthy of a gunshot had yet been offered to our eyes .",14
"the water appeared to be full of fish , and pencroft resolved to make some fishing - rods , so as to try and catch some .",7
"sheer chance had placed me in the presence of the most valuable specimens of this zoophyte . this coral was the equal of those fished up from the mediterranean off the barbary coast or the shores of france and italy . with its bright colors , it lived up to those poetic names of blood flower and blood foam that the industry confers on its finest exhibits . coral sells for as much as 500 francs per kilogram , and in this locality the liquid strata hid enough to make the fortunes of a whole host of coral fishermen . this valuable substance often merges with other polyparies , forming compact , hopelessly tangled units known as "" macciota , "" and i noted some wonderful pink samples of this coral .",24
"the nets were hauled on board . they were a breed of trawl resembling those used off the normandy coast , huge pouches held half open by a floating pole and a chain laced through the lower meshes . trailing in this way from these iron glove makers , the resulting receptacles scoured the ocean floor and collected every marine exhibit in their path . that day they gathered up some unusual specimens from these fish - filled waterways : anglerfish whose comical movements qualify them for the epithet "" clowns , "" black commerson anglers equipped with their antennas , undulating triggerfish encircled by little red bands , bloated puffers whose venom is extremely insidious , some olive - hued lampreys , snipefish covered with silver scales , cutlass fish whose electrocuting power equals that of the electric eel and the electric ray , scaly featherbacks with brown crosswise bands , greenish codfish , several varieties of goby , etc . ; finally , some fish of larger proportions : a one - meter jack with a prominent head , several fine bonito from the genus scomber decked out in the colors blue and silver , and three magnificent tuna whose high speeds could n't save them from our trawl .",75

"i estimate that this cast of the net brought in more than 1,000 pounds of fish . it was a fine catch but not surprising . in essence , these nets stayed in our wake for several hours , incarcerating an entire aquatic world in prisons made of thread . so we were never lacking in provisions of the highest quality , which the nautilus 's speed and the allure of its electric light could continually replenish .",15
"among the fish that the nautilus startled on its way , i 'll mention a one - meter lumpfish , blackish on top with orange on the belly and rare among its brethren in that it practices monogamy , a good - sized eelpout , a type of emerald moray whose flavor is excellent , wolffish with big eyes in a head somewhat resembling a canine 's , viviparous blennies whose eggs hatch inside their bodies like those of snakes , bloated gobio ( or black gudgeon ) measuring two decimeters , grenadiers with long tails and gleaming with a silvery glow , speedy fish venturing far from their high arctic seas .",104
"the boxes containing these were in a line upon the shore , in a perfect state of preservation ; for the most part the sea had spared them , and what with biscuits , salt meat , spirits , and salt fish , we might reckon on four months ' supply .",41
""" so count them , conseil . but it would be less work to believe me . besides , frenchmen , englishmen , americans , danes , and norwegians catch these cod by the thousands . they 're eaten in prodigious quantities , and without the astonishing fertility of these fish , the seas would soon be depopulated of them . accordingly , in england and america alone , 5,000 ships manned by 75,000 seamen go after cod . each ship brings back an average catch of 4,400 fish , making 22,000,000 . off the coast of norway , the total is the same .

"the nautilus kept to its southeasterly heading . on december 1 it cut the equator at longitude 142 degrees , and on the 4th of the same month , after a quick crossing marked by no incident , we raised the marquesas islands . three miles off , in latitude 8 degrees 57 ' south and longitude 139 degrees 32 ' west , i spotted martin point on nuku hiva , chief member of this island group that belongs to france . i could make out only its wooded mountains on the horizon , because captain nemo hated to hug shore . there our nets brought up some fine fish samples : dolphinfish with azure fins , gold tails , and flesh that 's unrivaled in the entire world , wrasse from the genus hologymnosus that were nearly denuded of scales but exquisite in flavor , knifejaws with bony beaks , yellowish albacore that were as tasty as bonito , all fish worth classifying in the ship 's pantry .",109

"for some days we saw a large number of aquatic birds with webbed feet , known as gulls or sea mews . some were skillfully slain , and when cooked in a certain fashion , they make a very acceptable platter of water game . among the great wind riders -- carried over long distances from every shore and resting on the waves from their exhausting flights-- i spotted some magnificent albatross , birds belonging to the longipennes ( long - winged ) family , whose discordant calls sound like the braying of an ass . the totipalmes ( fully webbed ) family was represented by swift frigate birds , nimbly catching fish at the surface , and by numerous tropic birds of the genus phaeton , among others the red - tailed tropic bird , the size of a pigeon , its white plumage shaded with pink tints that contrasted with its dark - hued wings .",112
"i 'll mention chiefly some trunkfish unique to the red sea , the sea of the east indies , and that part of the ocean washing the coasts of equinoctial america . like turtles , armadillos , sea urchins , and crustaceans , these fish are protected by armor plate that 's neither chalky nor stony but actual bone . sometimes this armor takes the shape of a solid triangle , sometimes that of a solid quadrangle . among the triangular type , i noticed some half a decimeter long , with brown tails , yellow fins , and wholesome , exquisitely tasty flesh ; i even recommend that they be acclimatized to fresh water , a change , incidentally , that a number of saltwater fish can make with ease . i 'll also mention some quadrangular trunkfish topped by four large protuberances along the back ; trunkfish sprinkled with white spots on the underside of the body , which make good house pets like certain birds ; boxfish armed with stings formed by extensions of their bony crusts , and whose odd grunting has earned them the nickname "" sea pigs "" ; then some trunkfish known as dromedaries , with tough , leathery flesh and big conical humps .",126
