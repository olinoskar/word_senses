"the next day -- the 21st of december -- the colonists descended to the beach , and having climbed the plateau they found nothing of ayrton .",14,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
it was eight o'clock in the morning . we had four hours to ourselves before the sun could be productively observed . i guided our steps toward a huge bay that made a crescent - shaped incision in the granite cliffs along the beach .,43,"('beach', 'rivage', 'orillar')",1
"supper , this evening , was of course composed of the inevitable lithodomes , of which herbert and neb picked up a plentiful supply on the beach .",26,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
""" and make a waterfall , by falling on to the beach , "" added the reporter .",11,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"the next day , the 20th of october , at seven o'clock in the morning , after a voyage of four days , the "" bonadventure "" gently glided up to the beach at the mouth of the mercy .",32,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"there was no longer any doubt as to the pirates ' intentions . they had dropped anchor at a short distance from the island , and it was evident that the next day by means of their boats they purposed to land on the beach !",44,"('beach', 'rivage', 'playa')",2
"the waves rebounded in dazzling foam , the beach entirely disapppearing under the raging flood , and the cliff appearing to emerge from the sea itself , the spray rising to a height of more than a hundred feet .",8,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"at last , two minutes later , it reproached obliquely , and finally fell on a sandy beach , out of the reach of the waves .",17,"('beach', 'rivage', 'orillar')",1
"to arrive at the bottom of the well and then climb up to its mouth it was necessary to pass through the channel under the rocky subsoil of the beach , which placed it in communication with the sea , and this was only possible for marine animals .",29,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"but even this last retreat was now closed to them , and the lava - torrent , flowing over the edge of the granite wall , began to pour down upon the beach its cataracts of fire .",32,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"ayrton and pencroft , followed by their companions , descended to the beach .",12,"('beach', 'rivage', 'playa')",2
"breakfast over , harding and his companions left granite house and returned to the beach .",14,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"their companions were soon beside them , but could only ascertain one thing , that not only the islet but all the beach below granite house was covered with one uniform sheet of white .",22,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"now sandstone was abundant on the beach , and two hours after the stock of tools in the colony consisted of two sharp blades , which were easily fixed in solid handles .",6,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
there were plenty of shell - fish and eggs among the rocks and on the beach .,15,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"therefore , if this case was broken , the water would escape by the opening and form a stream , which , flowing over the inclined surface of the plateau , would rush on to the beach .",36,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
it was evident that the beach had been invaded by a number of animals which could not be seen .,5,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"at eight o'clock that evening the cart , after passing over the mercy bridge , descended the left bank of the river , and stopped on the beach .",27,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
a rapid stream of water rushed foaming across the plateau and dashed down a height of three hundred feet on to the beach !,22,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"in the midst of this moving vegetation , under arbors of water plants , there raced legions of clumsy articulates , in particular some fanged frog crabs whose carapaces form a slightly rounded triangle , robber crabs exclusive to these waterways , and horrible parthenope crabs whose appearance was repulsive to the eye . one animal no less hideous , which i encountered several times , was the enormous crab that mr . darwin observed , to which nature has given the instinct and requisite strength to eat coconuts ; it scrambles up trees on the beach and sends the coconuts tumbling ; they fracture in their fall and are opened by its powerful pincers . here , under these clear waves , this crab raced around with matchless agility , while green turtles from the species frequenting the malabar coast moved sluggishly among the crumbling rocks .",96,"('beach', 'rivage', 'orillar')",1
"the lift descended , and in a few moments all were united on the beach .",14,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"at this place the beach was covered with little mounds , concealing perfectly spherical turtles ' eggs , with white hard shells , the albumen of which does not coagulate as that of birds ' eggs .",4,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"when supper was finished , before sleeping , harding and his companions went to take the air on the beach .",19,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"several times , one or other of the settlers descended to the beach in the midst of ice which the waves heaped up at each tide , but they soon climbed up again to granite house , and it was not without pain and difficulty that their hands could hold to the rounds of the ladder .",12,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"they rushed out on to the beach , and , their guns shouldered , they stood ready to repel any attack .",6,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"no granite cliff , no rocks , not even a sandy beach .",11,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"this instrument finished , the engineer returned to the beach , but as it was necessary to take the height of the pole from above a clear horizon , that is , a sea horizon , and as claw cape hid the southern horizon , he was obliged to look for a more suitable station .",9,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"at last , towards half - past twelve , a boat , carrying two men , touched the beach .",18,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"instead of proceeding over the summit of a cliff or along a sandy beach , the settlers were obliged to remain under cover of the trees so that they might continue on the shore .",13,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"the creature understood , seized the cord , glided rapidly down the beach , and disappeared in the darkness without the convicts ' attention having been in the least excited .",12,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
the convicts had not appeared at all on the beach .,9,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"having reached a spot about twenty feet from the edge of the beach , and nearly five hundred feet from the cliff , which rose perpendicularly , harding thrust the pole two feet into the sand , and wedging it up carefully , he managed , by means of the plumb - line , to erect it perpendicularly with the plane of the horizon .",12,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"by then we were forced to go back down to the beach because the ridge had become impossible . above us , the yawning crater looked like the wide mouth of a well . from where we stood , the sky was pretty easy to see , and i watched clouds race by , disheveled by the west wind , letting tatters of mist trail over the mountain 's summit . proof positive that those clouds kept at a moderate altitude , because this volcano did n't rise more than 1,800 feet above the level of the ocean .",11,"('beach', 'rivage', 'orillar')",1
"half an hour after the canadian 's latest exploits , we were back on the inner beach . there the local flora was represented by a wide carpet of samphire , a small umbelliferous plant that keeps quite nicely , which also boasts the names glasswort , saxifrage , and sea fennel . conseil picked a couple bunches . as for the local fauna , it included thousands of crustaceans of every type : lobsters , hermit crabs , prawns , mysid shrimps , daddy longlegs , rock crabs , and a prodigious number of seashells , such as cowries , murex snails , and limpets .",16,"('beach', 'rivage', 'orillar')",1
"and as if these few words had been difficult to say , he retreated to the beach , where he walked up and down between the cascade and the mouth of the mercy , in a state of extreme agitation .",16,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"by six o'clock in the evening , we were back on the beach . the skiff was aground in its usual place . the nautilus , looking like a long reef , emerged from the waves two miles offshore .",12,"('beach', 'plage', 'playa')",3
"then the nautilus drew near the beaches of africa , where the sea is considerably deeper . there , through the open panels and in a midwater of crystal clarity , our ship enabled us to study wonderful bushes of shining coral and huge chunks of rock wrapped in splendid green furs of algae and fucus . what an indescribable sight , and what a variety of settings and scenery where these reefs and volcanic islands leveled off by the libyan coast ! but soon the nautilus hugged the eastern shore where these tree forms appeared in all their glory . this was off the coast of tihama , and there such zoophyte displays not only flourished below sea level but they also fashioned picturesque networks that unreeled as high as ten fathoms above it ; the latter were more whimsical but less colorful than the former , which kept their bloom thanks to the moist vitality of the waters .",6,"('beach', 'rivage', 'orillar')",1
"properly speaking , the sargasso sea covers every submerged part of atlantis . certain authors have even held that the many weeds strewn over this sea were torn loose from the prairies of that ancient continent . but it 's more likely that these grasses , algae , and fucus plants were carried off from the beaches of europe and america , then taken as far as this zone by the gulf stream . this is one of the reasons why christopher columbus assumed the existence of a new world . when the ships of that bold investigator arrived in the sargasso sea , they had great difficulty navigating in the midst of these weeds , which , much to their crews ' dismay , slowed them down to a halt ; and they wasted three long weeks crossing this sector .",56,"('beach', 'rivage', 'orillar')",1
"the beach was strewn with innumerable shells , some of which would have rejoiced the heart of a conchologist ; there were , among others , the phasianella , the terebratual , etc .",1,"('beach', 'rivage', 'orillar')",1
"he went to the beach , and as the pickaxe when it escaped from the hands of the reporter must have fallen perpendicularly to the foot of the cliff , the finding it would be sufficient to show the place where the hole had been pierced in the granite .",4,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
""" professor aronnax , "" replied captain nemo , whose fingers took their places again on the organ keys , "" if every islander in papua were to gather on that beach , the nautilus would still have nothing to fear from their attacks ! """,31,"('beach', 'plage', 'playa')",3
"i climbed onto the platform . night had already fallen , because in this low latitude the sun sets quickly , without any twilight . i could see gueboroa island only dimly . but numerous fires had been kindled on the beach , attesting that the natives had no thoughts of leaving it .",41,"('beach', 'plage', 'playa')",3
"now the beach supplied sand , lime supplied chalk , sea - weeds supplied soda , pyrites supplied sulphuric acid , and the ground supplied coal to heat the kiln to the wished - for temperature .",2,"('beach', 'rivage', 'playa')",2
"ayrton was waiting for them on the beach , and jup came joyously to meet them , giving vent to deep grunts of satisfaction .",7,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
from this point to claw cape the beach was very narrow between the edge of the forest and the reefs .,7,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"walking was now more difficult , on account of the numerous rocks which encumbered the beach .",15,"('beach', 'rivage', 'playa')",2
"towards the end of the month , herbert was already walking about on prospect heights , and the beach .",18,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"cyrus harding , the reporter , and herbert , after spending an hour on the plateau of prospect heights , again descended to the beach , and returned to granite house .",24,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"the dog then left the beach , and guided by his wonderful instinct , without showing the least hesitation , went straight in among the downs .",5,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"pencroft stayed the last in granite house in order to finish this work , and he then lowered himself down by means of a double rope held below , and which , when once hauled down , left no communication between the upper landing and the beach .",46,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"five minutes after having left the beach , the reporter and his two companions arrived at a sort of excavation , hollowed out at the back of a high mound .",6,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
the cart was waiting on the beach before the chimneys .,6,"('beach', 'rivage', 'orillar')",1
"however , for greater precaution , herbert took the trouble , which neb deemed superfluous , to wedge up the animal with great stones ; after which the two hunters returned to granite house , following the beach , which the tide had left uncovered .",37,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"the beach was easy to follow , and only in some places was their way barred by large rocks , which , however , they easily passed round .",1,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"and cyrus harding , hurrying away the reporter and ayrton , joined pencroft , neb , and herbert on the beach .",20,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"without having uttered a word , in a few moments they had left granite house , and were standing on the beach .",21,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"ayrton and pencroft were able to fasten the masts and spars by means of ropes , the ends of which were carried to the beach .",24,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"but what the colonists could not do for themselves chance did for them , and on the 3rd of may shouts from neb , who had stationed himself at the kitchen window , announced that the whale was stranded on the beach of the island .",41,"('beach', 'rivage', 'playa')",2
"the stranding had taken place on the beach of flotsam point , three miles from granite house , and at high tide .",7,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"they ran with pick - axes and iron - tipped poles in their hands , passed over the mercy bridge , descended the right bank of the river , along the beach , and in less than twenty minutes the settlers were close to the enormous animal , above which flocks of birds already hovered .",31,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"on the 11th we reached cape portland . the clear open weather gave us a good view of myrdals jokul , which overhangs it . the cape is merely a low hill with steep sides , standing lonely by the beach .",40,"('beach', 'plage', 'playa')",3
"the longest of the only two streets that rejkiavik possesses was parallel with the beach . here live the merchants and traders , in wooden cabins made of red planks set horizontally ; the other street , running west , ends at the little lake between the house of the bishop and other non - commercial people . i had soon explored these melancholy ways ; here and there i got a glimpse of faded turf , looking like a worn - out bit of carpet , or some appearance of a kitchen garden , the sparse vegetables of which ( potatoes , cabbages , and lettuces ) , would have figured appropriately upon a lilliputian table . a few sickly wallflowers were trying to enjoy the air and sunshine .",14,"('beach', 'rivage', 'playa')",2
""" what do i see down there on the beach ? """,9,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"as soon as the first gleam of light appeared in the east , the colonists , suitably armed , repaired to the beach under granite house .",22,"('beach', 'rivage', 'playa')",2
"two barrels were there , half buried in the sand , but still firmly attached to a large chest , which , sustained by them , had floated to the moment when it stranded on the beach .",36,"('beach', 'rivage', 'orillar')",1
"he would never consent to admit that in that channel , with its fine sandy bed , just like the beach , which he had often crossed at low water , there could be an unknown rock .",20,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
""" but , "" asked harding , in a still feeble voice , "" you did not , then , pick me up on the beach ? """,25,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
""" however , "" remarked pencroft , "" you must have been thrown on to the beach , and you must have had strength to walk here , since neb found your footmarks ! """,16,"('beach', 'rivage', 'playa')",2
"but happily his fears were not realized , and an hour and a half after they set out -- all that time had been taken up in going a distance of three miles -- the boat touched the beach below granite house .",38,"('beach', 'rivage', 'playa')",2
"all disappeared , except one who fell mortally wounded on the beach .",11,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"where harding 's engineering qualifications now came into play was in the construction of the machine for pressing the wool ; for he knew how to turn ingeniously to profit the mechanical force , hitherto unused , which the waterfall on the beach possessed to move a fulling - mill .",42,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"in fact , on the night of the 23rd , the hull entirely broke up , and some of the wreck was cast up on the beach .",26,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"however , the mystery which enveloped its strange destruction would doubtless never have been cleared away if , on the 30th of november , neb , strolling on the beach , had not found a piece of a thick iron cylinder , bearing traces of explosion .",29,"('beach', 'grève', 'playa')",0
"after having turned the point , the settlers saw a long beach washed by the open sea .",11,"('beach', 'plage', 'playa')",3
