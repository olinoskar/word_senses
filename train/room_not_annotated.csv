"speaking very slowly , he told him to tell the house - keeper that he wanted to see her , and then to go to the frame - maker and ask him to send two of his men round at once . it seemed to him that as the man left the room his eyes wandered in the direction of the screen . or was that merely his own fancy ?",52

"he had not entered the place for more than four years -- not , indeed , since he had used it first as a play- room when he was a child , and then as a study when he grew somewhat older . it was a large , well- proportioned room , which had been specially built by the last lord kelso for the use of the little grandson whom , for his strange likeness to his mother , and also for other reasons , he had always hated and desired to keep at a distance . it appeared to dorian to have but little changed . there was the huge italian cassone , with its fantastically painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings , in which he had so often hidden himself as a boy . there the satinwood book - case filled with his dog - eared schoolbooks . on the wall behind it was hanging the same ragged flemish tapestry where a faded king and queen were playing chess in a garden , while a company of hawkers rode by , carrying hooded birds on their gauntleted wrists . how well he remembered it all ! every moment of his lonely childhood came back to him as he looked round . he recalled the stainless purity of his boyish life , and it seemed horrible to him that it was here the fatal portrait was to be hidden away . how little he had thought , in those dead days , of all that was in store for him !",50

"then he turned his attention to embroideries and to the tapestries that performed the office of frescoes in the chill rooms of the northern nations of europe . as he investigated the subject-- and he always had an extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the moment in whatever he took up -- he was almost saddened by the reflection of the ruin that time brought on beautiful and wonderful things . he , at any rate , had escaped that . summer followed summer , and the yellow jonquils bloomed and died many times , and nights of horror repeated the story of their shame , but he was unchanged . no winter marred his face or stained his flowerlike bloom .",20

"why is it , dorian , that a man like the duke of berwick leaves the room of a club when you enter it ? why is it that so many gentlemen in london will neither go to your house or invite you to theirs ? you used to be a friend of lord staveley . i met him at dinner last week . your name happened to come up in conversation , in connection with the miniatures you have lent to the exhibition at the dudley . staveley curled his lip and said that you might have the most artistic tastes , but that you were a man whom no pure - minded girl should be allowed to know , and whom no chaste woman should sit in the same room with . i reminded him that i was a friend of yours , and asked him what he meant . he told me . he told me right out before everybody . it was horrible !",131

"the whole thing occurred in a moment — so quickly that i had no time to realize it . i have a vivid recollection of that instant , of holmes ' triumphant expression and the ring of his voice , of the cabman 's dazed , savage face , as he glared at the glittering handcuffs , which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists . for a second or two we might have been a group of statues . then , with an inarticulate roar of fury , the prisoner wrenched himself free from holmes 's grasp , and hurled himself through the window . woodwork and glass gave way before him ; but before he got quite through , gregson , lestrade , and holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds . he was dragged back into the room , and then commenced a terrific conflict . so powerful and so fierce was he , that the four of us were shaken off again and again . he appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit . his face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass , but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance . it was not until lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and half - strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail ; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his hands . that done , we rose to our feet breathless and panting .",143

"" she shall not be buried in that , "" he cried with a fierce snarl , and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone . so strange and so brief was the episode , that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it , had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared .",150

""" but john reed knocked me down , and my aunt shut me up in the red - room . """,18
"the ordinary sitting - room and bedrooms i left much as they were : for i knew diana and mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables , and chairs , and beds , than from the spectacle of the smartest innovations . still some novelty was necessary , to give to their return the piquancy with which i wished it to be invested .",4
"they were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms ; with the new drapery , and fresh carpets , and rich tinted china vases : they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly .",10
"bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast - room , and led the way out .",9
"as our mutual happiness ( _ i.e. _ , diana 's , mary 's , and mine ) settled into a quieter character , and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies , st . john stayed more at home : he sat with us in the same room , sometimes for hours together .",49
"from every enjoyment i was , of course , excluded : my share of the gaiety consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of eliza and georgiana , and seeing them descend to the drawing - room , dressed out in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes , with hair elaborately ringletted ; and afterwards , in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played below , to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman , to the jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed , to the broken hum of conversation as the drawing - room door opened and closed .",35

"from this window were visible the porter 's lodge and the carriage - road , and just as i had dissolved so much of the silver - white foliage veiling the panes as left room to look out , i saw the gates thrown open and a carriage roll through .",34
"she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change , but she felt that there was no time to be lost , as she was shrinking rapidly ; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit . her chin was pressed so closely against her foot , that there was hardly room to open her mouth ; but she did it at last , and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit .",59
"it was decided that the castaway , or rather the stranger as he was thenceforth termed by his companions , should live in one of the rooms of granite house , from which , however , he could not escape .",26
""" shall you come down to the drawing - room after dinner ? """,9
"he and i were the only occupants of the parlour : diana was practising her music in the drawing - room , mary was gardening -- it was a very fine may day , clear , sunny , and breezy .",20
and she made a sign for kitty to leave the room .,10
""" you shall go into the breakfast - room first , "" said bessie , as she preceded me through the hall ; "" the young ladies will be there . """,8
""" go out of the room ; return to the nursery , "" was her mandate .",5
"i got up , i went to the door ; i came back again ; i walked to the window , across the room , then close up to her .",23
"i confined myself then to begging him to give up his chamber , which is the handsomest in the hotel , and to be satisfied with a pretty little room on the third floor ; but to this monsieur porthos replied that as he every moment expected his mistress , who was one of the greatest ladies in the court , i might easily comprehend that the chamber he did me the honor to occupy in my house was itself very mean for the visit of such a personage .",29
"i opened the glass - door in the breakfast - room : the shrubbery was quite still : the black frost reigned , unbroken by sun or breeze , through the grounds .",10
""" indeed , sir , "" said milady , "" you must be either drunk or mad . leave the room , and send me a woman . """,20
"is the nurse here ? or is there no one in the room but you ? """,12
"distracted between these two passions he took his gold and his diamonds , and procured a person to conduct him and martin to the house where miss cunegund lodged . upon entering the room he felt his limbs tremble , his heart flutter , his tongue falter ; he attempted to undraw the curtain , and called for a light to the bedside .",33
"that night , after he had kissed his sisters , he thought proper to forget even to shake hands with me , but left the room in silence .",25
"in the midst of his transports came an officer into the room , followed by the abbe , and a file of musketeers .",11
at five o'clock dinner was served in the dining - room of granite house .,10
"then i thought of eliza and georgiana ; i beheld one the cynosure of a ball - room , the other the inmate of a convent cell ; and i dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities of person and character .",17
"i could not believe my own eyes ; but the heated air and the sensation of burning left me no room for doubt . we had come out of the crater half naked , and the radiant orb to which we had been strangers for two months was lavishing upon us out of his blazing splendours more of his light and heat than we were able to receive with comfort .",20
"when i again unclosed my eyes , a loud bell was ringing ; the girls were up and dressing ; day had not yet begun to dawn , and a rushlight or two burned in the room .",36
"a distant bell tinkled : immediately three ladies entered the room , each walked to a table and took her seat .",10
"at nightfall he did not return to the room assigned to him , but remained under some clump of trees , or when the weather was bad crouched in some cleft of the rocks .",8
"the refectory was a great , low - ceiled , gloomy room ; on two long tables smoked basins of something hot , which , however , to my dismay , sent forth an odour far from inviting .",11
"neb , who was near him , terrified , ran into the next room where his companions were watching .",13
""" pass , janet , "" said he , making room for me to cross the stile : "" go up home , and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend 's threshold . """,10
""" sire , your majesty may go when you please ; the ship is ready "" ; and so saying he left the room .",23
the one candle was dying out : the room was full of moonlight .,8
""" no mention of that local hunt , watson , "" said holmes with a mischievous smile , "" but a country doctor , as you very astutely observed . i think that i am fairly justified in my inferences . as to the adjectives , i said , if i remember right , amiable , unambitious , and absent - minded . it is my experience that it is only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials , only an unambitious one who abandons a london career for the country , and only an absent - minded one who leaves his stick and not his visiting - card after waiting an hour in your room . """,117
"although the young man was brave , as we know , he was terrified at that wild countenance , those terribly dilated pupils , those pale cheeks , and those bleeding lips . he recoiled to the other side of the room as he would have done from a serpent which was crawling toward him , and his sword coming in contact with his nervous hand , he drew it almost unconsciously from the scabbard .",41
"electric wires linked the pilothouse with the engine room , and from this cabin the captain could simultaneously signal heading and speed to his nautilus . he pressed a metal button and at once the propeller slowed down significantly .",8
""" i observed it as you entered the room , "" said holmes .",8
"his wife hearing the noise , flew from the next room , and seeing me stretched upon the table with my crucial incision , was still more terrified than her husband , and fell upon him .",10
and both again left the room .,5
"d’artagnan , in a state of fury , crossed the antechamber at three bounds , and was darting toward the stairs , which he reckoned upon descending four at a time , when , in his heedless course , he ran head foremost against a musketeer who was coming out of one of m. de treville ’s private rooms , and striking his shoulder violently , made him utter a cry , or rather a howl .",58
"these ladies were deferentially received by miss temple , as mrs . and the misses brocklehurst , and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the room .",28
"it seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend relative , and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room upstairs , while he transacted business with the housekeeper , questioned the laundress , and lectured the superintendent .",22
between the two talkers there was just enough room for a man to pass .,8
"immediately the door was forced rather than opened , and the colonists rushed into the room .",15
