"and yet it may seem a small matter in itself . you are aware that i am not a very sound sleeper , and since i have been on guard in this house my slumbers have been lighter than ever . last night , about two in the morning , i was aroused by a stealthy step passing my room . i rose , opened my door , and peeped out . a long black shadow was trailing down the corridor . it was thrown by a man who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in his hand . he was in shirt and trousers , with no covering to his feet . i could merely see the outline , but his height told me that it was barrymore . he walked very slowly and circumspectly , and there was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole appearance .",59

"speaking very slowly , he told him to tell the house - keeper that he wanted to see her , and then to go to the frame - maker and ask him to send two of his men round at once . it seemed to him that as the man left the room his eyes wandered in the direction of the screen . or was that merely his own fancy ?",52

"he had not entered the place for more than four years -- not , indeed , since he had used it first as a play- room when he was a child , and then as a study when he grew somewhat older . it was a large , well- proportioned room , which had been specially built by the last lord kelso for the use of the little grandson whom , for his strange likeness to his mother , and also for other reasons , he had always hated and desired to keep at a distance . it appeared to dorian to have but little changed . there was the huge italian cassone , with its fantastically painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings , in which he had so often hidden himself as a boy . there the satinwood book - case filled with his dog - eared schoolbooks . on the wall behind it was hanging the same ragged flemish tapestry where a faded king and queen were playing chess in a garden , while a company of hawkers rode by , carrying hooded birds on their gauntleted wrists . how well he remembered it all ! every moment of his lonely childhood came back to him as he looked round . he recalled the stainless purity of his boyish life , and it seemed horrible to him that it was here the fatal portrait was to be hidden away . how little he had thought , in those dead days , of all that was in store for him !",50

"often , on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were his friends , or thought that they were so , he himself would creep upstairs to the locked room , open the door with the key that never left him now , and stand , with a mirror , in front of the portrait that basil hallward had painted of him , looking now at the evil and aging face on the canvas , and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him from the polished glass . the very sharpness of the contrast used to quicken his sense of pleasure . he grew more and more enamoured of his own beauty , more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul . he would examine with minute care , and sometimes with a monstrous and terrible delight , the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth , wondering sometimes which were the more horrible , the signs of sin or the signs of age . he would place his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture , and smile . he mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs .",42

"my feelings towards him were very far from being friendly after what i had heard of his treatment of his daughter , but i was anxious to send perkins and the wagonette home , and the opportunity was a good one . i alighted and sent a message to sir henry that i should walk over in time for dinner . then i followed frankland into his dining - room .",69
"then he turned his attention to embroideries and to the tapestries that performed the office of frescoes in the chill rooms of the northern nations of europe . as he investigated the subject-- and he always had an extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the moment in whatever he took up -- he was almost saddened by the reflection of the ruin that time brought on beautiful and wonderful things . he , at any rate , had escaped that . summer followed summer , and the yellow jonquils bloomed and died many times , and nights of horror repeated the story of their shame , but he was unchanged . no winter marred his face or stained his flowerlike bloom .",20

"why is it , dorian , that a man like the duke of berwick leaves the room of a club when you enter it ? why is it that so many gentlemen in london will neither go to your house or invite you to theirs ? you used to be a friend of lord staveley . i met him at dinner last week . your name happened to come up in conversation , in connection with the miniatures you have lent to the exhibition at the dudley . staveley curled his lip and said that you might have the most artistic tastes , but that you were a man whom no pure - minded girl should be allowed to know , and whom no chaste woman should sit in the same room with . i reminded him that i was a friend of yours , and asked him what he meant . he told me . he told me right out before everybody . it was horrible !",131

"the whole thing occurred in a moment â€” so quickly that i had no time to realize it . i have a vivid recollection of that instant , of holmes ' triumphant expression and the ring of his voice , of the cabman 's dazed , savage face , as he glared at the glittering handcuffs , which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists . for a second or two we might have been a group of statues . then , with an inarticulate roar of fury , the prisoner wrenched himself free from holmes 's grasp , and hurled himself through the window . woodwork and glass gave way before him ; but before he got quite through , gregson , lestrade , and holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds . he was dragged back into the room , and then commenced a terrific conflict . so powerful and so fierce was he , that the four of us were shaken off again and again . he appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit . his face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass , but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance . it was not until lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and half - strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail ; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his hands . that done , we rose to our feet breathless and panting .",143

"the prediction of the mormon was only too well fulfilled . whether it was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which she had been forced , poor lucy never held up her head again , but pined away and died within a month . her sottish husband , who had married her principally for the sake of john ferrier 's property , did not affect any great grief at his bereavement ; but his other wives mourned over her , and sat up with her the night before the burial , as is the mormon custom . they were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning , when , to their inexpressible fear and astonishment , the door was flung open , and a savage - looking , weather - beaten man in tattered garments strode into the room . without a glance or a word to the cowering women , he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of lucy ferrier . stooping over her , he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead , and then , snatching up her hand , he took the wedding - ring from her finger . "" she shall not be buried in that , "" he cried with a fierce snarl , and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone . so strange and so brief was the episode , that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it , had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared .",150

"as our mutual happiness ( _ i.e. _ , diana 's , mary 's , and mine ) settled into a quieter character , and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies , st . john stayed more at home : he sat with us in the same room , sometimes for hours together .",49
"from every enjoyment i was , of course , excluded : my share of the gaiety consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of eliza and georgiana , and seeing them descend to the drawing - room , dressed out in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes , with hair elaborately ringletted ; and afterwards , in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played below , to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman , to the jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed , to the broken hum of conversation as the drawing - room door opened and closed .",35

"i could not believe my own eyes ; but the heated air and the sensation of burning left me no room for doubt . we had come out of the crater half naked , and the radiant orb to which we had been strangers for two months was lavishing upon us out of his blazing splendours more of his light and heat than we were able to receive with comfort .",20
