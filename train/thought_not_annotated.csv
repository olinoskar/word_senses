"as i mused in this way , trying to establish in my memory every detail of this impressive landscape , captain nemo was leaning his elbows on a moss - covered monument , motionless as if petrified in some mute trance . was he dreaming of those lost generations , asking them for the secret of human destiny ? was it here that this strange man came to revive himself , basking in historical memories , reliving that bygone life , he who had no desire for our modern one ? i would have given anything to know his thoughts , to share them , understand them !",99

"these wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the storm lasted , and indeed some time after ; but the next day the wind was abated , and the sea calmer , and i began to be a little inured to it ; however , i was very grave for all that day , being also a little sea - sick still ; but towards night the weather cleared up , the wind was quite over , and a charming fine evening followed ; the sun went down perfectly clear , and rose so the next morning ; and having little or no wind , and a smooth sea , the sun shining upon it , the sight was , as i thought , the most delightful that ever i saw .",4
"we were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship till we saw her sink , and then i understood for the first time what was meant by a ship foundering in the sea . i must acknowledge i had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told me she was sinking ; for from the moment that they rather put me into the boat than that i might be said to go in , my heart was , as it were , dead within me , partly with fright , partly with horror of mind , and the thoughts of what was yet before me .",105

"as to going home , shame opposed the best motions that offered to my thoughts , and it immediately occurred to me how i should be laughed at among the neighbours , and should be ashamed to see , not my father and mother only , but even everybody else ; from whence i have since often observed , how incongruous and irrational the common temper of mankind is , especially of youth , to that reason which ought to guide them in such cases — viz . that they are not ashamed to sin , and yet are ashamed to repent ; not ashamed of the action for which they ought justly to be esteemed fools , but are ashamed of the returning , which only can make them be esteemed wise men .",14
"this was the only voyage which i may say was successful in all my adventures , which i owe to the integrity and honesty of my friend the captain ; under whom also i got a competent knowledge of the mathematics and the rules of navigation , learned how to keep an account of the ship ’s course , take an observation , and , in short , to understand some things that were needful to be understood by a sailor ; for , as he took delight to instruct me , i took delight to learn ; and , in a word , this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant ; for i brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold - dust for my adventure , which yielded me in london , at my return , almost £ 300 ; and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts which have since so completed my ruin .",152
"after about two years , an odd circumstance presented itself , which put the old thought of making some attempt for my liberty again in my head . my patron lying at home longer than usual without fitting out his ship , which , as i heard , was for want of money , he used constantly , once or twice a week , sometimes oftener if the weather was fair , to take the ship ’s pinnace and go out into the road a - fishing ; and as he always took me and young maresco with him to row the boat , we made him very merry , and i proved very dexterous in catching fish ; insomuch that sometimes he would send me with a moor , one of his kinsmen , and the youth — the maresco , as they called him — to catch a dish of fish for him .",15
