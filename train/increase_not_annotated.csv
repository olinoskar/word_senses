""" lower down the density will still increase . """,7
""" with the increasing consumption of coal , "" replied gideon spilett , "" it can be foreseen that the hundred thousand workmen will soon become two hundred thousand , and that the rate of extraction will be doubled . """,3
"unfortunately , as he advanced , his anger increased at every step ; and instead of the proper and lofty speech he had prepared as a prelude to his challenge , he found nothing at the tip of his tongue but a gross personality , which he accompanied with a furious gesture .",8
""" what is the employment you had in view , mr . rivers ? i hope this delay will not have increased the difficulty of securing it . """,21
""" then , "" said the abbess , looking at milady with increasing interest , "" i behold another poor victim ? """,12
"the fog increased the darkness , and formed round the sternlights and lanterns of the jetty a circle like that which surrounds the moon when the weather threatens to become rainy .",2
suddenly i felt a mild jolt . i realized the nautilus had come to rest on the ocean floor . my alarm increased . the canadian 's signal had n't reached me . i longed to rejoin ned land and urge him to postpone his attempt . i sensed that we were no longer navigating under normal conditions .,22
"the thermometer marked -12 degrees centigrade , and a fresh breeze left a sharp nip in the air . ice floes were increasing over the open water . the sea was starting to congeal everywhere . numerous blackish patches were spreading over its surface , announcing the imminent formation of fresh ice . obviously this southernmost basin froze over during its six - month winter and became utterly inaccessible . what happened to the whales during this period ? no doubt they went beneath the ice bank to find more feasible seas . as for seals and walruses , they were accustomed to living in the harshest climates and stayed on in these icy waterways . these animals know by instinct how to gouge holes in the ice fields and keep them continually open ; they go to these holes to breathe . once the birds have migrated northward to escape the cold , these marine mammals remain as sole lords of the polar continent .",22
"the engineer had observed that it was increased by numerous affluents , but they were unnavigable , being simply little streams .",7
""" the common narwhale , or sea unicorn , often reaches a length of sixty feet . increase its dimensions fivefold or even tenfold , then give this cetacean a strength in proportion to its size while enlarging its offensive weapons , and you have the animal we 're looking for . it would have the proportions determined by the officers of the shannon , the instrument needed to perforate the scotia , and the power to pierce a steamer 's hull .",17
meanwhile the nautilus 's speed had increased appreciably . so it was gathering momentum . its entire hull was vibrating .,6
"i waited with the deepest anxiety . sound does not travel with great velocity . even increased density air has no effect upon its rate of travelling ; it merely augments its intensity . seconds , which seemed ages , passed away , and at last these words reached me :",16
"the ceiling lights were off , yet the lounge was still brightly lit . this was due to the reflecting power of the walls of ice , which threw the beams of our beacon right back at us . words can not describe the effects produced by our galvanic rays on these huge , whimsically sculpted blocks , whose every angle , ridge , and facet gave off a different glow depending on the nature of the veins running inside the ice . it was a dazzling mine of gems , in particular sapphires and emeralds , whose jets of blue and green crisscrossed . here and there , opaline hues of infinite subtlety raced among sparks of light that were like so many fiery diamonds , their brilliance more than any eye could stand . the power of our beacon was increased a hundredfold , like a lamp shining through the biconvex lenses of a world - class lighthouse .",142
"as to pelicans , kingfishers , water - hens , they came of themselves to the shores of the poultry - yard , and this little community , after some disputes , cooing , screaming , clucking , ended by settling down peacefully , and increased in encouraging proportion for the future use of the colony .",45
"such as it was , it did us good service . the steepness increased , but these stone steps allowed us to rise with facility , and even with such rapidity that , having rested for a moment while my companions continued their ascent , i perceived them already reduced by distance to microscopic dimensions .",13
""" everything you say , captain , just increases my curiosity . i 'm ready to go with you . """,8
"the different streams which flowed into it increased it to a regular river further down , but here it was simply a shallow , limpid brook .",7
"as we moved forward , i heard a kind of pitter - patter above my head . sometimes this noise increased and became a continuous crackle . i soon realized the cause . it was a heavy rainfall rattling on the surface of the waves . instinctively i worried that i might get soaked ! by water in the midst of water ! i could n't help smiling at this outlandish notion . but to tell the truth , wearing these heavy diving suits , you no longer feel the liquid element , you simply think you 're in the midst of air a little denser than air on land , that 's all .",20
"evidently the island , with its water , its harbor , its resources of all kinds so increased in value by the colonists , and the concealment afforded by granite house , could not but be convenient for the convicts ; in their hands it would become an excellent place of refuge , and , being unknown , it would assure them , for a long time perhaps , impunity and security .",17
"the first attempts were somewhat crude , but in consequence of the cleverness and intelligence of the workmen , by consulting , and recalling the models which they had seen , and by emulating each other , the possessions of the colony were soon increased by several baskets of different sizes .",44
"these stones , when decomposed by heat , made a very strong quicklime , greatly increased by slacking , at least as pure as if it had been produced by the calcination of chalk or marble .",15
"this was a misfortune . mr . fogg , in order not to deviate from his course , furled his sails and increased the force of the steam ; but the vessel 's speed slackened , owing to the state of the sea , the long waves of which broke against the stern . she pitched violently , and this retarded her progress . the breeze little by little swelled into a tempest , and it was to be feared that the henrietta might not be able to maintain herself upright on the waves .",22
"on arriving at the end of one of these gloomy caverns , extending several hundred feet into the interior of the mountain , he was surprised to hear a deep rumbling noise , increased in intensity by the sonorousness of the rocks .",33
"there the obsessive fears in my brain left me . i became surprisingly calm again . the ease with which i could move increased my confidence , and the many strange sights captivated my imagination .",23
"contrary to what might have been supposed , the diameter of the passage increased as the explorers proceeded , so that they very soon were able to stand upright .",13
""" yes . "" the queen ’s paleness , if possible , increased ; the king perceived it , and enjoyed it with that cold cruelty which was one of the worst sides of his character .",12
there can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition — for why should i not so term it?—served mainly to accelerate the increase itself .,11

"there lay a mystery , but i did n't insist on exploring it . how could electricity work with such power ? where did this nearly unlimited energy originate ? was it in the extraordinary voltage obtained from some new kind of induction coil ? could its transmission have been immeasurably increased by some unknown system of levers ? this was the point i could n't grasp .",51
"just then i was in the bow , leaning over the starboard rail . conseil , stationed beside me , stared straight ahead . roosting in the shrouds , the crew examined the horizon , which shrank and darkened little by little . officers were probing the increasing gloom with their night glasses . sometimes the murky ocean sparkled beneath moonbeams that darted between the fringes of two clouds . then all traces of light vanished into the darkness .",47
"towards morning the ascending movement became accelerated . if the heat increased , instead of diminishing , as we approached nearer to the surface of the globe , this effect was due to local causes alone , and those volcanic . the manner of our locomotion left no doubt in my mind . an enormous force , a force of hundreds of atmospheres , generated by the extreme pressure of confined vapours , was driving us irresistibly forward . but to what numberless dangers it exposed us !",11
"the stopcocks of the ballast tanks were then opened wide , and 100 cubic meters of water rushed in , increasing the nautilus 's weight by 100,000 kilograms .",20
""" but athos ! "" cried d’artagnan , whose impatience was increased by the disregard of the authorities , "" athos , where is he ? """,11
"they therefore waited with some impatience , when an incident occurred which increased the desire the settlers had to visit the whole of their domain .",12
"the corral was enlarged , for the flock of musmons and goats had been increased by a number of young ones , who had to be housed and fed .",14
""" but , "" i said , "" is there not reason to fear that this ever - increasing pressure will become at last very painful to bear ? """,18
"there were moments , indeed , at night , when , lying sleepless in his own delicately scented chamber , or in the sordid room of the little ill - famed tavern near the docks which , under an assumed name and in disguise , it was his habit to frequent , he would think of the ruin he had brought upon his soul with a pity that was all the more poignant because it was purely selfish . but moments such as these were rare . that curiosity about life which lord henry had first stirred in him , as they sat together in the garden of their friend , seemed to increase with gratification . the more he knew , the more he desired to know . he had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them .",113
"yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many his strange and dangerous charm . his great wealth was a certain element of security . society -- civilized society , at least-- is never very ready to believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and fascinating . it feels instinctively that manners are of more importance than morals , and , in its opinion , the highest respectability is of much less value than the possession of a good chef . and , after all , it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has given one a bad dinner , or poor wine , is irreproachable in his private life . even the cardinal virtues can not atone for half - cold entrées , as lord henry remarked once , in a discussion on the subject , and there is possibly a good deal to be said for his view . for the canons of good society are , or should be , the same as the canons of art . form is absolutely essential to it . it should have the dignity of a ceremony , as well as its unreality , and should combine the insincere character of a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us . is insincerity such a terrible thing ? i think not . it is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities .",5
"the wonder was increased , though the doubt continued to exist .",3
"this was perfectly true . when the ten minutes were over we started off again with renewed and increased speed . we were obliged to lay fast hold of the planks of the raft , not to be thrown off . then again the paroxysm was over .",18
"the wind rose , and from a fresh breeze it soon increased to a regular gale ; that is to say , it acquired a speed of from forty to forty - five miles an hour , before which a ship in the open sea would have run under close - reefed topsails .",11
"his melancholy increased , and martin never ceased trying to prove to him that there is very little virtue or happiness in this world ; except , perhaps , in el dorado , where hardly anybody can gain admittance .",2
""" in the second place , because oxygen is the basis of life , and we know that the amount of oxygen dissolved in salt water increases rather than decreases with depth , that the pressure in these lower strata helps to concentrate their oxygen content . """,26
"in the corral , the flock of musmons had also increased , and several lambs already bleated in the sheds , to the great delight of neb and herbert , who had each their favorite among these newcomers .",10
"they could not see the sun , then hid by the vast screen of the upper cone , which masked the half - horizon of the west , and whose enormous shadow stretching to the shore increased as the radiant luminary sank in its diurnal course .",36
"the cardinal was , as we have said , in very low spirits ; and nothing when he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as gaiety in others .",24
"the transparency of salt water has long been recognized . its clarity is believed to exceed that of spring water . the mineral and organic substances it holds in suspension actually increase its translucency . in certain parts of the caribbean sea , you can see the sandy bottom with startling distinctness as deep as 145 meters down , and the penetrating power of the sun 's rays seems to give out only at a depth of 300 meters . but in this fluid setting traveled by the nautilus , our electric glow was being generated in the very heart of the waves . it was no longer illuminated water , it was liquid light .",31
"my parents obliged me , at the age of fifteen , to put on this detestable habit only to increase the fortune of an elder brother of mine , whom god confound ! jealousy , discord , and fury , reside in our monastery .",19
"the opening among the stones and grass was then increased , thus producing a strong fall at the bottom of the passage , the overflow from which escaped by the inner well .",9
""" and do you know , "" i added , "" what happened since man has almost completely wiped out these beneficial races ? rotting weeds have poisoned the air , and this poisoned air causes the yellow fever that devastates these wonderful countries . this toxic vegetation has increased beneath the seas of the torrid zone , so the disease spreads unchecked from the mouth of the rio de la plata to florida ! """,49
"the same day an odd fishing practice further increased the nautilus 's stores , so full of game were these seas . our trawl brought up in its meshes a number of fish whose heads were topped by little oval slabs with fleshy edges . these were suckerfish from the third family of the subbrachian malacopterygia . these flat disks on their heads consist of crosswise plates of movable cartilage , between which the animals can create a vacuum , enabling them to stick to objects like suction cups .",8
"harding took all this in at a glance , and without hesitating , followed by the lad , he entered the enormous chasm in the midst of an increasing obscurity .",28
"as the esculents increased in number , it became necessary to enlarge the simple beds , which threatened to grow into regular fields and replace the meadows .",3
""" i do n't know — not very long . "" the man 's eyes were fixed upon the northern horizon . in the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared three little specks which increased in size every moment , so rapidly did they approach . they speedily resolved themselves into three large brown birds , which circled over the heads of the two wanderers , and then settled upon some rocks which overlooked them . they were buzzards , the vultures of the west , whose coming is the forerunner of death .",36
"i see trees laden with ripening fruit . i hear a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off ; no moving form is visible , no coming step audible ; but that perfume increases : i must flee .",35
"the radius of this circular portion of the sky , framed by the edge of the cone , increased obviously .",18
"meanwhile as the sun slowly advanced , the shadow slowly diminished , and when it appeared to cyrus harding that it was beginning to increase , he asked , "" what o'clock is it ? "" "" one minute past five , "" replied gideon spilett directly .",24
"but what was clearest in all this was that the true hatred , the profound hatred , the inveterate hatred of milady , was increased by his not having killed her brother - in - law .",24
"from that day the smoke never disappeared from the top of the mountain , and it could even be perceived that it increased in height and thickness , without any flame mingling in its heavy volumes .",22
""" you must have something to do with it . wait , wait a moment ; listen to me . only listen , alan . all i ask of you is to perform a certain scientific experiment . you go to hospitals and dead - houses , and the horrors that you do there do n't affect you . if in some hideous dissecting - room or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it for the blood to flow through , you would simply look upon him as an admirable subject . you would not turn a hair . you would not believe that you were doing anything wrong . on the contrary , you would probably feel that you were benefiting the human race , or increasing the sum of knowledge in the world , or gratifying intellectual curiosity , or something of that kind .",138
"it was , beyond doubt , the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention ; for , amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements , and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm , the sound , in itself , had nothing , surely , which should have interested or disturbed me .",35
"at any rate , some leagues to the windward there must be some noisy phenomenon , for now the roarings are heard with increasing loudness . do they proceed from the sky or the ocean ?",23
"the suppuration was established in a regular way , the fever did not increase , and it might now be hoped that this terrible wound would not involve any catastrophe .",13
""" meantime , night came on rapidly , and with night my terrors increased . i did not know but i had better remain where i was seated . it appeared that i was surrounded with unknown dangers into which i was about to fall at every instant .",13
"d’artagnan bowed without replying , feeling his desire to don the musketeer ’s uniform vastly increased by the great difficulties which preceded the attainment of it .",15
"doubtless some whaler had landed them on the island , where they had rapidly increased .",14
"as fast as we descended , the succession of beds forming the primitive foundation came out with increasing distinctness . geologists consider this primitive matter to be the base of the mineral crust of the earth , and have ascertained it to be composed of three different formations , schist , gneiss , and mica schist , resting upon that unchangeable foundation , the granite .",17
"during the lecture the train had been making good progress , and towards half - past twelve it reached the northwest border of the great salt lake . thence the passengers could observe the vast extent of this interior sea , which is also called the dead sea , and into which flows an american jordan . it is a picturesque expanse , framed in lofty crags in large strata , encrusted with white salt -- a superb sheet of water , which was formerly of larger extent than now , its shores having encroached with the lapse of time , and thus at once reduced its breadth and increased its depth .",109
""" my son , do n't say such dreadful things , "" murmured mrs . vane , taking up a tawdry theatrical dress , with a sigh , and beginning to patch it . she felt a little disappointed that he had not joined the group . it would have increased the theatrical picturesqueness of the situation .",50

"but this mystery would inevitably be cleared up , and soon , because captain nemo gave orders to increase speed ; at once the engine stepped up its drive power , setting the propeller in swifter rotation .",18
"but when i had done this , i was unable to stir it up again , or to get under it , much less to move it forward towards the water ; so i was forced to give it over ; and yet , though i gave over the hopes of the boat , my desire to venture over for the main increased , rather than decreased , as the means for it seemed impossible .",62
"in fact , a ship is like a little world in miniature , and the stores of the colony would be increased by a large number of useful articles .",21
"in fact , if the brig was still fit to navigate , the colonists ' chances of returning to their native land were singularly increased .",24
"the old rajah 's body , indeed , now appeared upon the burning pyre ; and the priests , recovered from their terror , perceived that an abduction had taken place . they hastened into the forest , followed by the soldiers , who fired a volley after the fugitives ; but the latter rapidly increased the distance between them , and ere long found themselves beyond the reach of the bullets and arrows .",55
"we hurried forward in the greatest excitement . i was no longer sensible of my fatigue . this murmuring of waters close at hand was already refreshing me . it was audibly increasing . the torrent , after having for some time flowed over our heads , was now running within the left wall , roaring and rushing . frequently i touched the wall , hoping to feel some indications of moisture : but there was no hope here .",32
at ten in the morning the symptoms of storm become aggravated . the wind never lulls but to acquire increased strength ; the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts and rushing storms .,19
"this point , of which the distance was increased by the irregularity of the coast , was nearly three miles from the mercy .",8
"they dragged with them a sort of rough cart , which replaced the former inconvenient hurdle , and brought back some thousands of oysters , which soon increased among the rocks and formed a bed at the mouth of the mercy .",27
"the cavalier made a movement as if to follow the carriage ; but d’artagnan , whose anger , already excited , was much increased by recognizing in him the englishman of amiens who had won his horse and had been very near winning his diamond of athos , caught at his bridle and stopped him .",23
the heat increases . i refer to the thermometer ; it indicates . . . ( the figure is obliterated ) .,2
"secondly , there was the account of four years more , while they kept the effects in their hands , before the government claimed the administration , as being the effects of a person not to be found , which they called civil death ; and the balance of this , the value of the plantation increasing , amounted to nineteen thousand four hundred and forty - six crusadoes , being about three thousand two hundred and forty moidores .",56
"this felt could then be obtained by a simple operation which , if it diminished the flexibility of the stuff , increased its power of retaining heat in proportion .",21
"while he took his sights with his sextant , one of the nautilus 's sailors-- that muscular man who had gone with us to crespo island during our first underwater excursion -- came up to clean the glass panes of the beacon . i then examined the fittings of this mechanism , whose power was increased a hundredfold by biconvex lenses that were designed like those in a lighthouse and kept its rays productively focused . this electric lamp was so constructed as to yield its maximum illuminating power . in essence , its light was generated in a vacuum , insuring both its steadiness and intensity . such a vacuum also reduced wear on the graphite points between which the luminous arc expanded . this was an important savings for captain nemo , who could n't easily renew them . but under these conditions , wear and tear were almost nonexistent .",55

"many citizens , seeing the women flying toward the high street , leaving their children crying at the open doors , hastened to don the cuirass , and supporting their somewhat uncertain courage with a musket or a partisan , directed their steps toward the hostelry of the jolly miller , before which was gathered , increasing every minute , a compact group , vociferous and full of curiosity .",56
"i confess that i was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the practical nature of my companion 's theories . my respect for his powers of analysis increased wondrously . there still remained some lurking suspicion in my mind , however , that the whole thing was a pre - arranged episode , intended to dazzle me , though what earthly object he could have in taking me in was past my comprehension . when i looked at him he had finished reading the note , and his eyes had assumed the vacant , lack - lustre expression which showed mental abstraction .",28
