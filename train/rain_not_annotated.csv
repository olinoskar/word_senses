"no weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions : rain or fair , he would , when his hours of morning study were over , take his hat , and , followed by his father 's old pointer , carlo , go out on his mission of love or duty -- i scarcely know in which light he regarded it .",11

"october 16th.--a dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain . the house is banked in with rolling clouds , which rise now and then to show the dreary curves of the moor , with thin , silver veins upon the sides of the hills , and the distant boulders gleaming where the light strikes upon their wet faces . it is melancholy outside and in . the baronet is in a black reaction after the excitements of the night . i am conscious myself of a weight at my heart and a feeling of impending danger -- ever present danger , which is the more terrible because i am unable to define it .",10

""" in africa ! "" repeated passepartout . "" just think , monsieur , i had no idea that we should go farther than paris ; and all that i saw of paris was between twenty minutes past seven and twenty minutes before nine in the morning , between the northern and the lyons stations , through the windows of a car , and in a driving rain ! how i regret not having seen once more pere la chaise and the circus in the champs elysees !

"the storm of rain and wind descended upon them towards eight o'clock . with but its bit of sail , the tankadere was lifted like a feather by a wind , an idea of whose violence can scarcely be given . to compare her speed to four times that of a locomotive going on full steam would be below the truth .",3
"the red sea : that great lake so famous in biblical traditions , seldom replenished by rains , fed by no important rivers , continually drained by a high rate of evaporation , its water level dropping a meter and a half every year ! if it were fully landlocked like a lake , this odd gulf might dry up completely ; on this score it 's inferior to its neighbors , the caspian sea and the dead sea , whose levels lower only to the point where their evaporation exactly equals the amounts of water they take to their hearts .",16

"all the rest of the day i spent in afflicting myself at the dismal circumstances i was brought to — viz . i had neither food , house , clothes , weapon , nor place to fly to ; and in despair of any relief , saw nothing but death before me — either that i should be devoured by wild beasts , murdered by savages , or starved to death for want of food . at the approach of night i slept in a tree , for fear of wild creatures ; but slept soundly , though it rained all night .",99
"_ from the 1st of october to the 24th_.—all these days entirely spent in many several voyages to get all i could out of the ship , which i brought on shore every tide of flood upon rafts . much rain also in the days , though with some intervals of fair weather ; but it seems this was the rainy season .",40
"_ oct . _ 25.—it rained all night and all day , with some gusts of wind ; during which time the ship broke in pieces , the wind blowing a little harder than before , and was no more to be seen , except the wreck of her , and that only at low water . i spent this day in covering and securing the goods which i had saved , that the rain might not spoil them .",5

"all this time i worked very hard , the rains hindering me many days , nay , sometimes weeks together ; but i thought i should never be perfectly secure till this wall was finished ; and it is scarce credible what inexpressible labour everything was done with , especially the bringing piles out of the woods and driving them into the ground ; for i made them much bigger than i needed to have done .",9
"from the 14th of august to the 26th , incessant rain , so that i could not stir , and was now very careful not to be much wet . in this confinement , i began to be straitened for food : but venturing out twice , i one day killed a goat ; and the last day , which was the 26th , found a very large tortoise , which was a treat to me , and my food was regulated thus : i ate a bunch of raisins for my breakfast ; a piece of the goat ’s flesh , or of the turtle , for my dinner , broiled — for , to my great misfortune , i had no vessel to boil or stew anything ; and two or three of the turtle ’s eggs for my supper .",10
""" that is the great grimpen mire , "" said he . "" a false step yonder means death to man or beast . only yesterday i saw one of the moor ponies wander into it . he never came out . i saw his head for quite a long time craning out of the bog - hole , but it sucked him down at last . even in dry seasons it is a danger to cross it , but after these autumn rains it is an awful place . and yet i can find my way to the very heart of it and return alive . by george , there is another of those miserable ponies !

"dorian gray hurried along the quay through the drizzling rain . his meeting with adrian singleton had strangely moved him , and he wondered if the ruin of that young life was really to be laid at his door , as basil hallward had said to him with such infamy of insult . he bit his lip , and for a few seconds his eyes grew sad . yet , after all , what did it matter to him ? one 's days were too brief to take the burden of another 's errors on one 's shoulders . each man lived his own life and paid his own price for living it . the only pity was one had to pay so often for a single fault . one had to pay over and over again , indeed . in her dealings with man , destiny never closed her accounts .",9
