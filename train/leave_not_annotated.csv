"as for captain nemo , i wondered what he would make of our escaping , what concern or perhaps what distress it might cause him , and what he would do in the twofold event of our attempt either failing or being found out ! certainly i had no complaints to register with him , on the contrary . never was hospitality more wholehearted than his . yet in leaving him i could n't be accused of ingratitude . no solemn promises bound us to him . in order to keep us captive , he had counted only on the force of circumstances and not on our word of honor . but his avowed intention to imprison us forever on his ship justified our every effort .",69

"off the falkland islands on june 30 , the frigate came in contact with a fleet of american whalers , and we learned that they had n't seen the narwhale . but one of them , the captain of the monroe , knew that ned land had shipped aboard the abraham lincoln and asked his help in hunting a baleen whale that was in sight . anxious to see ned land at work , commander farragut authorized him to make his way aboard the monroe . and the canadian had such good luck that with a right - and - left shot , he harpooned not one whale but two , striking the first straight to the heart and catching the other after a few minutes ' chase !",100

"and this reaction was n't long in coming . for three months , during which each day seemed like a century , the abraham lincoln plowed all the northerly seas of the pacific , racing after whales sighted , abruptly veering off course , swerving sharply from one tack to another , stopping suddenly , putting on steam and reversing engines in quick succession , at the risk of stripping its gears , and it did n't leave a single point unexplored from the beaches of japan to the coasts of america . and we found nothing ! nothing except an immenseness of deserted waves ! nothing remotely resembling a gigantic narwhale , or an underwater islet , or a derelict shipwreck , or a runaway reef , or anything the least bit unearthly !",77
"but when we had ascended to an elevation of about 250 feet , we were stopped by insurmountable obstacles . the converging inside walls changed into overhangs , and our climb into a circular stroll . at this topmost level the vegetable kingdom began to challenge the mineral kingdom . shrubs , and even a few trees , emerged from crevices in the walls . i recognized some spurges that let their caustic , purgative sap trickle out . there were heliotropes , very remiss at living up to their sun - worshipping reputations since no sunlight ever reached them ; their clusters of flowers drooped sadly , their colors and scents were faded . here and there chrysanthemums sprouted timidly at the feet of aloes with long , sad , sickly leaves . but between these lava flows i spotted little violets that still gave off a subtle fragrance , and i confess that i inhaled it with delight . the soul of a flower is its scent , and those splendid water plants , flowers of the sea , have no souls !",132
"so that was the story of dorian gray 's parentage . crudely as it had been told to him , it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of a strange , almost modern romance . a beautiful woman risking everything for a mad passion . a few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a hideous , treacherous crime . months of voiceless agony , and then a child born in pain . the mother snatched away by death , the boy left to solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man .",83
"two days passed . the abraham lincoln stayed at half steam . on the offchance that the animal might be found in these waterways , a thousand methods were used to spark its interest or rouse it from its apathy . enormous sides of bacon were trailed in our wake , to the great satisfaction , i must say , of assorted sharks . while the abraham lincoln heaved to , its longboats radiated in every direction around it and did n't leave a single point of the sea unexplored . but the evening of november 4 arrived with this underwater mystery still unsolved .",82
