what love has she for me ?,1
"you -- you strange , you almost unearthly thing!--i love as my own flesh . you -- poor and obscure , and small and plain as you are -- i entreat to accept me as a husband . """,9
"and if i had loved him less i should have thought his accent and look of exultation savage ; but , sitting by him , roused from the nightmare of parting -- called to the paradise of union -- i thought only of the bliss given me to drink in so abundant a flow .",4
he thought his love slept sweetly : he finds she is stone dead .,3
""" but i feel this , helen ; i must dislike those who , whatever i do to please them , persist in disliking me ; i must resist those who punish me unjustly . it is as natural as that i should love those who show me affection , or submit to punishment when i feel it is deserved . """,43
""" love your enemies ; bless them that curse you ; do good to them that hate you and despitefully use you . """,1
""" i 'm coming to that , ma'am -- that mr . edward fell in love with .",15
""" distasteful ! and like you again ! i think i shall like you again , and yet again : and i will make you confess i do not only _ like _ , but _ love _ you -- with truth , fervour , constancy . """,36
"i never saw her myself ; but i 've heard leah , the house - maid , tell of her . leah liked her well enough . mr . rochester was about forty , and this governess not twenty ; and you see , when gentlemen of his age fall in love with girls , they are often like as if they were bewitched .",51
""" had you ever experience of such a character , sir ? did you ever love such an one ? """,15
""" i love it now . """,2
""" well , i feigned courtship of miss ingram , because i wished to render you as madly in love with me as i was with you ; and i knew jealousy would be the best ally i could call in for the furtherance of that end . """,19
i loved him very much -- more than i could trust myself to say -- more than words had power to express .,1
""" my dear little love ! in my country the ladies do without chambermaids . but stop !",4
""" oh , i ca n't explain . when i like people immensely , i never tell their names to any one . it is like surrendering a part of them . i have grown to love secrecy . it seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to us . the commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it . when i leave town now i never tell my people where i am going . if i did , i would lose all my pleasure . it is a silly habit , i dare say , but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into one 's life . i suppose you think me awfully foolish about it ?

""" monsieur chevalier , far off or near , "" said kitty , "" i shall always love you . """,17
""" and i , also , "" said d’artagnan , "" i also . i shall always love you ; be sure of that .",17
