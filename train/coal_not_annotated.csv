"the mongolia had still sixteen hundred and fifty miles to traverse before reaching bombay , and was obliged to remain four hours at steamer point to coal up . but this delay , as it was foreseen , did not affect phileas fogg 's programme ; besides , the mongolia , instead of reaching aden on the morning of the 15th , when she was due , arrived there on the evening of the 14th , a gain of fifteen hours .",26

"violent squalls assaulted us during the daytime . thanks to certain heavy mists , we could n't see from one end of the platform to the other . the wind shifted abruptly to every point on the compass . the snow was piling up in such packed layers , it had to be chipped loose with blows from picks . even in a temperature of merely -5 degrees centigrade , every outside part of the nautilus was covered with ice . a ship 's rigging would have been unusable , because all its tackle would have jammed in the grooves of the pulleys . only a craft without sails , driven by an electric motor that needed no coal , could face such high latitudes .",118
"the son , who had been his father 's secretary , had resigned along with his chief , somewhat foolishly as was thought at the time , and on succeeding some months later to the title , had set himself to the serious study of the great aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing . he had two large town houses , but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble , and took most of his meals at his club . he paid some attention to the management of his collieries in the midland counties , excusing himself for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of burning wood on his own hearth .",114

"the vessel was two miles off . it drew nearer , always moving toward the phosphorescent glow that signaled the nautilus 's presence . i saw its green and red running lights , plus the white lantern hanging from the large stay of its foremast . hazy flickerings were reflected on its rigging and indicated that its furnaces were pushed to the limit . showers of sparks and cinders of flaming coal escaped from its funnels , spangling the air with stars .",71

"dorian started and peered round . "" this will do , "" he answered , and having got out hastily and given the driver the extra fare he had promised him , he walked quickly in the direction of the quay . here and there a lantern gleamed at the stern of some huge merchantman . the light shook and splintered in the puddles . a red glare came from an outward - bound steamer that was coaling . the slimy pavement looked like a wet mackintosh .",77

"but the subterranean vegetation was not confined to these fungi . farther on rose groups of tall trees of colourless foliage and easy to recognise . they were lowly shrubs of earth , here attaining gigantic size ; lycopodiums , a hundred feet high ; the huge sigillaria , found in our coal mines ; tree ferns , as tall as our fir - trees in northern latitudes ; lepidodendra , with cylindrical forked stems , terminated by long leaves , and bristling with rough hairs like those of the cactus .",52
