"extending over an expanse of 100 leagues north to south , and over 90 leagues east to west , this island group lies between latitude 2 degrees and 6 degrees south , and between longitude 174 degrees and 179 degrees west . it consists of a number of islands , islets , and reefs , among which we noted the islands of viti levu , vanua levu , and kadavu .",58
"i went looking in the library for a book about this island , one of the most fertile in the world . sure enough , i found a volume entitled ceylon and the singhalese by h. c. sirr , esq . reentering the lounge , i first noted the bearings of ceylon , on which antiquity lavished so many different names . it was located between latitude 5 degrees 55 ' and 9 degrees 49 ' north , and between longitude 79 degrees 42 ' and 82 degrees 4 ' east of the meridian of greenwich ; its length is 275 miles ; its maximum width , 150 miles ; its circumference , 900 miles ; its surface area , 24,448 square miles , in other words , a little smaller than that of ireland .",47
"he placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed with a ring , and gave the billet to kitty .",10
""" on that note , professor , "" captain nemo told me , "" you and your companions will visit the mannar oysterbank , and if by chance some eager fisherman arrives early , well , we can watch him at work . """,3
"so captain dumont d'urville had put to sea in command of a vessel named after the astrolabe , and just two months after dillon had left vanikoro , dumont d'urville dropped anchor before hobart . there he heard about dillon 's findings , and he further learned that a certain james hobbs , chief officer on the union out of calcutta , had put to shore on an island located in latitude 8 degrees 18 ' south and longitude 156 degrees 30 ' east , and had noted the natives of those waterways making use of iron bars and red fabrics .",87
"i also noted long , whitish strings of salps , a type of mollusk found in clusters , and some jellyfish of large size that swayed in the eddies of the billows .",2
"lestrade glanced at his note - book . "" john rance , "" he said . "" he is off duty now . you will find him at 46 , audley court , kennington park gate . """,4
holmes took a note of the address .,3
"i would have been deeply interested in visiting this long , 360-league reef , against which the ever - surging sea broke with the fearsome intensity of thunderclaps . but just then the nautilus 's slanting fins took us to great depths , and i could see nothing of those high coral walls . i had to rest content with the various specimens of fish brought up by our nets . among others i noted some long - finned albacore , a species in the genus scomber , as big as tuna , bluish on the flanks , and streaked with crosswise stripes that disappear when the animal dies . these fish followed us in schools and supplied our table with very dainty flesh . we also caught a large number of yellow - green gilthead , half a decimeter long and tasting like dorado , plus some flying gurnards , authentic underwater swallows that , on dark nights , alternately streak air and water with their phosphorescent glimmers . among mollusks and zoophytes , i found in our trawl 's meshes various species of alcyonarian coral , sea urchins , hammer shells , spurred - star shells , wentletrap snails , horn shells , glass snails . the local flora was represented by fine floating algae : sea tangle , and kelp from the genus macrocystis , saturated with the mucilage their pores perspire , from which i selected a wonderful nemastoma geliniaroidea , classifying it with the natural curiosities in the museum .",74
""" note it then , my dear spilett ; for it appears proved that the presence of the eucalyptus is enough to neutralize miasmas .",1
"he also had been in all the battles , in the first rank , revolver in one hand , note - book in the other ; grape - shot never made his pencil tremble .",19
"i took one last look at the natural wonders and artistic treasures amassed in the museum , this unrivaled collection doomed to perish someday in the depths of the seas , together with its curator . i wanted to establish one supreme impression in my mind . i stayed there an hour , basking in the aura of the ceiling lights , passing in review the treasures shining in their glass cases . then i returned to my stateroom . there i dressed in sturdy seafaring clothes . i gathered my notes and packed them tenderly about my person . my heart was pounding mightily . i could n't curb its pulsations . my anxiety and agitation would certainly have given me away if captain nemo had seen me .",91
"the last words in his note - book were these : "" a southern rifleman has just taken aim at me , but-- "" the southerner notwithstanding missed gideon spilett , who , with his usual fortune , came out of this affair without a scratch .",5
"i went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning 's conversation for holmes . it was evident to me that he had been very busy of late , for the notes which i had from baker street were few and short , with no comments upon the information which i had supplied and hardly any reference to my mission . no doubt his blackmailing case is absorbing all his faculties . and yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his interest . i wish that he were here .",36
"the reporter , to whom his tedious captivity did not offer a single incident worthy of note , could stand it no longer .",16
"miss gryce snored at last ; she was a heavy welshwoman , and till now her habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light than as a nuisance ; to - night i hailed the first deep notes with satisfaction ; i was debarrassed of interruption ; my half - effaced thought instantly revived .",42
"i mean the breadfruit tree , which is quite abundant on gueboroa island , and there i chiefly noted the seedless variety that in malaysia is called "" rima . """,18
"feverish with vain labour , i got up and took a turn in the room ; undrew the curtain , noted a star or two , shivered with cold , and again crept to bed .",20
"they found him holding his leave of absence in one hand , and m. de treville â€™s note in the other .",17
"his reserve had been always excessive and habitual . i was aware , however , that his very ancient family had been noted , time out of mind , for a peculiar sensibility of temperament , displaying itself , through long ages , in many works of exalted art , and manifested , of late , in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity , as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies , perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognizable beauties , of musical science .",22
"a note was accordingly addressed to that lady , who returned for answer , that "" i might do as i pleased : she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs . """,1
"during the night , in line with my forecasts , a new one - meter slice was removed from this immense socket . but in the morning , wearing my diving suit , i was crossing through the liquid mass in a temperature of -6 degrees to -7 degrees centigrade , when i noted that little by little the side walls were closing in on each other . the liquid strata farthest from the trench , not warmed by the movements of workmen and tools , were showing a tendency to solidify . in the face of this imminent new danger , what would happen to our chances for salvation , and how could we prevent this liquid medium from solidifying , then cracking the nautilus 's hull like glass ?",53
"thus m. de treville was praised to the highest note by these men , who adored him , and who , ruffians as they were , trembled before him like scholars before their master , obedient to his least word , and ready to sacrifice themselves to wash out the smallest insult .",9
""" when i wanted to determine what increase in weight the nautilus needed to be given in order to submerge , i had only to take note of the proportionate reduction in volume that salt water experiences in deeper and deeper strata . """,26
"these dates were inscribed in an itinerary divided into columns , indicating the month , the day of the month , and the day for the stipulated and actual arrivals at each principal point paris , brindisi , suez , bombay , calcutta , singapore , hong kong , yokohama , san francisco , new york , and london -- from the 2nd of october to the 21st of december ; and giving a space for setting down the gain made or the loss suffered on arrival at each locality . this methodical record thus contained an account of everything needed , and mr . fogg always knew whether he was behind - hand or in advance of his time . on this friday , october 9th , he noted his arrival at suez , and observed that he had as yet neither gained nor lost . he sat down quietly to breakfast in his cabin , never once thinking of inspecting the town , being one of those englishmen who are wo nt to see foreign countries through the eyes of their domestics .",129

""" this statement came from mrs . charpentier 's lips with many gasps and pauses . at times she spoke so low that i could hardly catch the words . i made shorthand notes of all that she said , however , so that there should be no possibility of a mistake . """,33
kitty drew a little note from her bosom .,4
"how different it was with material things ! where had they passed to ? where was the great crocus - coloured robe , on which the gods fought against the giants , that had been worked by brown girls for the pleasure of athena ? where the huge velarium that nero had stretched across the colosseum at rome , that titan sail of purple on which was represented the starry sky , and apollo driving a chariot drawn by white , gilt - reined steeds ? he longed to see the curious table - napkins wrought for the priest of the sun , on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast ; the mortuary cloth of king chilperic , with its three hundred golden bees ; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the bishop of pontus and were figured with "" lions , panthers , bears , dogs , forests , rocks , hunters -- all , in fact , that a painter can copy from nature "" ; and the coat that charles of orleans once wore , on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning "" madame , je suis tout joyeux , "" the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread , and each note , of square shape in those days , formed with four pearls .",225
"the platform emerged only eighty centimeters above the waves . the nautilus 's bow and stern boasted that spindle - shaped outline that had caused the ship to be compared appropriately to a long cigar . i noted the slight overlap of its sheet - iron plates , which resembled the scales covering the bodies of our big land reptiles . so i had a perfectly natural explanation for why , despite the best spyglasses , this boat had always been mistaken for a marine animal .",37
""" nothing is easier , "" said i , putting down figures in my note book . "" nine times a hundred and twenty - five feet gives a depth of eleven hundred and twenty - five feet . """,14

""" surely , but as we move ahead to the far end of this gulf , you 'll note its odd appearance . i recall seeing the bay of el tur completely red , like a lake of blood . """,18
""" yes , my gallant ned , "" conseil replied . "" and note well , even when one has grasped all this , one still knows next to nothing , because these families are subdivided into genera , subgenera , species , varieties-- """,13
the subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer ; but i suppose the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy warbled with the lisp of childhood ; and in very bad taste that point was : at least i thought so .,22
"i remark that professor liedenbrock has a tendency to relapse into an impatient mood , and i make a note of it in my log . all my danger and sufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him ; but now that i am well his nature has resumed its sway . and yet , what cause was there for anger ? is not the voyage prospering as favourably as possible under the circumstances ? is not the raft spinning along with marvellous speed ?",19
"on this note i was about to withdraw ; but captain nemo detained me and invited me to take a seat next to him . he questioned me with interest on our excursions ashore and on our hunting , but seemed not to understand the canadian 's passionate craving for red meat . then our conversation skimmed various subjects , and without being more forthcoming , captain nemo proved more affable .",2
"as soon as i was dressed , i made my way to the main lounge . it was deserted . i dove into studying the conchological treasures amassed inside the glass cases . i also investigated the huge plant albums that were filled with the rarest marine herbs , which , although they were pressed and dried , still kept their wonderful colors . among these valuable water plants , i noted various seaweed : some cladostephus verticillatus , peacock 's tails , fig - leafed caulerpa , grain - bearing beauty bushes , delicate rosetangle tinted scarlet , sea colander arranged into fan shapes , mermaid 's cups that looked like the caps of squat mushrooms and for years had been classified among the zoophytes ; in short , a complete series of algae .",71
"but after all , as conseil noted , we enjoyed complete freedom , we were daintily and abundantly fed . our host had kept to the terms of his agreement . we could n't complain , and moreover the very uniqueness of our situation had such generous rewards in store for us , we had no grounds for criticism .",6
""" i am afraid , my dear watson , that most of your conclusions were erroneous . when i said that you stimulated me i meant , to be frank , that in noting your fallacies i was occasionally guided towards the truth . not that you are entirely wrong in this instance . the man is certainly a country practitioner . and he walks a good deal . """,33
"i was pursuing the policy that we had seen the last of him , when on november 16 , while reentering my stateroom with ned and conseil , i found a note addressed to me on the table .",31
the note was worded as follows :,1
""" well , i sometimes think we are too quiet ; but we run a chance of being busy enough now : for a little while at least , "" said mrs . fairfax , still holding the note before her spectacles .",38
"i was a mile from thornfield , in a lane noted for wild roses in summer , for nuts and blackberries in autumn , and even now possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws , but whose best winter delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose .",10
"they were almost famished ; fortunately , the larder was not far off , and neb was noted for being an expeditious cook .",17
"near two o'clock i was busy organizing my notes in the lounge , when the captain opened the door and appeared . i bowed to him . he gave me an almost imperceptible bow in return , without saying a word to me . i resumed my work , hoping he might give me some explanation of the previous afternoon 's events . he did nothing of the sort . i stared at him . his face looked exhausted ; his reddened eyes had n't been refreshed by sleep ; his facial features expressed profound sadness , real chagrin . he walked up and down , sat and stood , picked up a book at random , discarded it immediately , consulted his instruments without taking his customary notes , and seemed unable to rest easy for an instant .",128
"i assented gladly , and we all descended together . our prisoner made no attempt at escape , but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his , and we followed him . lestrade mounted the box , whipped up the horse , and brought us in a very short time to our destination . we were ushered into a small chamber where a police inspector noted down our prisoner 's name and the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged . the official was a white - faced unemotional man , who went through his duties in a dull mechanical way . "" the prisoner will be put before the magistrates in the course of the week , "" he said ; "" in the mean time , mr . jefferson hope , have you anything that you wish to say ? i must warn you that your words will be taken down , and may be used against you . """,67
"with these words , jefferson hope leaned back in his chair and began the following remarkable statement . he spoke in a calm and methodical manner , as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough . i can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account , for i have had access to lestrade 's note - book , in which the prisoner 's words were taken down exactly as they were uttered .",57
"among others i noted that sand goby mentioned by aristotle and commonly known by the name sea loach , which is encountered exclusively in the salty waters next to the nile delta . near them some semiphosphorescent red porgy rolled by , a variety of gilthead that the egyptians ranked among their sacred animals , lauding them in religious ceremonies when their arrival in the river 's waters announced the fertile flood season . i also noticed some wrasse known as the tapiro , three decimeters long , bony fish with transparent scales whose bluish gray color is mixed with red spots ; they 're enthusiastic eaters of marine vegetables , which gives them an exquisite flavor ; hence these tapiro were much in demand by the epicures of ancient rome , and their entrails were dressed with brains of peacock , tongue of flamingo , and testes of moray to make that divine platter that so enraptured the roman emperor vitellius .",3
"our return journey began . captain nemo resumed the lead in our little band , always heading forward without hesitation . i noted that we did n't follow the same path in returning to the nautilus . this new route , very steep and hence very arduous , quickly took us close to the surface of the sea . but this return to the upper strata was n't so sudden that decompression took place too quickly , which could have led to serious organic disorders and given us those internal injuries so fatal to divers . with great promptness , the light reappeared and grew stronger ; and the refraction of the sun , already low on the horizon , again ringed the edges of various objects with the entire color spectrum .",22
"a note was fastened to his neck , and cyrus harding read these words , traced in neb 's large writing:--""no pirates in the neighborhood of granite house .",1
"sheer chance had placed me in the presence of the most valuable specimens of this zoophyte . this coral was the equal of those fished up from the mediterranean off the barbary coast or the shores of france and italy . with its bright colors , it lived up to those poetic names of blood flower and blood foam that the industry confers on its finest exhibits . coral sells for as much as 500 francs per kilogram , and in this locality the liquid strata hid enough to make the fortunes of a whole host of coral fishermen . this valuable substance often merges with other polyparies , forming compact , hopelessly tangled units known as "" macciota , "" and i noted some wonderful pink samples of this coral .",123
"i meticulously noted these different depths , obtaining the underwater profile of this upside - down mountain chain that stretched beneath the sea .",2
after breakfast the professor gave a few hours to the arrangement of his daily notes .,14
"the sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass , or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine , seemed to make the stillness more oppressive . the dim roar of london was like the bourdon note of a distant organ .",47
"dâ€™artagnan was at the height of joy ; he had realized the plan he had imagined beforehand , whose picturing had produced the smiles we noted upon his face .",25
dâ€™artagnan was amazed to note by what fragile and unknown threads the destinies of nations and the lives of men are suspended .,4
""" but , "" as the engineer justly observed , "" that could not take the place of a regular bridge ! "" so , the construction of a regular bridge was noted in the list of future works .",32
"among other fowl i noted some sheathbills from the wading - bird family , the size of pigeons , white in color , the beak short and conical , the eyes framed by red circles . conseil laid in a supply of them , because when they 're properly cooked , these winged creatures make a pleasant dish . in the air there passed sooty albatross with four - meter wingspans , birds aptly dubbed "" vultures of the ocean , "" also gigantic petrels including several with arching wings , enthusiastic eaters of seal that are known as quebrantahuesos , and cape pigeons , a sort of small duck , the tops of their bodies black and white -- in short , a whole series of petrels , some whitish with wings trimmed in brown , others blue and exclusive to these antarctic seas , the former "" so oily , "" i told conseil , "" that inhabitants of the faroe islands simply fit the bird with a wick , then light it up . """,4
""" here is his letter , "" said dâ€™artagnan , and he presented the note to his comrades .",14
"for his part , conseil thought he spotted a turtle six feet wide and adorned with three protruding ridges that ran lengthwise . i was sorry to miss this reptile , because from conseil 's description , i believe i recognized the leatherback turtle , a pretty rare species . for my part , i noted only some loggerhead turtles with long carapaces .",55
"the king turned pale , and shut his note - book hastily . ' consider your verdict , ' he said to the jury , in a low , trembling voice .",8
