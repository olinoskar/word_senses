""" a good voyage to you , "" shouted the sailor , who himself did not expect any great result from this mode of correspondence .",19
i liked to learn of her : i saw the part of instructress pleased and suited her ; that of scholar pleased and suited me no less . our natures dovetailed : mutual affection -- of the strongest kind -- was the result .,42
""" oh , gracious , mama ! spare us the enumeration ! _ au reste _ , we all know them : danger of bad example to innocence of childhood ; distractions and consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached -- mutual alliance and reliance ; confidence thence resulting -- insolence accompanying -- mutiny and general blow - up .",51
"this idea soon became so insupportable to her that at the risk of whatever terrible consequences might result to herself from it , she implored the captain to put her on shore ; but the captain , eager to escape from his false position -- placed between french and english cruisers , like the bat between the mice and the birds -- was in great haste to regain england , and positively refused to obey what he took for a woman ’s caprice , promising his passenger , who had been particularly recommended to him by the cardinal , to land her , if the sea and the french permitted him , at one of the ports of brittany , either at lorient or brest . but the wind was contrary , the sea bad ; they tacked and kept offshore .",17
""" then i believe you . you appear to be a brave young man ; besides , your fortune may perhaps be the result of your devotedness . """,23
"this was the last straw , and it resulted in arousing public passions all over again . indeed , from this moment on , any maritime casualty without an established cause was charged to the monster 's account . this outrageous animal had to shoulder responsibility for all derelict vessels , whose numbers are unfortunately considerable , since out of those 3,000 ships whose losses are recorded annually at the marine insurance bureau , the figure for steam or sailing ships supposedly lost with all hands , in the absence of any news , amounts to at least 200 !",8
"the way in which the battery was composed was as follows , and the results were to be attained by the reaction of acid and potash on each other .",14
"besides , his intention was formed to make the brave musketeer all suitable apologies , but without meanness or weakness , fearing that might result from this duel which generally results from an affair of this kind , when a young and vigorous man fights with an adversary who is wounded and weakened -- if conquered , he doubles the triumph of his antagonist ; if a conqueror , he is accused of foul play and want of courage .",24

"' what can all that green stuff be ? ' said alice . ' and where have my shoulders got to ? and oh , my poor hands , how is it i ca n't see you ? ' she was moving them about as she spoke , but no result seemed to follow , except a little shaking among the distant green leaves .",50
"now , to obtain this result , it had to be treated either with soda or lime .",5
"the juncture was favorable . the english , who require , above everything , good living in order to be good soldiers , only eating salt meat and bad biscuit , had many invalids in their camp . still further , the sea , very rough at this period of the year all along the sea coast , destroyed every day some little vessel ; and the shore , from the point of l’aiguillon to the trenches , was at every tide literally covered with the wrecks of pinnacles , roberges , and feluccas . the result was that even if the king ’s troops remained quietly in their camp , it was evident that some day or other , buckingham , who only continued in the isle from obstinacy , would be obliged to raise the siege .",96
"when given , he viewed me to learn the result ; it was not striking : i am sure i did not blush ; perhaps i might have turned a little pale , for i felt as if this kiss were a seal affixed to my fetters .",9
"neither top nor jup , who accompanied him , ever betrayed by their behavior that there was anything strange there , and yet more than once again the dog barked at the mouth of the well , which the engineer had before explored without result .",44
"the dictation commenced . i did my best . every letter was given me one after the other , with the following remarkable result :",23
"his companions were still ignorant of this , for he had not informed them of the result at which he aimed .",16
"however , the use of pyroxyle was to be continued , for this substance giving excellent results , there was no reason for substituting ordinary powder .",16
"it was indeed a valuable result of their labor , and a very opportune one .",5
"the result of these reflections was that d’artagnan , without asking information of any kind , alighted , commended the horses to the care of his lackey , entered a small room destined to receive those who wished to be alone , and desired the host to bring him a bottle of his best wine and as good a breakfast as possible -- a desire which further corroborated the high opinion the innkeeper had formed of the traveler at first sight .",1
"miss eyre , i beg your pardon . the fact is , once for all , i do n't wish to treat you like an inferior : that is "" ( correcting himself ) , "" i claim only such superiority as must result from twenty years ' difference in age and a century 's advance in experience .",43
"the result was that , thanks to these attentions , the stranger resumed a more human appearance , and it even seemed as if his eyes had become milder .",1
"the result of these different works was , that , on the 9th of april , the engineer had at his disposal a quantity of prepared lime and some thousands of bricks .",1
"the chief thing was to hinder these plunderers from reaching the plateau , for the garden and the poultry - yard would then have been at their mercy , and immense , perhaps irreparable mischief , would inevitably be the result , especially with regard to the corn - field .",40
"i obeyed , and with this result :",6
"the noble and distinguished air of athos , those flashes of greatness which from time to time broke out from the shade in which he voluntarily kept himself , that unalterable equality of temper which made him the most pleasant companion in the world , that forced and cynical gaiety , that bravery which might have been termed blind if it had not been the result of the rarest coolness -- such qualities attracted more than the esteem , more than the friendship of d’artagnan ; they attracted his admiration .",65
"the result was , that a short time after the operation the level of the lake would be lowered two feet , or more .",1
it worked and worked faster : i felt the pulses throb in my head and temples ; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos ; and no result came of its efforts .,29
"is it not , by its noble cares and sublime results , the one best calculated to fill the void left by uptorn affections and demolished hopes ?",10
"but who could have foretold the result ? a violent thump made the furniture rattle , and spilt some ink , and my pen dropped from between my fingers .",6
"the sportsmen of the island therefore soon had a perfectly prepared substance , which , employed discreetly , produced admirable results .",20
"but not being contented with simply the produce , they made chase after the producers , the result of which was that they were able to bring back to granite house a dozen of these chelonians , which were really valuable from an alimentary point of view .",17
"the reporter could not affirm it , but he and his companions almost despaired of the result .",16
""" you do me too much honour , "" said holmes , gravely . "" let us hear how you arrived at this most gratifying result . """,25
"she passed about five minutes each day in her mother 's sick - room , and no more . eliza still spoke little : she had evidently no time to talk . i never saw a busier person than she seemed to be ; yet it was difficult to say what she did : or rather , to discover any result of her diligence .",60
"but this reply proved nothing , other than how bullheaded the harpooner could be . that day i pressed him no further . the scotia 's accident was undeniable . its hole was real enough that it had to be plugged up , and i do n't think a hole 's existence can be more emphatically proven . now then , this hole did n't make itself , and since it had n't resulted from underwater rocks or underwater machines , it must have been caused by the perforating tool of some animal .",73
"if you knew it , you are peculiarly situated : very near happiness ; yes , within reach of it . the materials are all prepared ; there only wants a movement to combine them . chance laid them somewhat apart ; let them be once approached and bliss results . """,49
"after several fruitless attempts , which resulted in nothing but scaring the grouse , the sailor said to the lad,--",6
""" yes , master , drunk from the nutmegs it was devouring under that nutmeg tree where i caught it . see , ned my friend , see the monstrous results of intemperance ! """,30

"in a state between sleeping and waking , you noticed her entrance and her actions ; but feverish , almost delirious as you were , you ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her own : the long dishevelled hair , the swelled black face , the exaggerated stature , were figments of imagination ; results of nightmare : the spiteful tearing of the veil was real : and it is like her .",56
"then each of these men retreated as far as the ditch , from which each took a concealed musket ; the result was that our seven travelers were outnumbered in weapons .",21
"it was the hour of study ; they were engaged in conning over their to - morrow 's task , and the hum i had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions .",29
""" the flame flickers in the eye ; the eye shines like dew ; it looks soft and full of feeling ; it smiles at my jargon : it is susceptible ; impression follows impression through its clear sphere ; where it ceases to smile , it is sad ; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid : that signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness . it turns from me ; it will not suffer further scrutiny ; it seems to deny , by a mocking glance , the truth of the discoveries i have already made,--to disown the charge both of sensibility and chagrin : its pride and reserve only confirm me in my opinion .",61
"all the consequences likely to result from this incident , notwithstanding its apparent insignificance , immediately took possession of their minds .",5
"holmes had taken out his watch , and as minute followed minute without result , an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared upon his features . he gnawed his lip , drummed his fingers upon the table , and showed every other symptom of acute impatience . so great was his emotion , that i felt sincerely sorry for him , while the two detectives smiled derisively , by no means displeased at this check which he had met .",13
"the result is that the gulf is completely sheltered on all sides , and i believe that even in the stormiest weather , the sea here must be as calm as a lake . """,1
""" however , i should be disposed to conjecture that this peculiarity results from the situation of the island in the southern hemisphere , which , as you know , my boy , is colder than the northern hemisphere . """,12
"other quantities of the substance in a state of fusion were added to the first , and in a short time the result was a bubble which measured a foot in diameter .",22
the equality between her and me was real ; not the mere result of condescension on her part : so much the better -- my position was all the freer .,12
"but the result of this discovery of the chest was , that it was now more than ever necessary to explore the island thoroughly .",2
"the result was discoverable , he added , in that silent yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family , and which made him what i now saw him — what he was .",1
"however , this uncertainty could not last , and when once the lad should have recovered , the expedition , the result of which must be so important , would be undertaken .",21
""" gentlemen , gentlemen , "" cried d’artagnan , who began to get a glimpse of the result of the adventure , "" the thing is serious . let us try not to jest , if we can .",17
"mr . st . john came but once : he looked at me , and said my state of lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted fatigue .",22
"like true settlers , the colonists spared the largest and most beautiful trees , which would besides have cost immense labor to fell , and the small ones only were sacrificed , but the result was that the road took a very winding direction , and lengthened itself by numerous detours .",34
"all my confidence is bestowed on him , all his confidence is devoted to me ; we are precisely suited in character -- perfect concord is the result .",27
""" you know i am a scoundrel , jane ? "" ere long he inquired wistfully -- wondering , i suppose , at my continued silence and tameness , the result rather of weakness than of will .",30
"the operation was extremely simple , and if it did not yield absolutely perfect results , they were at least very useful .",14
""" thank you : i shall do : i have no broken bones,--only a sprain ; "" and again he stood up and tried his foot , but the result extorted an involuntary "" ugh ! """,29
"it was not only that they were extremely anxious to find out the cause of what had happened , whether it was the result of an accident which would be discovered at the return of day , or whether on the contrary it was the work of a human being ; but they also had very uncomfortable beds .",23
"from this deficiency of nourishment resulted an abuse , which pressed hardly on the younger pupils : whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity , they would coax or menace the little ones out of their portion .",5
"before she went to bed she had pondered , analyzed , turned on all sides , examined on all points , the words , the steps , the gestures , the signs , and even the silence of her interlocutors ; and of this profound , skillful , and anxious study the result was that felton , everything considered , appeared the more vulnerable of her two persecutors .",52
"besides this , as every great action bears its recompense with it , the brave exploit of d’artagnan resulted in the restoration of the tranquility he had lost .",18
"the nets were hauled on board . they were a breed of trawl resembling those used off the normandy coast , huge pouches held half open by a floating pole and a chain laced through the lower meshes . trailing in this way from these iron glove makers , the resulting receptacles scoured the ocean floor and collected every marine exhibit in their path . that day they gathered up some unusual specimens from these fish - filled waterways : anglerfish whose comical movements qualify them for the epithet "" clowns , "" black commerson anglers equipped with their antennas , undulating triggerfish encircled by little red bands , bloated puffers whose venom is extremely insidious , some olive - hued lampreys , snipefish covered with silver scales , cutlass fish whose electrocuting power equals that of the electric eel and the electric ray , scaly featherbacks with brown crosswise bands , greenish codfish , several varieties of goby , etc . ; finally , some fish of larger proportions : a one - meter jack with a prominent head , several fine bonito from the genus scomber decked out in the colors blue and silver , and three magnificent tuna whose high speeds could n't save them from our trawl .",50
"it was necessary to put an end to the struggle , which had lasted for ten minutes , and which would result in the triumph of the sioux if the train was not stopped . fort kearney station , where there was a garrison , was only two miles distant ; but , that once passed , the sioux would be masters of the train between fort kearney and the station beyond .",21
"it resulted , then , from this habit that on the said first monday of april , 1625 , the citizens , on hearing the clamor , and seeing neither the red - and - yellow standard nor the livery of the duc de richelieu , rushed toward the hostel of the jolly miller .",1
"the result of the treaty was , that hans engaged on his part to conduct us to the village of stapi , on the south shore of the snæfell peninsula , at the very foot of the volcano . by land this would be about twenty - two miles , to be done , said my uncle , in two days .",1
""" well , admitting all your calculations to be quite correct , you must allow me to draw one rigid result therefrom . """,20
"as the sea went down , they searched every little crevice with no result .",13
"last january , rid of all mistresses -- in a harsh , bitter frame of mind , the result of a useless , roving , lonely life -- corroded with disappointment , sourly disposed against all men , and especially against all womankind ( for i began to regard the notion of an intellectual , faithful , loving woman as a mere dream ) , recalled by business , i came back to england .",18
