the reporter recounted all that they had done in their attempt to recover cyrus harding .,10
i was wrong to attempt to deceive you ; but i feared a stubbornness that exists in your character . i feared early instilled prejudice : i wanted to have you safe before hazarding confidences .,4
""" who is this ? who is this ? "" he demanded , trying , as it seemed , to _ see _ with those sightless eyes -- unavailing and distressing attempt !",31
"as for captain nemo , i wondered what he would make of our escaping , what concern or perhaps what distress it might cause him , and what he would do in the twofold event of our attempt either failing or being found out ! certainly i had no complaints to register with him , on the contrary . never was hospitality more wholehearted than his . yet in leaving him i could n't be accused of ingratitude . no solemn promises bound us to him . in order to keep us captive , he had counted only on the force of circumstances and not on our word of honor . but his avowed intention to imprison us forever on his ship justified our every effort .",37
"however , they were obliged to give up , for this night at least , the attempt to procure fire .",16
this was what harding was going to attempt with the minerals which nature placed at his disposal .,7
"then i began to lose my head . i arose with my arms stretched out before me , attempting painfully to feel my way . i began to run wildly , hurrying through the inextricable maze , still descending , still running through the substance of the earth 's thick crust , a struggling denizen of geological ' faults , ' crying , shouting , yelling , soon bruised by contact with the jagged rock , falling and rising again bleeding , trying to drink the blood which covered my face , and even waiting for some rock to shatter my skull against .",18
"d’artagnan unfolded it with one hand , whose trembling he did not even attempt to conceal , to read :",13
""" yes , sir , "" said the negro ; "" it is the custom here . they give a linen garment twice a year , and that is all our covering . when we labor in the sugar works , and the mill happens to snatch hold of a finger , they instantly chop off our hand ; and when we attempt to run away , they cut off a leg .",62
""" my inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait did not lie , and that this fellow was indeed a baskerville . he was a son of that rodger baskerville , the younger brother of sir charles , who fled with a sinister reputation to south america , where he was said to have died unmarried . he did , as a matter of fact , marry , and had one child , this fellow , whose real name is the same as his father 's . he married beryl garcia , one of the beauties of costa rica , and , having purloined a considerable sum of public money , he changed his name to vandeleur and fled to england , where he established a school in the east of yorkshire . his reason for attempting this special line of business was that he had struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon the voyage home , and that he had used this man 's ability to make the undertaking a success . fraser , the tutor , died however , and the school which had begun well sank from disrepute into infamy . the vandeleurs found it convenient to change their name to stapleton , and he brought the remains of his fortune , his schemes for the future , and his taste for entomology to the south of england . i learned at the british museum that he was a recognized authority upon the subject , and that the name of vandeleur has been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had , in his yorkshire days , been the first to describe .",138
""" good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific laws . their origin is pure vanity . their result is absolutely nil . they give us , now and then , some of those luxurious sterile emotions that have a certain charm for the weak . that is all that can be said for them . they are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they have no account . """,5
st . john called me to his side to read ; in attempting to do this my voice failed me : words were lost in sobs .,12
"these attempts did not prevent the cardinal , to whom his most inveterate detractors have never denied personal bravery , from making nocturnal excursions , sometimes to communicate to the duc d’angouleme important orders , sometimes to confer with the king , and sometimes to have an interview with a messenger whom he did not wish to see at home .",1
"he calculated that they were still five or six miles from the coast , and this distance was too great for them to attempt during the night in the midst of unknown woods .",23
"i mention this in your hearing , jane , that you may not attempt to impose on mr . brocklehurst . """,13
"some extraordinary opportunity was needed to make the attempt with any chance of success , and this opportunity not only did not present itself , but was very difficult to find .",8
"several times had he even made the attempt , but was stopped by some insurmountable obstacle .",7
"it trembled for mr . rochester and his doom ; it bemoaned him with bitter pity ; it demanded him with ceaseless longing ; and , impotent as a bird with both wings broken , it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain attempts to seek him .",43
but if they did not pass it was not for want of having attempted it .,13
"he then made a few steps toward the sea , and his look brightened with extreme animation , but he did not make the slightest attempt to escape .",25
"the writer spoke of acute bodily illness — of a mental disorder which oppressed him — and of an earnest desire to see me , as his best and indeed his only personal friend , with a view of attempting , by the cheerfulness of my society , some alleviation of his malady . it was the manner in which all this , and much more , was said — it was the apparent heart that went with his request — which allowed me no room for hesitation ; and i accordingly obeyed forthwith what i still considered a very singular summons .",39
"it would clearly have been to the master 's advantage to carry his passengers to yokohama , since he was paid a certain sum per day ; but he would have been rash to attempt such a voyage , and it was imprudent even to attempt to reach shanghai . but john bunsby believed in the tankadere , which rode on the waves like a seagull ; and perhaps he was not wrong .",45
""" stay , "" replied mr . fogg calmly , without betraying in his features that by a supreme inspiration he was about to attempt once more to conquer ill - fortune .",24
""" i just do n't attempt to explain it . it seems the very maddest , queerest thing that ever happened to me . """,5
nearly every day they attempted sorties which they could not prolong .,4
"there ayrton recounted all that had passed , even to his plan for blowing up the brig , which he had attempted to put into execution .",21
"after several fruitless attempts , which resulted in nothing but scaring the grouse , the sailor said to the lad,--",3
"passepartout , when he saw his master arrested , would have fallen upon fix had he not been held back by some policemen . aouda was thunderstruck at the suddenness of an event which she could not understand . passepartout explained to her how it was that the honest and courageous fogg was arrested as a robber . the young woman 's heart revolted against so heinous a charge , and when she saw that she could attempt to do nothing to save her protector , she wept bitterly .",77
"the frigate sailed along the east coast of south america with prodigious speed . by july 3 we were at the entrance to the strait of magellan , abreast of cabo de las virgenes . but commander farragut was unwilling to attempt this tortuous passageway and maneuvered instead to double cape horn . the crew sided with him unanimously . indeed , were we likely to encounter the narwhale in such a cramped strait ? many of our sailors swore that the monster could n't negotiate this passageway simply because "" he 's too big for it ! """,41
"the pirates , on their side , did not appear to have made any attempt to land .",14
"distracted between these two passions he took his gold and his diamonds , and procured a person to conduct him and martin to the house where miss cunegund lodged . upon entering the room he felt his limbs tremble , his heart flutter , his tongue falter ; he attempted to undraw the curtain , and called for a light to the bedside .",49
"it was the first time that he had ever seen birds taken with a line , but the sailor modestly confessed that it was not his first attempt , and that besides he could not claim the merit of invention .",27
"you should , therefore , dare all in the attempt to leave lincoln island , and see once more the land of your birth .",9
"he recalled , all at once , the warnings of lord de winter , the seductions of milady , her first attempts after her arrival . he drew back a step , and hung down his head , without , however , ceasing to look at her , as if , fascinated by this strange creature , he could not detach his eyes from her eyes .",21
"i felt how -- if i were his wife , this good man , pure as the deep sunless source , could soon kill me , without drawing from my veins a single drop of blood , or receiving on his own crystal conscience the faintest stain of crime . especially i felt this when i made any attempt to propitiate him .",58
"the night before he left home , happening to see him walking in the garden about sunset , and remembering , as i looked at him , that this man , alienated as he now was , had once saved my life , and that we were near relations , i was moved to make a last attempt to regain his friendship .",57
"there was only the longitude to be obtained , and the position of the island would be determined , the engineer hoped to attempt this the same day , at twelve o'clock , at which moment the sun would pass the meridian .",23
"and thus , as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit , the more bitterly did i perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness , as if an inherent positive quality , poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe in one unceasing radiation of gloom .",31
i neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade her from it .,8
i deeply venerated my cousin 's talent and principle . his friendship was of value to me : to lose it tried me severely . i would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it .,32
"d’artagnan continued : "" before god and before men , i accuse this woman of having attempted to poison me , in wine which she sent me from villeroy , with a forged letter , as if that wine came from my friends . god preserved me , but a man named brisemont died in my place . """,16
"however , it was soon evident to cyrus harding , on observing the direction followed by the boat , that they would not attempt to penetrate into the channel , but would land on the islet .",23
""" now you will indeed hate me , "" i said . "" it is useless to attempt to conciliate you : i see i have made an eternal enemy of you . """,17
"an attempt was also made for the domestication of the peccaries , which succeeded well .",1
"as to going to meet him , or attempting to find him , it was impossible .",8
"we cut the equator . twenty miles to the west lay guiana , french territory where we could easily have taken refuge . but the wind was blowing a strong gust , and the furious billows would not allow us to face them in a mere skiff . no doubt ned land understood this because he said nothing to me . for my part , i made no allusion to his escape plans because i did n't want to push him into an attempt that was certain to misfire .",83
"if the pirates continued to attack them in this way , if they renewed their attempt to land by means of a boat , they could be destroyed one by one .",15
"about this time , too , cyrus harding attempted to manufacture glass , and he at first put the old pottery - kiln to this new use .",8
"there were some difficulties to be encountered ; but , after several fruitless attempts , he succeeded in setting up a glass manufactory , which gideon spilett and herbert , his usual assistants , did not leave for several days .",13
"but my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that nothing could resist ; and though i had several times loud calls from my reason and my more composed judgment to go home , yet i had no power to do it . i know not what to call this , nor will i urge that it is a secret overruling decree , that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own destruction , even though it be before us , and that we rush upon it with our eyes open . certainly , nothing but some such decreed unavoidable misery , which it was impossible for me to escape , could have pushed me forward against the calm reasonings and persuasions of my most retired thoughts , and against two such visible instructions as i had met with in my first attempt .",146
""" be silent , madame , "" cried felton , "" and do not speak to me thus ; i came to entreat you to promise me upon your honor , to swear to me by what you hold most sacred , that you will make no attempt upon your life . """,47
"after about two years , an odd circumstance presented itself , which put the old thought of making some attempt for my liberty again in my head . my patron lying at home longer than usual without fitting out his ship , which , as i heard , was for want of money , he used constantly , once or twice a week , sometimes oftener if the weather was fair , to take the ship ’s pinnace and go out into the road a - fishing ; and as he always took me and young maresco with him to row the boat , we made him very merry , and i proved very dexterous in catching fish ; insomuch that sometimes he would send me with a moor , one of his kinsmen , and the youth — the maresco , as they called him — to catch a dish of fish for him .",19
"the canadian was quite disheartened , having counted on putting his plans into execution in the gulf , either by reaching shore or by pulling alongside one of the many boats plying a coastal trade from one island to another . an escape attempt would have been quite feasible , assuming ned land managed to seize the skiff without the captain 's knowledge . but in midocean it was unthinkable .",43
"at these words , which left no hope , milady raised herself in all her pride , and wished to speak ; but her strength failed her . she felt that a powerful and implacable hand seized her by the hair , and dragged her away as irrevocably as fatality drags humanity . she did not , therefore , even attempt the least resistance , and went out of the cottage .",60
it was very evident that lincoln island was at such a distance from every country or island that it would be too hazardous to attempt to reach one in a frail boat .,24
"but as to entering the channel , pencroft , contrary to ayrton 's opinion , could not believe that she would dare to attempt it .",23
"a tall bulgarian soldier , six feet high , perceiving that i had fainted away at this sight , attempted to ravish me ; the operation brought me to my senses . i cried , i struggled , i bit , i scratched , i would have torn the tall bulgarian 's eyes out , not knowing that what had happened at my father 's castle was a customary thing . the brutal soldier , enraged at my resistance , gave me a wound in my left leg with his hanger , the mark of which i still carry .

"she appeared to be cross - questioning me , attempting to draw from me information unawares .",9
""" the nautilus is not aground , sir , "" captain nemo replied icily . "" the nautilus was built to rest on the ocean floor , and i do n't need to undertake the arduous labors , the maneuvers d'urville had to attempt in order to float off his sloops of war . the zealous and the new astrolabe wellnigh perished , but my nautilus is in no danger . tomorrow , on the day stated and at the hour stated , the tide will peacefully lift it off , and it will resume its navigating through the seas .

""" just this . in 1861 , to the northeast of tenerife and fairly near the latitude where we are right now , the crew of the gunboat alecto spotted a monstrous squid swimming in their waters . commander bouguer approached the animal and attacked it with blows from harpoons and blasts from rifles , but without much success because bullets and harpoons crossed its soft flesh as if it were semiliquid jelly . after several fruitless attempts , the crew managed to slip a noose around the mollusk 's body . this noose slid as far as the caudal fins and came to a halt . then they tried to haul the monster on board , but its weight was so considerable that when they tugged on the rope , the animal parted company with its tail ; and deprived of this adornment , it disappeared beneath the waters .

"pale and trembling , milady repulsed d’artagnan ’s attempted embrace by a violent blow on the chest , as she sprang out of bed .",8
""" i am ignorant of all concerning mr . rochester : the letter never mentions him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt i have adverted to .",23
"harding approved entirely , and it was decided that the two wounds should be dressed without attempting to close them by immediate coaptation .",16
"there were few or no bridges or tunnels on the route . the railway turned around the sides of the mountains , and did not attempt to violate nature by taking the shortest cut from one point to another .",25
"then milady attempted to tear down the doorcase , with a strength apparently above that of a woman ; but finding she could not accomplish this , she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard , the point of which repeatedly glittered through the wood .",2

"after a last consultation , the guide announced that he was ready for the attempt , and advanced , followed by the others . they took a roundabout way , so as to get at the pagoda on the rear . they reached the walls about half - past twelve , without having met anyone ; here there was no guard , nor were there either windows or doors .",14
"they set noiselessly to work , and the parsee on one side and passepartout on the other began to loosen the bricks so as to make an aperture two feet wide . they were getting on rapidly , when suddenly a cry was heard in the interior of the temple , followed almost instantly by other cries replying from the outside . passepartout and the guide stopped . had they been heard ? was the alarm being given ? common prudence urged them to retire , and they did so , followed by phileas fogg and sir francis . they again hid themselves in the wood , and waited till the disturbance , whatever it might be , ceased , holding themselves ready to resume their attempt without delay . but , awkwardly enough , the guards now appeared at the rear of the temple , and there installed themselves , in readiness to prevent a surprise .",126
"i made some attempts to draw her into conversation , but she seemed a person of few words : a monosyllabic reply usually cut short every effort of that sort .",3

"i assented gladly , and we all descended together . our prisoner made no attempt at escape , but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his , and we followed him . lestrade mounted the box , whipped up the horse , and brought us in a very short time to our destination . we were ushered into a small chamber where a police inspector noted down our prisoner 's name and the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged . the official was a white - faced unemotional man , who went through his duties in a dull mechanical way .

"upon the whole , as i found by all his discourse a settled affection to me , and that nothing could part him from me , so i found all the foundation of his desire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent affection to the people , and his hopes of my doing them good ; a thing which , as i had no notion of myself , so i had not the least thought or intention , or desire of undertaking it . but still i found a strong inclination to attempting my escape , founded on the supposition gathered from the discourse , that there were seventeen bearded men there ; and therefore , without any more delay , i went to work with friday to find out a great tree proper to fell , and make a large periagua , or canoe , to undertake the voyage . there were trees enough in the island to have built a little fleet , not of periaguas or canoes , but even of good , large vessels ; but the main thing i looked at was , to get one so near the water that we might launch it when it was made , to avoid the mistake i committed at first .",96

"meanwhile preparations for this daring attempt were getting under way . the nautilus 's powerful pumps forced air down into the tanks and stored it under high pressure . near four o'clock captain nemo informed me that the platform hatches were about to be closed . i took a last look at the dense ice bank we were going to conquer . the weather was fair , the skies reasonably clear , the cold quite brisk , namely -12 degrees centigrade ; but after the wind had lulled , this temperature did n't seem too unbearable .",5

"in this voyage i visited my new colony in the island , saw my successors the spaniards , had the old story of their lives and of the villains i left there ; how at first they insulted the poor spaniards , how they afterwards agreed , disagreed , united , separated , and how at last the spaniards were obliged to use violence with them ; how they were subjected to the spaniards , how honestly the spaniards used them — a history , if it were entered into , as full of variety and wonderful accidents as my own part — particularly , also , as to their battles with the caribbeans , who landed several times upon the island , and as to the improvement they made upon the island itself , and how five of them made an attempt upon the mainland , and brought away eleven men and five women prisoners , by which , at my coming , i found about twenty young children on the island .",142
