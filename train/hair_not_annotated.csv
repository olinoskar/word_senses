""" no , my boy , and this whiteness that amazes you is merely due to the presence of myriads of tiny creatures called infusoria , a sort of diminutive glowworm that 's colorless and gelatinous in appearance , as thick as a strand of hair , and no longer than one - fifth of a millimeter . some of these tiny creatures stick together over an area of several leagues . """,45
""" she has the most beautiful light hair imaginable ! """,7
"the one which had been seized in the hall of granite house was a great fellow , six feet high , with an admirably poportioned frame , a broad chest , head of a moderate size , the facial angle reaching sixty - five degrees , round skull , projecting nose , skin covered with soft glossy hair , in short , a fine specimen of the anthropoids .",57
"their size exceeded that of a rabbit , their hair was yellow , mingled with green spots , and they had the merest rudiments of tails .",9
"the officer who had stopped in front of her and studied her with so much care might have been twenty - five or twenty - six years of age . he was of pale complexion , with clear blue eyes , rather deeply set ; his mouth , fine and well cut , remained motionless in its correct lines ; his chin , strongly marked , denoted that strength of will which in the ordinary britannic type denotes mostly nothing but obstinacy ; a brow a little receding , as is proper for poets , enthusiasts , and soldiers , was scarcely shaded by short thin hair which , like the beard which covered the lower part of his face , was of a beautiful deep chestnut color .",106
"from every enjoyment i was , of course , excluded : my share of the gaiety consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of eliza and georgiana , and seeing them descend to the drawing - room , dressed out in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes , with hair elaborately ringletted ; and afterwards , in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played below , to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman , to the jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed , to the broken hum of conversation as the drawing - room door opened and closed .",48
"georgiana sat on a high stool , dressing her hair at the glass , and interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers , of which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic .",9
""" ah , dorian , i am so glad you take it in that way ! i was afraid i would find you plunged in remorse and tearing that nice curly hair of yours . """,31
"many traces we found of him in the bog - girt island where he had hid his savage ally . a huge driving - wheel and a shaft half - filled with rubbish showed the position of an abandoned mine . beside it were the crumbling remains of the cottages of the miners , driven away no doubt by the foul reek of the surrounding swamp . in one of these a staple and chain with a quantity of gnawed bones showed where the animal had been confined . a skeleton with a tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the debris .",96
"porthos knocked with his hand . a tall , pale clerk , his face shaded by a forest of virgin hair , opened the door , and bowed with the air of a man forced at once to respect in another lofty stature , which indicated strength , the military dress , which indicated rank , and a ruddy countenance , which indicated familiarity with good living .",20
"he agreed with his friends on this point , that the stranger must be either english or american , the name britannia leading them to suppose this , and , besides , through the bushy beard , and under the shaggy , matted hair , the engineer thought he could recognize the characteristic features of the anglo - saxon .",43
"after the exhaustion of the basalt , the volcano , the power of which grew by the extinction of the lesser craters , supplied an egress to lava , ashes , and scoriae , of which i could see lengthened screes streaming down the sides of the mountain like flowing hair .",50
"this was a full - blown , very plump damsel , fair as waxwork , with handsome and regular features , languishing blue eyes , and ringleted yellow hair .",28
"cyrus harding had profited by a moment when he was sleeping , to cut his hair and matted beard , which formed a sort of mane and gave him such a savage aspect .",15
"this quadruped was a sort of pig nearly two feet and a half long , of a blackish brown color , lighter below , having hard scanty hair ; its toes , then strongly fixed in the ground , seemed to be united by a membrane .",27
"pencroft looked attentively at the plant , covered with long silky hair , the leaves being clothed with soft down .",11
"' your hair wants cutting , ' said the hatter . he had been looking at alice for some time with great curiosity , and this was his first speech .",2
"the storm increased , the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly , the thunder began to growl , and the wind , the precursor of a hurricane , whistled in the plumes and the hair of the horsemen .",34
"but the subterranean vegetation was not confined to these fungi . farther on rose groups of tall trees of colourless foliage and easy to recognise . they were lowly shrubs of earth , here attaining gigantic size ; lycopodiums , a hundred feet high ; the huge sigillaria , found in our coal mines ; tree ferns , as tall as our fir - trees in northern latitudes ; lepidodendra , with cylindrical forked stems , terminated by long leaves , and bristling with rough hairs like those of the cactus .",85
""" it seemed , sir , a woman , tall and large , with thick and dark hair hanging long down her back .",17
"these fine animals were as large as deer ; their horns were stronger than those of the ram , and their gray - colored fleece was mixed with long hair .",29
"the silken hair , too , had been suffered to grow all unheeded , and as , in its wild gossamer texture , it floated rather than fell about the face , i could not , even with effort , connect its arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity .",2
"cyrus harding had provided himself with a straight stick , twelve feet long , which he had measured as exactly as possible by comparing it with his own height , which he knew to a hair .",35
""" oh , certainly ; he is a noble of very lofty carriage , black hair , swarthy complexion , piercing eye , white teeth , and has a scar on his temple . """,15
""" a scar on his temple ! "" cried d’artagnan ; "" and with that , white teeth , a piercing eye , dark complexion , black hair , and haughty carriage -- why , that ’s my man of meung . """,27
"the yellow color of its hair was relieved by streaks and regular oblong spots of black , which contrasted with the white of its chest .",5
"the jaguar advanced and gazed around him with blazing eyes , his hair bristling as if this was not the first time he had scented men .",12
"all stopped about fifty feet from half - a - dozen animals of a large size , with strong horns bent back and flattened towards the point , with a woolly fleece , hidden under long silky hair of a tawny color .",37
she was just fastening my veil ( the plain square of blond after all ) to my hair with a brooch ; i hurried from under her hands as soon as i could .,17
"infuriated , commander farragut kept twisting the thick tuft of hair that flourished below his chin .",10
"it was but a poor boy , miserably ill - clad , a sufferer from poverty , and our aspect seemed to alarm him a great deal ; in fact , only half clothed , with ragged hair and beards , we were a suspicious - looking party ; and if the people of the country knew anything about thieves , we were very likely to frighten them .",37
"traversing the long and matted gallery , i descended the slippery steps of oak ; then i gained the hall : i halted there a minute ; i looked at some pictures on the walls ( one , i remember , represented a grim man in a cuirass , and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace ) , at a bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling , at a great clock whose case was of oak curiously carved , and ebon black with time and rubbing .",55
"an exclamation of horror broke from the painter 's lips as he saw in the dim light the hideous face on the canvas grinning at him . there was something in its expression that filled him with disgust and loathing . good heavens ! it was dorian gray 's own face that he was looking at ! the horror , whatever it was , had not yet entirely spoiled that marvellous beauty . there was still some gold in the thinning hair and some scarlet on the sensual mouth . the sodden eyes had kept something of the loveliness of their blue , the noble curves had not yet completely passed away from chiselled nostrils and from plastic throat . yes , it was dorian himself . but who had done it ? he seemed to recognize his own brushwork , and the frame was his own design . the idea was monstrous , yet he felt afraid .",81
""" never marry a woman with straw - coloured hair , dorian , "" he said after a few puffs .",9
"at these words , which left no hope , milady raised herself in all her pride , and wished to speak ; but her strength failed her . she felt that a powerful and implacable hand seized her by the hair , and dragged her away as irrevocably as fatality drags humanity . she did not , therefore , even attempt the least resistance , and went out of the cottage .",40
"but juliet ! harry , imagine a girl , hardly seventeen years of age , with a little , flowerlike face , a small greek head with plaited coils of dark - brown hair , eyes that were violet wells of passion , lips that were like the petals of a rose . she was the loveliest thing i had ever seen in my life . you said to me once that pathos left you unmoved , but that beauty , mere beauty , could fill your eyes with tears . i tell you , harry , i could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came across me .",33
""" oh , yes , horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces . """,9
""" do n't run down dyed hair and painted faces . there is an extraordinary charm in them , sometimes , "" said lord henry .",6
"it was a warm june morning , and the latter day saints were as busy as the bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem . in the fields and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry . down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavily - laden mules , all heading to the west , for the gold fever had broken out in california , and the overland route lay through the city of the elect . there , too , were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands , and trains of tired immigrants , men and horses equally weary of their interminable journey . through all this motley assemblage , threading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider , there galloped lucy ferrier , her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out behind her . she had a commission from her father in the city , and was dashing in as she had done many a time before , with all the fearlessness of youth , thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed . the travel - stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment , and even the unemotional indians , journeying in with their pelties , relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale - faced maiden .",151
"motionless against the dark tapestry , with her hair in disorder , she appeared like a horrid image of terror .",8
"in the deep shade , at the farther end of the room , a figure ran backwards and forwards . what it was , whether beast or human being , one could not , at first sight , tell : it grovelled , seemingly , on all fours ; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal : but it was covered with clothing , and a quantity of dark , grizzled hair , wild as a mane , hid its head and face .",73
"it was necessary , however , first to allow them to land , for with their close , short hair , and their fusiform conformation , being excellent swimmers , it is difficult to catch them in the sea , while on land their short , webbed feet prevent their having more than a slow , waddling movement .",19
""" yes , "" returned sir francis , "" burned alive . and , if she were not , you can not conceive what treatment she would be obliged to submit to from her relatives . they would shave off her hair , feed her on a scanty allowance of rice , treat her with contempt ; she would be looked upon as an unclean creature , and would die in some corner , like a scurvy dog . the prospect of so frightful an existence drives these poor creatures to the sacrifice much more than love or religious fanaticism . sometimes , however , the sacrifice is really voluntary , and it requires the active interference of the government to prevent it . several years ago , when i was living at bombay , a young widow asked permission of the governor to be burned along with her husband 's body ; but , as you may imagine , he refused . the woman left the town , took refuge with an independent rajah , and there carried out her self - devoted purpose .

""" do n't you scare yourself , "" he answered , drawing her to him , and passing his broad , rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair . "" we 'll fix it up somehow or another . you do n't find your fancy kind o ' lessening for this chap , do you ? """,27
""" you must have something to do with it . wait , wait a moment ; listen to me . only listen , alan . all i ask of you is to perform a certain scientific experiment . you go to hospitals and dead - houses , and the horrors that you do there do n't affect you . if in some hideous dissecting - room or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it for the blood to flow through , you would simply look upon him as an admirable subject . you would not turn a hair . you would not believe that you were doing anything wrong . on the contrary , you would probably feel that you were benefiting the human race , or increasing the sum of knowledge in the world , or gratifying intellectual curiosity , or something of that kind .",108
"and then she had such a fine head of hair ; raven - black and so becomingly arranged : a crown of thick plaits behind , and in front the longest , the glossiest curls i ever saw .",9
"there were the means of washing in the room , and a comb and brush to smooth my hair .",18
"it was only a koala , better known under the name of the sloth , being about the size of a large dog , and having stiff hair of a dirty color , the paws armed with strong claws , which enabled it to climb trees and feed on the leaves .",27
""" afterwards , take a piece of smooth ivory -- you have one prepared in your drawing - box : take your palette , mix your freshest , finest , clearest tints ; choose your most delicate camel - hair pencils ; delineate carefully the loveliest face you can imagine ; paint it in your softest shades and sweetest lines , according to the description given by mrs . fairfax of blanche ingram ; remember the raven ringlets , the oriental eye;--what ! you revert to mr . rochester as a model ! order !",39
"mrs . vane glanced at her , and with one of those false theatrical gestures that so often become a mode of second nature to a stage - player , clasped her in her arms . at this moment , the door opened and a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room . he was thick - set of figure , and his hands and feet were large and somewhat clumsy in movement . he was not so finely bred as his sister . one would hardly have guessed the close relationship that existed between them . mrs . vane fixed her eyes on him and intensified her smile . she mentally elevated her son to the dignity of an audience . she felt sure that the tableau was interesting .",50
"milady , who had arisen , threw herself quickly into the armchair , her head thrown back , her beautiful hair unbound and disheveled , her bosom half bare beneath her crumpled lace , one hand on her heart , and the other hanging down .",20

"while arranging my hair , i looked at my face in the glass , and felt it was no longer plain : there was hope in its aspect and life in its colour ; and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition , and borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple .",3
"shaking my hair from my eyes , i lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room ; at this moment a light gleamed on the wall .",2

"i felt , in bending my head toward you , your beautiful hair touch my cheek ; and every time that it touched me i trembled from head to foot . oh , queen !",12

""" there is really not much to tell , "" cried dorian as they took their seats at the small round table . "" what happened was simply this . after i left you yesterday evening , harry , i dressed , had some dinner at that little italian restaurant in rupert street you introduced me to , and went down at eight o'clock to the theatre . sibyl was playing rosalind . of course , the scenery was dreadful and the orlando absurd . but sibyl ! you should have seen her ! when she came on in her boy 's clothes , she was perfectly wonderful . she wore a moss - coloured velvet jerkin with cinnamon sleeves , slim , brown , cross - gartered hose , a dainty little green cap with a hawk 's feather caught in a jewel , and a hooded cloak lined with dull red . she had never seemed to me more exquisite . she had all the delicate grace of that tanagra figurine that you have in your studio , basil . her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round a pale rose . as for her acting -- well , you shall see her to - night . she is simply a born artist .",183

"by that plain arrangement of the hair , by that costume of extreme simplicity , by the brow polished like marble and as hard and impenetrable , she recognized one of those gloomy puritans she had so often met , not only in the court of king james , but in that of the king of france , where , in spite of the remembrance of the st . bartholomew , they sometimes came to seek refuge .",6
"for our young man had a steed which was the observed of all observers . it was a bearn pony , from twelve to fourteen years old , yellow in his hide , without a hair in his tail , but not without windgalls on his legs , which , though going with his head lower than his knees , rendering a martingale quite unnecessary , contrived nevertheless to perform his eight leagues a day .",35
"aramis mumbled verses to himself , and porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his mustache , in sign of despair .",14
