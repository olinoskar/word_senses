"i perfectly understood the necessity of abiding a particular moment of the tide to undertake the crossing of the fiord , when , the sea having reached its greatest height , it should be slack water . then the ebb and flow have no sensible effect , and the boat does not risk being carried either to the bottom or out to sea .",12,"('tide', 'marée', 'marear')",0

"the juncture was favorable . the english , who require , above everything , good living in order to be good soldiers , only eating salt meat and bad biscuit , had many invalids in their camp . still further , the sea , very rough at this period of the year all along the sea coast , destroyed every day some little vessel ; and the shore , from the point of l’aiguillon to the trenches , was at every tide literally covered with the wrecks of pinnacles , roberges , and feluccas . the result was that even if the king ’s troops remained quietly in their camp , it was evident that some day or other , buckingham , who only continued in the isle from obstinacy , would be obliged to raise the siege .",81,"('tide', 'marée', 'marear')",0
"mr . fogg left the hotel alone , after giving passepartout instructions to await his return , and inform aouda to be ready at an instant 's notice . he proceeded to the banks of the hudson , and looked about among the vessels moored or anchored in the river , for any that were about to depart . several had departure signals , and were preparing to put to sea at morning tide ; for in this immense and admirable port there is not one day in a hundred that vessels do not set out for every quarter of the globe . but they were mostly sailing vessels , of which , of course , phileas fogg could make no use .",73,"('tide', 'marée', 'marear')",0
"here is what those circumstances entailed . two miles to starboard lay gueboroa island , its coastline curving north to west like an immense arm . to the south and east , heads of coral were already on display , left uncovered by the ebbing waters . we had run aground at full tide and in one of those seas whose tides are moderate , an inconvenient state of affairs for floating the nautilus off . however , the ship had n't suffered in any way , so solidly joined was its hull . but although it could neither sink nor split open , it was in serious danger of being permanently attached to these reefs , and that would have been the finish of captain nemo 's submersible .",61,"('tide', 'marée', 'marear')",0

"the colonists were then on the shore of an unimportant little harbor , which would scarcely have contained even two or three fishing - boats . it served as a neck to the new creek , of which the curious thing was that its waters , instead of joining the sea by a gentle slope , fell from a height of more than forty feet , which explained why the rising tide was not felt up the stream .",71,"('tide', 'flot', 'marear')",3
