"this expression rather disturbed fix , without his knowing why . had the frenchman guessed his real purpose ? he knew not what to think . but how could passepartout have discovered that he was a detective ? yet , in speaking as he did , the man evidently meant more than he expressed .",1
"i permitted myself the delight of being kind to you ; kindness stirred emotion soon : your face became soft in expression , your tones gentle ; i liked my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful happy accent .",21
"now , as at the moment in which d’artagnan fixed his eyes upon the gentleman in the violet doublet , the gentleman made one of his most knowing and profound remarks respecting the bearnese pony , his two auditors laughed even louder than before , and he himself , though contrary to his custom , allowed a pale smile ( if i may allowed to use such an expression ) to stray over his countenance .",68
"this commissary was a man of very repulsive mien , with a pointed nose , with yellow and salient cheek bones , with eyes small but keen and penetrating , and an expression of countenance resembling at once the polecat and the fox .",32
"her voice , of immense power and sublime expression , gave to the rude , unpolished poetry of these psalms a magic and an effect which the most exalted puritans rarely found in the songs of their brethren , and which they were forced to ornament with all the resources of their imagination . felton believed he heard the singing of the angel who consoled the three hebrews in the furnace .",8
"his quiet manner and the ironical expression of his countenance redoubled the mirth of the persons with whom he had been talking , and who still remained at the window .",6
"when he entered , she looked at him , and an expression of infinite joy came over her . "" how badly i acted to - night , dorian ! "" she cried .",11
she looked at him with an expression of kindness which it was impossible to mistake ; but d’artagnan was so preoccupied by the mistress that he noticed absolutely nothing but her .,6
"dorian gray frowned and turned his head away . he could not help liking the tall , graceful young man who was standing by him . his romantic , olive - coloured face and worn expression interested him . there was something in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating . his cool , white , flowerlike hands , even , had a curious charm . they moved , as he spoke , like music , and seemed to have a language of their own .",35
"rance resumed his seat , without however losing his mystified expression . "" i went back to the gate and sounded my whistle . that brought murcher and two more to the spot . """,10
"the next morning , february 19 , i beheld the canadian entering my stateroom . i was expecting this visit . he wore an expression of great disappointment .",24
"captain nemo fell silent and seemed lost in reverie . i regarded him with intense excitement , silently analyzing his strange facial expression . leaning his elbow on the corner of a valuable mosaic table , he no longer saw me , he had forgotten my very presence .",22
"he was carried at once into the blue drawing - room and laid upon one of the sofas . after a short time , he came to himself and looked round with a dazed expression .",34
""" killed herself ! good heavens ! is there no doubt about that ? "" cried hallward , looking up at him with an expression of horror .",24
""" the smile is very well , "" said he , catching instantly the passing expression ; "" but speak too . """,15
"how he was on the watch for his soul , if one may use the expression !",15
"perfect beauty is a strong expression ; but i do not retrace or qualify it : as sweet features as ever the temperate clime of albion moulded ; as pure hues of rose and lily as ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened , justified , in this instance , the term .",5
"his countenance reminded one of a lamp quenched , waiting to be re - lit -- and alas ! it was not himself that could now kindle the lustre of animated expression : he was dependent on another for that office !",31
"at the bottom of the crater were three chimneys , through which , in its eruptions , snæfell had driven forth fire and lava from its central furnace . each of these chimneys was a hundred feet in diameter . they gaped before us right in our path . i had not the courage to look down either of them . but professor liedenbrock had hastily surveyed all three ; he was panting , running from one to the other , gesticulating , and uttering incoherent expressions . hans and his comrades , seated upon loose lava rocks , looked at him with as much wonder as they knew how to express , and perhaps taking him for an escaped lunatic .",86
""" what on earth is this ? "" i cried , for at this moment there came the pattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs , accompanied by audible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady .",33
"this expression sprang from the very bottom of the heart , and , like the first , there was no mistaking it .",1
""" i scarcely expected to hear that expression from you , "" he said : "" i think i have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn . """,7
"the silken hair , too , had been suffered to grow all unheeded , and as , in its wild gossamer texture , it floated rather than fell about the face , i could not , even with effort , connect its arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity .",43
"the professor stared at me over his spectacles ; no doubt he saw something unusual in the expression of my countenance ; for he laid hold of my arm , and speechlessly questioned me with his eyes . yes , never was a question more forcibly put .",17
"i sought in her countenance and features a likeness to mr . rochester , but found none : no trait , no turn of expression announced relationship .",24
the old man put on a very knowing expression .,8
the first words i pronounced were words of appreciation and gratitude to my two companions . ned and conseil had kept me alive during the final hours of our long death throes . but no expression of thanks could repay them fully for such devotion .,35
""" do stay . you have never played so well as to - night . there was something in your touch that was wonderful . it had more expression than i had ever heard from it before . """,28
"holmes had taken out his watch , and as minute followed minute without result , an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared upon his features . he gnawed his lip , drummed his fingers upon the table , and showed every other symptom of acute impatience . so great was his emotion , that i felt sincerely sorry for him , while the two detectives smiled derisively , by no means displeased at this check which he had met .",16
"hallward glanced round him with a puzzled expression . the room looked as if it had not been lived in for years . a faded flemish tapestry , a curtained picture , an old italian cassone , and an almost empty book - case -- that was all that it seemed to contain , besides a chair and a table . as dorian gray was lighting a half - burned candle that was standing on the mantelshelf , he saw that the whole place was covered with dust and that the carpet was in holes . a mouse ran scuffling behind the wainscoting . there was a damp odour of mildew .",7
""" you will not wait till he asks ; you will speak first , and tell him that i am gone on the lookout , because certain expressions of our host have given me reason to think the road is not safe . i will say two words about it to the cardinal ’s esquire likewise . the rest concerns myself ; do n’t be uneasy about that . """,27
"the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo : she succeeded in getting its body tucked away , comfortably enough , under her arm , with its legs hanging down , but generally , just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out , and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head , it would twist itself round and look up in her face , with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing : and when she had got its head down , and was going to begin again , it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself , and was in the act of crawling away : besides all this , there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to , and , as the doubled - up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground , alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed .",78
""" guess i 'll come with you on any terms , "" said ferrier , with such emphasis that the grave elders could not restrain a smile . the leader alone retained his stern , impressive expression .",36
"ten curious heads were glued to the tapestry and became pale with fury ; for their ears , closely applied to the door , did not lose a syllable of what he said , while their mouths repeated as he went on , the insulting expressions of the captain to all the people in the antechamber .",45
"i will not speak of the sufferings we endured in our return . my uncle bore them with the angry impatience of a man obliged to own his weakness ; hans with the resignation of his passive nature ; i , i confess , with complaints and expressions of despair . i had no spirit to oppose this ill fortune .",47
""" fine , ned , "" i said , then resurrected one of the canadian 's expressions . "" you expect us to fall for that ? """,16
ned looked at me with a bantering expression .,7
"passepartout was waiting for his master , armed with half a dozen six - barrelled revolvers . when he perceived fix , he knit his brows ; but aouda having , in a few words , told him of their adventure , his countenance resumed its placid expression . fix evidently was no longer an enemy , but an ally ; he was faithfully keeping his word .",47
"not a tear rose to burns ' eye ; and , while i paused from my sewing , because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment of unavailing and impotent anger , not a feature of her pensive face altered its ordinary expression .",44
"the lights inside the house had all been extinguished , and from the darkened window ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own , and which he was now about to abandon for ever . he had long nerved himself to the sacrifice , however , and the thought of the honour and happiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes . all looked so peaceful and happy , the rustling trees and the broad silent stretch of grain - land , that it was difficult to realize that the spirit of murder lurked through it all . yet the white face and set expression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head .",109
my friend leaned a little forward and his expression became intent . our visitor readjusted his glasses and began:--,8
""" no , "" answered his mother with a placid expression in her face . "" he has not yet revealed his real name . i think it is quite romantic of him . he is probably a member of the aristocracy . """,10
""" then let me have the private ones . "" he leaned back , put his finger - tips together , and assumed his most impassive and judicial expression .",28
"a long , low moan , indescribably sad , swept over the moor . it filled the whole air , and yet it was impossible to say whence it came . from a dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar , and then sank back into a melancholy , throbbing murmur once again . stapleton looked at me with a curious expression in his face .",62
"the influence to which the priests of pillaji had subjected aouda began gradually to yield , and she became more herself , so that her fine eyes resumed all their soft indian expression .",32
"felton listened without uttering any word or sound , except an inward expression of agony . the sweat streamed down his marble forehead , and his hand , under his coat , tore his breast .",12
"the man with calm , gentle eyes listened to me serenely , even courteously , and paid remarkable attention . but nothing in his facial expression indicated that he understood my story . when i finished , he did n't pronounce a single word .",25
""" that 's a strange thing , "" remarked my companion ; "" you are the second man to - day that has used that expression to me . """,25
"gregson and lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this proposition rather a bold one ; but holmes at once took the prisoner at his word , and loosened the towel which we had bound round his ancles . he rose and stretched his legs , as though to assure himself that they were free once more . i remember that i thought to myself , as i eyed him , that i had seldom seen a more powerfully built man ; and his dark sunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was as formidable as his personal strength .",89
"mary 's countenance was equally intelligent -- her features equally pretty ; but her expression was more reserved , and her manners , though gentle , more distant .",14
""" we 'll soon see , "" ned land replied , shaking his head with a determined expression .",17
""" i had a school , "" said stapleton . "" it was in the north country . the work to a man of my temperament was mechanical and uninteresting , but the privilege of living with youth , of helping to mould those young minds , and of impressing them with one 's own character and ideals , was very dear to me . however , the fates were against us . a serious epidemic broke out in the school and three of the boys died . it never recovered from the blow , and much of my capital was irretrievably swallowed up . and yet , if it were not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys , i could rejoice over my own misfortune , for , with my strong tastes for botany and zoology , i find an unlimited field of work here , and my sister is as devoted to nature as i am . all this , dr . watson , has been brought upon your head by your expression as you surveyed the moor out of our window . """,178
"i had no sympathy in their appearance , their expression : yet i could imagine that most observers would call them attractive , handsome , imposing ; while they would pronounce mr . rochester at once harsh - featured and melancholy - looking .",9
""" too much of yourself in it ! upon my word , basil , i did n't know you were so vain ; and i really ca n't see any resemblance between you , with your rugged strong face and your coal - black hair , and this young adonis , who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose - leaves . why , my dear basil , he is a narcissus , and you-- well , of course you have an intellectual expression and all that . but beauty , real beauty , ends where an intellectual expression begins . intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration , and destroys the harmony of any face . the moment one sits down to think , one becomes all nose , or all forehead , or something horrid . look at the successful men in any of the learned professions . how perfectly hideous they are ! except , of course , in the church . but then in the church they do n't think . a bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen , and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful .",87

"whether porthos understood him or did not understand him , giving way to his anger , "" monsieur , "" said he , "" you stand a chance of getting chastised if you rub musketeers in this fashion . "" "" chastised , monsieur ! "" said d’artagnan , "" the expression is strong . """,51
"i confess that i was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the practical nature of my companion 's theories . my respect for his powers of analysis increased wondrously . there still remained some lurking suspicion in my mind , however , that the whole thing was a pre - arranged episode , intended to dazzle me , though what earthly object he could have in taking me in was past my comprehension . when i looked at him he had finished reading the note , and his eyes had assumed the vacant , lack - lustre expression which showed mental abstraction .",98
""" i will tell you , "" said hallward ; but an expression of perplexity came over his face .",12
he laughed at my bewildered expression .,5
