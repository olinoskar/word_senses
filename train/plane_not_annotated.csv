""" in order to steer this boat to port or starboard , in short , to make turns on a horizontal plane , i use an ordinary , wide - bladed rudder that 's fastened to the rear of the sternpost and worked by a wheel and tackle . but i can also move the nautilus upward and downward on a vertical plane by the simple method of slanting its two fins , which are attached to its sides at its center of flotation ; these fins are flexible , able to assume any position , and can be operated from inside by means of powerful levers . if these fins stay parallel with the boat , the latter moves horizontally . if they slant , the nautilus follows the angle of that slant and , under its propeller 's thrust , either sinks on a diagonal as steep as it suits me , or rises on that diagonal . and similarly , if i want to return more swiftly to the surface , i throw the propeller in gear , and the water 's pressure makes the nautilus rise vertically , as an air balloon inflated with hydrogen lifts swiftly into the skies .
