"he and neb had surveyed the coast for a distance of eight miles and consequently much beyond the place where the balloon had fallen the last time but one , a fall which was followed by the disappearance of the engineer and the dog top .",26
"the conversation lasted some time and turned chiefly on the form of government , their manners , their women , their public diversions , and the arts . at length , candide , who had always had a taste for metaphysics , asked whether the people of that country had any religion .",4
"' you 'll get used to it in time , ' said the caterpillar ; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again .",8
"it only needed care and attention , as they had plenty of wood and could renew their store at any time .",20
"' a likely story indeed ! ' said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt . ' i 've seen a good many little girls in my time , but never one with such a neck as that ! no , no ! you 're a serpent ; and there 's no use denying it . i suppose you 'll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg ! '",29
"dear m. d’artagnan , it is wrong thus to neglect your friends , particularly at the moment you are about to leave them for so long a time .",27
"candide , however , had one advantage over martin : he lived in the pleasing hopes of seeing miss cunegund once more ; whereas , the poor philosopher had nothing to hope for . besides , candide had money and jewels , and , not withstanding he had lost a hundred red sheep laden with the greatest treasure outside of el dorado , and though he still smarted from the reflection of the dutch skipper 's knavery , yet when he considered what he had still left , and repeated the name of cunegund , especially after meal times , he inclined to pangloss 's doctrine .",98
""" then , "" replied he , "" my visit is ill - timed ; you , no doubt , stand in need of repose , and i will withdraw . """,13
""" i remember , "" said martin to him , "" that the first time i came to paris i was likewise taken ill . i was very poor , and accordingly i had neither friends , nurses , nor physicians , and yet i did very well . """,14
"' all right , ' said the cat ; and this time it vanished quite slowly , beginning with the end of the tail , and ending with the grin , which remained some time after the rest of it had gone .",34
"' your hair wants cutting , ' said the hatter . he had been looking at alice for some time with great curiosity , and this was his first speech .",19
""" well , "" replied milady , after a moment of silence , "" from the present time , cease to talk of impossibilities . """,17
"' of course not , ' alice replied very readily : ' but that 's because it stays the same year for such a long time together . '",25
"' perhaps not , ' alice cautiously replied : ' but i know i have to beat time when i learn music . '",17
""" there , "" said he , "" are the two suspected foreigners . "" at the same time he ordered them to be seized and carried to prison .",18
"' yes , that 's it , ' said the hatter with a sigh : ' it 's always tea - time , and we 've no time to wash the things between whiles . '",21
"' treacle , ' said the dormouse , without considering at all this time .",13
""" it is strange , "" said he to martin , "" very strange that i should have time to sail from surinam to bordeaux ; to travel thence to paris , to dieppe , to portsmouth ; to sail along the coast of portugal and spain , and up the mediterranean to spend some months at venice ; and that my lovely cunegund should not have arrived . instead of her , i only met with a parisian impostor , and a rascally abbe of perigord .",18
"friar giroflee was all this time in the parlor refreshing himself with a glass or two of wine till dinner was ready . "" but , "" said candide to pacquette , "" you looked so gay and contented , when i met you , you sang and caressed the theatin with so much fondness , that i absolutely thought you as happy as you say you are now miserable .

"by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back , the fight was over , and both the hedgehogs were out of sight : ' but it does n't matter much , ' thought alice , ' as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground . ' so she tucked it away under her arm , that it might not escape again , and went back for a little more conversation with her friend .",2
"the executioner 's argument was , that you could n't cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from : that he had never had to do such a thing before , and he was n't going to begin at his time of life .",46
"the queen 's argument was , that if something was n't done about it in less than no time she 'd have everybody executed , all round . ( it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious . )",18
"the cat 's head began fading away the moment he was gone , and , by the time he had come back with the duchess , it had entirely disappeared ; so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it , while the rest of the party went back to the game .",17
"she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time , and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear . ' you 're thinking about something , my dear , and that makes you forget to talk . i ca n't tell you just now what the moral of that is , but i shall remember it in a bit . '",8
"' now , i give you fair warning , ' shouted the queen , stamping on the ground as she spoke ; ' either you or your head must be off , and that in about half no time ! take your choice ! '",38
"all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling with the other players , and shouting ' off with his head ! ' or ' off with her head ! ' those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers , who of course had to leave off being arches to do this , so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left , and all the players , except the king , the queen , and alice , were in custody and under sentence of execution .",2
"the other five kings listened to this speech with great attention ; it excited their compassion ; each of them made the unhappy theodore a present of twenty sequins , and candide gave him a diamond , worth just a hundred times that sum .",41
"in a few days they reached the bosphorus ; and the first thing candide did was to pay a high ransom for cacambo ; then , without losing time , he and his companions went on board a galley , in order to search for his cunegund on the banks of the propontis , notwithstanding she was grown so ugly .",28
it was time .,2
"' that generally takes some time , ' interrupted the gryphon .",5
"this neb knew , and he wished to see his master again for the last time .",15
"' back to land again , and that 's all the first figure , ' said the mock turtle , suddenly dropping his voice ; and the two creatures , who had been jumping about like mad things all this time , sat down again very sadly and quietly , and looked at alice .",40
"so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice , every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close , and waving their forepaws to mark the time , while the mock turtle sang this , very slowly and sadly :",31
"at length the portuguese barber took courage , sewed up my wound , and his wife nursed me ; and i was upon my legs in a fortnight 's time .",29
""" bother the continent , "" cried pencroft hastily ; "" there is time enough to see about that , captain ! we do n't care for anything , provided you are living . """,13
"the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived , with a great crowd assembled about them -- all sorts of little birds and beasts , as well as the whole pack of cards : the knave was standing before them , in chains , with a soldier on each side to guard him ; and near the king was the white rabbit , with a trumpet in one hand , and a scroll of parchment in the other . in the very middle of the court was a table , with a large dish of tarts upon it : they looked so good , that it made alice quite hungry to look at them--'i wish they 'd get the trial done , ' she thought , ' and hand round the refreshments ! ' but there seemed to be no chance of this , so she began looking at everything about her , to pass away the time .",163
"in the centre of the room , clamped to an upright easel , stood the full - length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty , and in front of it , some little distance away , was sitting the artist himself , basil hallward , whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused , at the time , such public excitement and gave rise to so many strange conjectures .",58
"for some minutes the whole court was in confusion , getting the dormouse turned out , and , by the time they had settled down again , the cook had disappeared .",20
"at half - past five the little band arrived at the precipice , and a short time after at the chimneys .",16
"after a pause , lord henry pulled out his watch . "" i am afraid i must be going , basil , "" he murmured , "" and before i go , i insist on your answering a question i put to you some time ago . """,44
""" the story is simply this , "" said the painter after some time . "" two months ago i went to a crush at lady brandon 's . you know we poor artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time , just to remind the public that we are not savages . with an evening coat and a white tie , as you told me once , anybody , even a stock - broker , can gain a reputation for being civilized .",43
