"mr . phileas fogg lived , in 1872 , at no . 7 , saville row , burlington gardens , the house in which sheridan died in 1814 . he was one of the most noticeable members of the reform club , though he seemed always to avoid attracting attention ; an enigmatical personage , about whom little was known , except that he was a polished man of the world . people said that he resembled byron -- at least that his head was byronic ; but he was a bearded , tranquil byron , who might live on a thousand years without growing old .",44
"milady knew she might be watched , so she continued her prayers to the end ; and it appeared to her that the soldier who was on duty at her door did not march with the same step , and seemed to listen .",40
"was phileas fogg rich ? undoubtedly . but those who knew him best could not imagine how he had made his fortune , and mr . fogg was the last person to whom to apply for the information . he was not lavish , nor , on the contrary , avaricious ; for , whenever he knew that money was needed for a noble , useful , or benevolent purpose , he supplied it quietly and sometimes anonymously . he was , in short , the least communicative of men . he talked very little , and seemed all the more mysterious for his taciturn manner . his daily habits were quite open to observation ; but whatever he did was so exactly the same thing that he had always done before , that the wits of the curious were fairly puzzled .",97
"had he travelled ? it was likely , for no one seemed to know the world more familiarly ; there was no spot so secluded that he did not appear to have an intimate acquaintance with it . he often corrected , with a few clear words , the thousand conjectures advanced by members of the club as to lost and unheard - of travellers , pointing out the true probabilities , and seeming as if gifted with a sort of second sight , so often did events justify his predictions . he must have travelled everywhere , at least in the spirit .",11

"some of these wrecked ships had perished in collisions , others from hitting granite reefs . i saw a few that had sunk straight down , their masting still upright , their rigging stiffened by the water . they looked like they were at anchor by some immense , open , offshore mooring where they were waiting for their departure time . when the nautilus passed between them , covering them with sheets of electricity , they seemed ready to salute us with their colors and send us their serial numbers ! but no , nothing but silence and death filled this field of catastrophes !",77
""" i am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the moor . if that were so , and it seems most probable , only a man who had lost his wits would have run from the house instead of towards it . if the gipsy 's evidence may be taken as true , he ran with cries for help in the direction where help was least likely to be . then , again , whom was he waiting for that night , and why was he waiting for him in the yew alley rather than in his own house ?

"in fact , m. bonacieux , having left his house at seven o’clock in the evening to go to the louvre , never appeared again in the rue des fossoyeurs ; the opinion of those who seemed to be best informed was that he was fed and lodged in some royal castle , at the expense of his generous eminence .",36
"there was a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy , and the blue cloud - shadows chased themselves across the grass like swallows . how pleasant it was in the garden ! and how delightful other people 's emotions were!-- much more delightful than their ideas , it seemed to him . one 's own soul , and the passions of one 's friends -- those were the fascinating things in life . he pictured to himself with silent amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long with basil hallward .",54
""" who is this ? who is this ? "" he demanded , trying , as it seemed , to _ see _ with those sightless eyes -- unavailing and distressing attempt !",17
"the relevant data on this apparition , as recorded in various logbooks , agreed pretty closely as to the structure of the object or creature in question , its unprecedented speed of movement , its startling locomotive power , and the unique vitality with which it seemed to be gifted . if it was a cetacean , it exceeded in bulk any whale previously classified by science . no naturalist , neither cuvier nor lacépède , neither professor dumeril nor professor de quatrefages , would have accepted the existence of such a monster sight unseen-- specifically , unseen by their own scientific eyes .",46
"first , she dreamed of little alice herself , and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee , and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers -- she could hear the very tones of her voice , and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes -- and still as she listened , or seemed to listen , the whole place around her became alive the strange creatures of her little sister 's dream .",72
"has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough , vigorous enough , to hold the swelling spring of pure , full , fervid eloquence ? such was the characteristic of helen 's discourse on that , to me , memorable evening ; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence .",45
""" hum ! someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements .

"now , i entertain a ridiculous partiality for my head , it seems to suit my shoulders so correctly .",12
he suddenly seemed to arouse himself : the conviction of the reality of all this seized him .,2
"for nearly ten minutes he stood there , motionless , with parted lips and eyes strangely bright . he was dimly conscious that entirely fresh influences were at work within him . yet they seemed to him to have come really from himself . the few words that basil 's friend had said to him -- words spoken by chance , no doubt , and with wilful paradox in them-- had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before , but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses .",34
"music had stirred him like that . music had troubled him many times . but music was not articulate . it was not a new world , but rather another chaos , that it created in us . words ! mere words ! how terrible they were ! how clear , and vivid , and cruel ! one could not escape from them . and yet what a subtle magic there was in them ! they seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things , and to have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute . mere words ! was there anything so real as words ?",76
yes ; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood . he understood them now . life suddenly became fiery - coloured to him . it seemed to him that he had been walking in fire . why had he not known it ?,30
he replied not : he seemed serious -- abstracted ; he sighed ; he half - opened his lips as if to speak : he closed them again .,5

"around the nautilus for a half - mile radius , the waters seemed saturated with electric light . the sandy bottom was clear and bright . dressed in diving suits , crewmen were busy clearing away half - rotted barrels and disemboweled trunks in the midst of the dingy hulks of ships . out of these trunks and kegs spilled ingots of gold and silver , cascades of jewels , pieces of eight . the sand was heaped with them . then , laden with these valuable spoils , the men returned to the nautilus , dropped off their burdens inside , and went to resume this inexhaustible fishing for silver and gold .",12
"runic letters appearing to my mind to be an invention of the learned to mystify this poor world , i was not sorry to see my uncle suffering the pangs of mystification . at least , so it seemed to me , judging from his fingers , which were beginning to work with terrible energy .",38

"dorian gray frowned and turned his head away . he could not help liking the tall , graceful young man who was standing by him . his romantic , olive - coloured face and worn expression interested him . there was something in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating . his cool , white , flowerlike hands , even , had a curious charm . they moved , as he spoke , like music , and seemed to have a language of their own .",78
"but he felt afraid of him , and ashamed of being afraid . why had it been left for a stranger to reveal him to himself ? he had known basil hallward for months , but the friendship between them had never altered him . suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to have disclosed to him life 's mystery . and , yet , what was there to be afraid of ? he was not a schoolboy or a girl . it was absurd to be frightened .",55

"in an hour we had reached the islet . two hours later we had completed a full circle around it . it measured four to five miles in circumference . a narrow channel separated it from a considerable shore , perhaps a continent whose limits we could n't see . the existence of this shore seemed to bear out commander maury 's hypotheses . in essence , this ingenious american has noted that between the south pole and the 60th parallel , the sea is covered with floating ice of dimensions much greater than any found in the north atlantic . from this fact he drew the conclusion that the antarctic circle must contain considerable shores , since icebergs ca n't form on the high seas but only along coastlines . according to his calculations , this frozen mass enclosing the southernmost pole forms a vast ice cap whose width must reach 4,000 kilometers .",55

"on saturday , at six , we started afresh . in twenty minutes we reached a vast open space ; i then knew that the hand of man had not hollowed out this mine ; the vaults would have been shored up , and , as it was , they seemed to be held up by a miracle of equilibrium .",50

"he had not proceeded two hundred steps , however , when , "" by the greatest chance in the world , "" he met fix . the detective seemed wholly taken by surprise . what ! had mr . fogg and himself crossed the pacific together , and not met on the steamer ! at least fix felt honoured to behold once more the gentleman to whom he owed so much , and , as his business recalled him to europe , he should be delighted to continue the journey in such pleasant company .",28

"in fact , it was music that had first brought him and dorian gray together -- music and that indefinable attraction that dorian seemed to be able to exercise whenever he wished-- and , indeed , exercised often without being conscious of it . they had met at lady berkshire 's the night that rubinstein played there , and after that used to be always seen together at the opera and wherever good music was going on . for eighteen months their intimacy lasted . campbell was always either at selby royal or in grosvenor square .",23

"the guide watched this scene with his usual phlegmatic unconcern . yet he understood perfectly well what was going on between his two companions . the gestures themselves were sufficient to show that we were each bent on taking a different road ; but hans seemed to take no part in a question upon which depended his life . he was ready to start at a given signal , or to stay , if his master so willed it .",45

"having breakfasted , mr . fogg and his companions resumed their places in the car , and observed the varied landscape which unfolded itself as they passed along the vast prairies , the mountains lining the horizon , and the creeks , with their frothy , foaming streams . sometimes a great herd of buffaloes , massing together in the distance , seemed like a moveable dam . these innumerable multitudes of ruminating beasts often form an insurmountable obstacle to the passage of the trains ; thousands of them have been seen passing over the track for hours together , in compact ranks . the locomotive is then forced to stop and wait till the road is once more clear .",62
"a groan broke from campbell 's lips and he shivered all over . the ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece seemed to him to be dividing time into separate atoms of agony , each of which was too terrible to be borne . he felt as if an iron ring was being slowly tightened round his forehead , as if the disgrace with which he was threatened had already come upon him . the hand upon his shoulder weighed like a hand of lead . it was intolerable . it seemed to crush him .",21

"passepartout , about nine o'clock , went out upon the platform to take the air . the weather was cold , the heavens grey , but it was not snowing . the sun 's disc , enlarged by the mist , seemed an enormous ring of gold , and passepartout was amusing himself by calculating its value in pounds sterling , when he was diverted from this interesting study by a strange - looking personage who made his appearance on the platform .",41

"what rage then drove us against these monsters ! we lost all self - control . ten or twelve devilfish had overrun the nautilus 's platform and sides . we piled helter - skelter into the thick of these sawed - off snakes , which darted over the platform amid waves of blood and sepia ink . it seemed as if these viscous tentacles grew back like the many heads of hydra . at every thrust ned land 's harpoon would plunge into a squid 's sea - green eye and burst it . but my daring companion was suddenly toppled by the tentacles of a monster he could not avoid .",58
"we had above us a league and a half of terrestrial crust . the weight of it seemed to be crushing down upon my shoulders . i felt weighed down , and i exhausted myself with imaginary violent exertions to turn round upon my granite couch .",17
"what was that loathsome red dew that gleamed , wet and glistening , on one of the hands , as though the canvas had sweated blood ? how horrible it was!--more horrible , it seemed to him for the moment , than the silent thing that he knew was stretched across the table , the thing whose grotesque misshapen shadow on the spotted carpet showed him that it had not stirred , but was still there , as he had left it .",34

"was there any means of detaining mr . fogg in the car , to avoid a meeting between him and the colonel ? it ought not to be a difficult task , since that gentleman was naturally sedentary and little curious . the detective , at least , seemed to have found a way ; for , after a few moments , he said to mr . fogg , "" these are long and slow hours , sir , that we are passing on the railway .

"yes ; who but he ? such an expedient , however simple , would never have entered into our minds . true , it seemed most hazardous to strike a blow of the hammer in this part of the earth 's structure . suppose some displacement should occur and crush us all ! suppose the torrent , bursting through , should drown us in a sudden flood ! there was nothing vain in these fancies . but still no fears of falling rocks or rushing floods could stay us now ; and our thirst was so intense that , to satisfy it , we would have dared the waves of the north atlantic .",24

""" what ! prudent ! "" cried colonel proctor , whom this word seemed to excite prodigiously . "" at full speed , do n't you see , at full speed ! """,13
"holmes said little more , but the picture of the old roysterer seemed to have a fascination for him , and his eyes were continually fixed upon it during supper . it was not until later , when sir henry had gone to his room , that i was able to follow the trend of his thoughts . he led me back into the banqueting - hall , his bedroom candle in his hand , and he held it up against the time - stained portrait on the wall .",12
"how long i was sunk in this torpor i can not estimate ; but when i awoke , it seemed as if the sun were settling toward the horizon . captain nemo was already up , and i had started to stretch my limbs , when an unexpected apparition brought me sharply to my feet .",19

"on thursday , at 8 a.m. , we started afresh . the granite tunnel winding from side to side , earned us past unexpected turns , and seemed almost to form a labyrinth ; but , on the whole , its direction seemed to be south - easterly . my uncle never ceased to consult his compass , to keep account of the ground gone over .",27

"the gallery dipped down a very little way from the horizontal , scarcely more than two inches in a fathom , and the stream ran gently murmuring at our feet . i compared it to a friendly genius guiding us underground , and caressed with my hand the soft naiad , whose comforting voice accompanied our steps . with my reviving spirits these mythological notions seemed to come unbidden .",65
"this incident did not interrupt our walk . for two hours we were sometimes led over plains of sand , sometimes over prairies of seaweed that were quite arduous to cross . in all honesty , i was dead tired by the time i spotted a hazy glow half a mile away , cutting through the darkness of the waters . it was the nautilus 's beacon . within twenty minutes we would be on board , and there i could breathe easy again -- because my tank 's current air supply seemed to be quite low in oxygen . but i was reckoning without an encounter that slightly delayed our arrival .",92
d’artagnan alone did not seem convinced .,4
"there were but eight ; yet , somehow , as they flocked in , they gave the impression of a much larger number . some of them were very tall ; many were dressed in white ; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon .",46
"they dispersed about the room , reminding me , by the lightness and buoyancy of their movements , of a flock of white plumy birds . some of them threw themselves in half - reclining positions on the sofas and ottomans : some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books : the rest gathered in a group round the fire : all talked in a low but clear tone which seemed habitual to them .",73
"i was marveling at this magnificent ocean view when captain nemo appeared . he did n't seem to notice my presence and began a series of astronomical observations . then , his operations finished , he went and leaned his elbows on the beacon housing , his eyes straying over the surface of the ocean .",16
"the way seemed interminable , and the streets like the black web of some sprawling spider . the monotony became unbearable , and as the mist thickened , he felt afraid .",2
"i speak particularly of the young ladies . st . john 's eyes , though clear enough in a literal sense , in a figurative one were difficult to fathom . he seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people 's thoughts , than as agents to reveal his own : the which combination of keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than to encourage .",32
"the dog bounded towards his master , seeming to be very uneasy , and then rushed again towards the bank .",7
"dorian winced and looked round at the grotesque things that lay in such fantastic postures on the ragged mattresses . the twisted limbs , the gaping mouths , the staring lustreless eyes , fascinated him . he knew in what strange heavens they were suffering , and what dull hells were teaching them the secret of some new joy . they were better off than he was . he was prisoned in thought . memory , like a horrible malady , was eating his soul away . from time to time he seemed to see the eyes of basil hallward looking at him . yet he felt he could not stay . the presence of adrian singleton troubled him . he wanted to be where no one would know who he was . he wanted to escape from himself .",92
"lord ingram , like his sisters , is very tall ; like them , also , he is handsome ; but he shares mary 's apathetic and listless look : he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of blood or vigour of brain .",31
"he was talking , at the moment , to louisa and amy eshton . i wondered to see them receive with calm that look which seemed to me so penetrating : i expected their eyes to fall , their colour to rise under it ; yet i was glad when i found they were in no sense moved .",25
"the nautilus 's general heading was southeast , and it stayed at a depth between 100 and 150 meters . however , from lord - knows - what whim , one day it did a diagonal dive by means of its slanting fins , reaching strata located 2,000 meters underwater . the thermometer indicated a temperature of 4.25 degrees centigrade , which at this depth seemed to be a temperature common to all latitudes .",65
"his plan of campaign was beginning to be evident . he would use the baronet in order to convince the stapletons that we were really gone , while we should actually return at the instant when we were likely to be needed . that telegram from london , if mentioned by sir henry to the stapletons , must remove the last suspicions from their minds . already i seemed to see our nets drawing closer around that lean - jawed pike .",68
"henry lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the feet of louisa : adele shares it with him : he is trying to talk french with her , and louisa laughs at his blunders . with whom will blanche ingram pair ? she is standing alone at the table , bending gracefully over an album . she seems waiting to be sought ; but she will not wait too long : she herself selects a mate .",58

"dim and wavering as was the wind - blown light , yet it served to show him the hideous error , as it seemed , into which he had fallen , for the face of the man he had sought to kill had all the bloom of boyhood , all the unstained purity of youth . he seemed little more than a lad of twenty summers , hardly older , if older indeed at all , than his sister had been when they had parted so many years ago . it was obvious that this was not the man who had destroyed her life .",23

"no weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions : rain or fair , he would , when his hours of morning study were over , take his hat , and , followed by his father 's old pointer , carlo , go out on his mission of love or duty -- i scarcely know in which light he regarded it .",2
"but besides his frequent absences , there was another barrier to friendship with him : he seemed of a reserved , an abstracted , and even of a brooding nature .",16
"she appeared to be on her high horse to - night ; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite not only the admiration , but the amazement of her auditors : she was evidently bent on striking them as something very dashing and daring indeed .",18
"in the northeast there emerged two volcanic islands of unequal size , surrounded by a coral reef whose circuit measured forty miles . we were facing the island of vanikoro proper , to which captain dumont d'urville had given the name "" island of the search "" ; we lay right in front of the little harbor of vana , located in latitude 16 degrees 4 ' south and longitude 164 degrees 32 ' east . its shores seemed covered with greenery from its beaches to its summits inland , crowned by mt . kapogo , which is 476 fathoms high .",78
"so reasoned the detective , while the hours crept by all too slowly . he did not know what to do . sometimes he was tempted to tell aouda all ; but he could not doubt how the young woman would receive his confidences . what course should he take ? he thought of pursuing fogg across the vast white plains ; it did not seem impossible that he might overtake him . footsteps were easily printed on the snow ! but soon , under a new sheet , every imprint would be effaced .",65
he again paused : there seemed a reluctance to continue .,5
"he looked at me before he proceeded : indeed , he seemed leisurely to read my face , as if its features and lines were characters on a page .",11
"on the 23rd , several officers circled the island and brought back some rubble of little importance . the natives , adopting a system of denial and evasion , refused to guide them to the site of the casualty . this rather shady conduct aroused the suspicion that the natives had mistreated the castaways ; and in truth , the natives seemed afraid that dumont d'urville had come to avenge the count de la pérouse and his unfortunate companions .",61
"i answered-- "" i did not wish to disturb you , as you seemed engaged , sir . """,13
mechanically i swept the ground with my hands . how dry and hard the rock seemed to me !,15
lost at an immeasurable depth ! thirty leagues of rock seemed to weigh upon my shoulders with a dreadful pressure . i felt crushed .,10
at times it almost seemed as if an under - current raised these monstrous billows which thundered against the wall of granite house .,4
"at three o'clock in the morning , full of uneasiness , i climbed onto the platform . captain nemo had n't left it . he stood in the bow next to his flag , which a mild breeze was unfurling above his head . his eyes never left that vessel . the extraordinary intensity of his gaze seemed to attract it , beguile it , and draw it more surely than if he had it in tow !",57
"all sad feelings seemed now driven from the house , all gloomy associations forgotten : there was life everywhere , movement all day long . you could not now traverse the gallery , once so hushed , nor enter the front chambers , once so tenantless , without encountering a smart lady's - maid or a dandy valet .",3
"i stood there until six o'clock in the morning , captain nemo never seeming to notice me . the vessel lay a mile and a half off , and with the first glimmers of daylight , it resumed its cannonade . the time could n't be far away when the nautilus would attack its adversary , and my companions and i would leave forever this man i dared not judge .",13
"one of the gentlemen , mr . eshton , observing me , seemed to propose that i should be asked to join them ; but lady ingram instantly negatived the notion .",12
"suddenly my ear , resting by chance against the wall , caught , or seemed to catch , certain vague , indescribable , distant , articulate sounds , as of words .",14
why did he utter such strange barks when a sort of uneasiness seemed to draw him towards this well ?,12
"the prairie , across which the sledge was moving in a straight line , was as flat as a sea . it seemed like a vast frozen lake . the railroad which ran through this section ascended from the south - west to the north - west by great island , columbus , an important nebraska town , schuyler , and fremont , to omaha . it followed throughout the right bank of the platte river . the sledge , shortening this route , took a chord of the arc described by the railway . mudge was not afraid of being stopped by the platte river , because it was frozen . the road , then , was quite clear of obstacles , and phileas fogg had but two things to fear -- an accident to the sledge , and a change or calm in the wind .",22
"i again began to listen . passing my ear over the wall from one place to another , i found the point where the voices seemed to be best heard . the word ' _ forlorad _ ' again returned ; then the rolling of thunder which had roused me from my lethargy .",25
"at that moment a little accident supervened , which seemed decreed by fate purposely to prove the truth of the adage , that "" misfortunes never come singly , "" and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip between the cup and the lip .",9
"the situation was indeed dangerous , but as if by magic , the nautilus seemed to glide right down the middle of these rampaging reefs . it did n't follow the exact course of the zealous and the new astrolabe , which had proved so ill - fated for captain dumont d'urville . it went more to the north , hugged the murray islands , and returned to the southwest near cumberland passage . i thought it was about to charge wholeheartedly into this opening , but it went up to the northwest , through a large number of little - known islands and islets , and steered toward tound island and the bad channel .",14
"the china , in leaving , seemed to have carried off phileas fogg 's last hope .",6
both the sisters seemed struck : not shocked or appalled ; the tidings appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting .,3
"i waited with the deepest anxiety . sound does not travel with great velocity . even increased density air has no effect upon its rate of travelling ; it merely augments its intensity . seconds , which seemed ages , passed away , and at last these words reached me :",37
"he seemed about to give up all hope , when he espied , anchored at the battery , a cable 's length off at most , a trading vessel , with a screw , well - shaped , whose funnel , puffing a cloud of smoke , indicated that she was getting ready for departure .",1
"from that day forward , who knows where the nautilus took us in the north atlantic basin ? always at incalculable speed ! always amid the high arctic mists ! did it call at the capes of spitzbergen or the shores of novaya zemlya ? did it visit such uncharted seas as the white sea , the kara sea , the gulf of ob , the lyakhov islands , or those unknown beaches on the siberian coast ? i 'm unable to say . i lost track of the passing hours . time was in abeyance on the ship 's clocks . as happens in the polar regions , it seemed that night and day no longer followed their normal sequence . i felt myself being drawn into that strange domain where the overwrought imagination of edgar allan poe was at home . like his fabled arthur gordon pym , i expected any moment to see that "" shrouded human figure , very far larger in its proportions than any dweller among men , "" thrown across the cataract that protects the outskirts of the pole !",110
""" even so , captain nemo , "" i went on , ignoring his ironic turn of phrase , "" the nautilus has run aground at a moment when the sea is full . now then , the tides are n't strong in the pacific , and if you ca n't unballast the nautilus , which seems impossible to me , i do n't see how it will float off .

"sometimes all , as with one consent , suspended their by - play to observe and listen to the principal actors : for , after all , mr . rochester and -- because closely connected with him -- miss ingram were the life and soul of the party . if he was absent from the room an hour , a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the spirits of his guests ; and his re - entrance was sure to give a fresh impulse to the vivacity of conversation .",62

after the soup the maid brought a boiled fowl -- a piece of magnificence which caused the eyes of the diners to dilate in such a manner that they seemed ready to burst .,29
"even so , ten o'clock was about to strike . it was time to leave my stateroom and rejoin my companions . i dared not hesitate , even if captain nemo stood before me . i opened the door cautiously , but as it swung on its hinges , it seemed to make a frightful noise . this noise existed , perhaps , only in my imagination !",50
"still , some means must be found to cross the atlantic on a boat , unless by balloon -- which would have been venturesome , besides not being capable of being put in practice . it seemed that phileas fogg had an idea , for he said to the captain ,",36

"the next day he did not leave the house , and , indeed , spent most of the time in his own room , sick with a wild terror of dying , and yet indifferent to life itself . the consciousness of being hunted , snared , tracked down , had begun to dominate him . if the tapestry did but tremble in the wind , he shook . the dead leaves that were blown against the leaded panes seemed to him like his own wasted resolutions and wild regrets . when he closed his eyes , he saw again the sailor 's face peering through the mist- stained glass , and horror seemed once more to lay its hand upon his heart .",79

"the door led right into a large kitchen , which was full of smoke from one end to the other : the duchess was sitting on a three - legged stool in the middle , nursing a baby ; the cook was leaning over the fire , stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup .",52

"alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook , to see if she meant to take the hint ; but the cook was busily stirring the soup , and seemed not to be listening , so she went on again : ' twenty - four hours , i think ; or is it twelve ? i-- '",28
"eliza 's greeting was delivered in a short , abrupt voice , without a smile ; and then she sat down again , fixed her eyes on the fire , and seemed to forget me .",31
"the result was that , thanks to these attentions , the stranger resumed a more human appearance , and it even seemed as if his eyes had become milder .",21
"we were silent . what was captain nemo thinking ? perhaps that this approaching shore was too close for comfort , contrary to the canadian 's views in which it still seemed too far away . as for conseil , he had come along out of simple curiosity .",31

"just then a huge cave opened up in our path , hollowed from a picturesque pile of rocks whose smooth heights were completely hung with underwater flora . at first this cave looked pitch - black to me . inside , the sun 's rays seemed to diminish by degrees . their hazy transparency was nothing more than drowned light .",45

"something of vengeance i had tasted for the first time ; as aromatic wine it seemed , on swallowing , warm and racy : its after - flavour , metallic and corroding , gave me a sensation as if i had been poisoned .",15
"i observed him with great care . his movements were systematically executed , and for half an hour no danger seemed to threaten him . so i had gotten used to the sight of this fascinating fishing when all at once , just as the indian was kneeling on the seafloor , i saw him make a frightened gesture , stand , and gather himself to spring back to the surface of the waves . i understood his fear . a gigantic shadow appeared above the poor diver . it was a shark of huge size , moving in diagonally , eyes ablaze , jaws wide open !",20
"bessie 's presence , compared with the thoughts over which i had been brooding , seemed cheerful ; even though , as usual , she was somewhat cross .",15
they both seemed surprised at my skill .,2
"the communications were renewed from day to day : they always ran on the same theme -- herself , her loves , and woes . it was strange she never once adverted either to her mother 's illness , or her brother 's death , or the present gloomy state of the family prospects . her mind seemed wholly taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety , and aspirations after dissipations to come .",57
"she passed about five minutes each day in her mother 's sick - room , and no more . eliza still spoke little : she had evidently no time to talk . i never saw a busier person than she seemed to be ; yet it was difficult to say what she did : or rather , to discover any result of her diligence .",40

"nevertheless , when the name of the king was now and then uttered unthinkingly amid all these cardinal jests , a sort of gag seemed to close for a moment on all these jeering mouths . they looked hesitatingly around them , and appeared to doubt the thickness of the partition between them and the office of m. de treville ; but a fresh allusion soon brought back the conversation to his eminence , and then the laughter recovered its loudness and the light was not withheld from any of his actions .",24
"for four days until february 3 , the nautilus inspected the gulf of oman at various speeds and depths . it seemed to be traveling at random , as if hesitating over which course to follow , but it never crossed the tropic of cancer .",21

"mrs . fairfax surmised that he was gone to make arrangements for his wedding , as he had talked of purchasing a new carriage : she said the idea of his marrying miss ingram still seemed strange to her ; but from what everybody said , and from what she had herself seen , she could no longer doubt that the event would shortly take place .",35

""" nor that either , "" he answered . "" this is no northern mountain ; here are no granite peaks capped with snow . look , axel , look ! "" above our heads , at a height of five hundred feet or more , we saw the crater of a volcano , through which , at intervals of fifteen minutes or so , there issued with loud explosions lofty columns of fire , mingled with pumice stones , ashes , and flowing lava . i could feel the heaving of the mountain , which seemed to breathe like a huge whale , and puff out fire and wind from its vast blowholes . beneath , down a pretty steep declivity , ran streams of lava for eight or nine hundred feet , giving the mountain a height of about 1,300 or 1,400 feet . but the base of the mountain was hidden in a perfect bower of rich verdure , amongst which i was able to distinguish the olive , the fig , and vines , covered with their luscious purple bunches .",96
porthos seemed to breathe more freely .,1
"it was but a poor boy , miserably ill - clad , a sufferer from poverty , and our aspect seemed to alarm him a great deal ; in fact , only half clothed , with ragged hair and beards , we were a suspicious - looking party ; and if the people of the country knew anything about thieves , we were very likely to frighten them .",20
his last words were balm : they seemed to imply that it imported something to him whether i forgot him or not . and he had spoken of thornfield as my home -- would that it were my home !,7

"at six o'clock , sometimes afloat and sometimes submerged , the nautilus passed well out from el tur , which sat at the far end of a bay whose waters seemed to be dyed red , as captain nemo had already mentioned . then night fell in the midst of a heavy silence occasionally broken by the calls of pelicans and nocturnal birds , by the sound of surf chafing against rocks , or by the distant moan of a steamer churning the waves of the gulf with noisy blades .",30

"that 's how we ended this conversation , which later was to have such serious consequences . at first , i must say , events seemed to confirm my forecasts , much to the canadian 's despair . did captain nemo view us with distrust in these heavily traveled seas , or did he simply want to hide from the sight of those ships of every nation that plowed the mediterranean ? i have no idea , but usually he stayed in midwater and well out from any coast . either the nautilus surfaced only enough to let its pilothouse emerge , or it slipped away to the lower depths , although , between the greek islands and asia minor , we did n't find bottom even at 2,000 meters down .",25

"from the corner of the divan of persian saddle - bags on which he was lying , smoking , as was his custom , innumerable cigarettes , lord henry wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey - sweet and honey- coloured blossoms of a laburnum , whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs ; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore - silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window , producing a kind of momentary japanese effect , and making him think of those pallid , jade - faced painters of tokio who , through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile , seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion .",51
