"the vast liquid plain , lashed without mercy by the storm , appeared as if covered with herds of furious chargers , whose white and disheveled crests were streaming in the wind .",1
"one might have said that at this distance she had already entered the vast bay , for a straight line drawn from claw cape to cape mandible would have rested on her starboard quarter .",13
"so reasoned the detective , while the hours crept by all too slowly . he did not know what to do . sometimes he was tempted to tell aouda all ; but he could not doubt how the young woman would receive his confidences . what course should he take ? he thought of pursuing fogg across the vast white plains ; it did not seem impossible that he might overtake him . footsteps were easily printed on the snow ! but soon , under a new sheet , every imprint would be effaced .",58
"and i believe that centuries succeeding to centuries , and insects to insects , this pacific may one day be changed into a vast continent , which new generations will inhabit and civilize in their turn . """,23
"after walking a mile we reached the outskirts of a vast forest , but not one of those forests of fungi which bordered port gr√§uben .",10
"as if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast gloom of the moor that strange cry which i had already heard upon the borders of the great grimpen mire . it came with the wind through the silence of the night , a long , deep mutter , then a rising howl , and then the sad moan in which it died away . again and again it sounded , the whole air throbbing with it , strident , wild , and menacing . the baronet caught my sleeve and his face glimmered white through the darkness .",13
"it really appeared as if it formed the central point of vast cyclones , which beat it perpetually as the whip does the top , only here it was the top which was motionless and the whip which moved .",11
"the prairie , across which the sledge was moving in a straight line , was as flat as a sea . it seemed like a vast frozen lake . the railroad which ran through this section ascended from the south - west to the north - west by great island , columbus , an important nebraska town , schuyler , and fremont , to omaha . it followed throughout the right bank of the platte river . the sledge , shortening this route , took a chord of the arc described by the railway . mudge was not afraid of being stopped by the platte river , because it was frozen . the road , then , was quite clear of obstacles , and phileas fogg had but two things to fear -- an accident to the sledge , and a change or calm in the wind .",25
"it was for other traces than those of animals that he searched the thickets of the vast forest , but nothing suspicious ever appeared .",16
"i obeyed like an automaton . coming out from the priest 's house , the professor took a straight road , which , through an opening in the basaltic wall , led away from the sea . we were soon in the open country , if one may give that name to a vast extent of mounds of volcanic products . this tract seemed crushed under a rain of enormous ejected rocks of trap , basalt , granite , and all kinds of igneous rocks .",53
"then , as the wheels rolled over a fine gravel , milady could hear a vast roaring , which she at once recognized as the noise of the sea dashing against some steep cliff .",15
"such as were only beautiful gave their beauty , whence , without doubt , comes the proverb , "" the most beautiful girl in the world can only give what she has . "" such as were rich gave in addition a part of their money ; and a vast number of heroes of that gallant period may be cited who would neither have won their spurs in the first place , nor their battles afterward , without the purse , more or less furnished , which their mistress fastened to the saddle bow .",49
"after we had passed the basaltic wall of the fiord of stapi we passed over a vegetable fibrous peat bog , left from the ancient vegetation of this peninsula . the vast quantity of this unworked fuel would be sufficient to warm the whole population of iceland for a century ; this vast turbary measured in certain ravines had in many places a depth of seventy feet , and presented layers of carbonized remains of vegetation alternating with thinner layers of tufaceous pumice .",31

"but at a later period a wide chasm formed diagonally from south - west to north - east , through which was gradually forced out the trachyte which was to form a mountain chain . no violence accompanied this change ; the matter thrown out was in vast quantities , and the liquid material oozing out from the abysses of the earth slowly spread in extensive plains or in hillocky masses . to this period belong the felspar , syenites , and porphyries .",47
"this wonderful underground conversation , carried on with a distance of four miles and a quarter between us , concluded with these words of hope . i thanked god from my heart , for it was he who had conducted me through those vast solitudes to the point where , alone of all others perhaps , the voices of my companions could have reached me .",43
"that sharp peak might hence be considered as the gnomon of a vast sun dial , the shadow projected from which on a certain day would point out the road to the centre of the earth .",12
"of the treasures contained in the coffer left by captain nemo to the colonists of lincoln island , the larger portion was employed in the purchase of a vast territory in the state of iowa .",28
"it was a stormy and dark night ; vast clouds covered the heavens , concealing the stars ; the moon would not rise till midnight .",8
"then i remembered the theory of an english captain , who likened the earth to a vast hollow sphere , in the interior of which the air became luminous because of the vast pressure that weighed upon it ; while two stars , pluto and proserpine , rolled within upon the circuit of their mysterious orbits .",32
"if the grotto of guachara , in colombia , visited by humboldt , had not given up the whole of the secret of its depth to the philosopher , who investigated it to the depth of 2,500 feet , it probably did not extend much farther . the immense mammoth cave in kentucky is of gigantic proportions , since its vaulted roof rises five hundred feet [ 1 ] above the level of an unfathomable lake and travellers have explored its ramifications to the extent of forty miles . but what were these cavities compared to that in which i stood with wonder and admiration , with its sky of luminous vapours , its bursts of electric light , and a vast sea filling its bed ? my imagination fell powerless before such immensity .",121
"it was not such a shore as is usually formed by nature , either by extending a vast carpet of sand , or by grouping masses of rock , but a beautiful border consisting of the most splendid trees .",17
"the room in which i found myself was very large and lofty . the windows were long , narrow , and pointed , and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within .",26
there the passage ended in a vast and magnificent cavern .,6
"at the moment of becoming engulfed in this dark gallery , i raised my head , and saw for the last time through the length of that vast tube the sky of iceland , which i was never to behold again .",27
"no outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent , and no torch or other artificial source of light was discernible ; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout , and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor .",9
"at length this vast effusion of electric light faded away , and soon after the "" nautilus , "" now the tomb of captain nemo , reposed in its ocean bed .",3
""" nor that either , "" he answered . "" this is no northern mountain ; here are no granite peaks capped with snow . look , axel , look ! "" above our heads , at a height of five hundred feet or more , we saw the crater of a volcano , through which , at intervals of fifteen minutes or so , there issued with loud explosions lofty columns of fire , mingled with pumice stones , ashes , and flowing lava . i could feel the heaving of the mountain , which seemed to breathe like a huge whale , and puff out fire and wind from its vast blowholes . beneath , down a pretty steep declivity , ran streams of lava for eight or nine hundred feet , giving the mountain a height of about 1,300 or 1,400 feet . but the base of the mountain was hidden in a perfect bower of rich verdure , amongst which i was able to distinguish the olive , the fig , and vines , covered with their luscious purple bunches .",112
"mr . fogg and his servant went ashore at aden to have the passport again visaed ; fix , unobserved , followed them . the visa procured , mr . fogg returned on board to resume his former habits ; while passepartout , according to custom , sauntered about among the mixed population of somalis , banyans , parsees , jews , arabs , and europeans who comprise the twenty - five thousand inhabitants of aden . he gazed with wonder upon the fortifications which make this place the gibraltar of the indian ocean , and the vast cisterns where the english engineers were still at work , two thousand years after the engineers of solomon . "" very curious , very curious , "" said passepartout to himself , on returning to the steamer . "" i see that it is by no means useless to travel , if a man wants to see something new . """,97
"everybody knows that the great reversed triangle of land , with its base in the north and its apex in the south , which is called india , embraces fourteen hundred thousand square miles , upon which is spread unequally a population of one hundred and eighty millions of souls . the british crown exercises a real and despotic dominion over the larger portion of this vast country , and has a governor - general stationed at calcutta , governors at madras , bombay , and in bengal , and a lieutenant - governor at agra .",66
"still i had courageously shouldered my burden again , and was rapidly following hans , whom my uncle preceded . i was anxious not to be left behind . my greatest care was not to lose sight of my companions . i shuddered at the thought of being lost in the mazes of this vast subterranean labyrinth .",54
"i made no answer , but went and sat forward . the northern shore was already beginning to dip under the horizon . the eastern and western strands spread wide as if to bid us farewell . before our eyes lay far and wide a vast sea ; shadows of great clouds swept heavily over its silver - grey surface ; the glistening bluish rays of electric light , here and there reflected by the dancing drops of spray , shot out little sheaves of light from the track we left in our rear . soon we entirely lost sight of land ; no object was left for the eye to judge by , and but for the frothy track of the raft , i might have thought we were standing still .",45
"our raft skirted the whole length of the fuci , three or four thousand feet long , undulating like vast serpents beyond the reach of sight ; i found some amusement in tracing these endless waves , always thinking i should come to the end of them , and for hours my patience was vying with my surprise .",19
"the opposite coast formed one vast bay , terminating on the south by a very sharp point , which was destitute of all vegetation , and was of a very wild aspect .",5
"this cavern was about a hundred feet wide and a hundred and fifty in height . a large mass had been rent asunder by a subterranean disturbance . yielding to some vast power from below it had broken asunder , leaving this great hollow into which human beings were now penetrating for the first time .",31
"the coal measures owe their origin to this period of profuse vegetation . the yet elastic and yielding crust of the earth obeyed the fluid forces beneath . thence innumerable fissures and depressions . the plants , sunk underneath the waters , formed by degrees into vast accumulated masses .",46
"it was just what the engineer had made it out to be in the dark ; that is to say , a vast funnel which extended , widening , to a height of a thousand feet above the plateau .",22
""" but do n't pull me down or strangle me , "" he replied : for the misses eshton were clinging about him now ; and the two dowagers , in vast white wrappers , were bearing down on him like ships in full sail .",31
"it would be , no doubt , parbleu , if we write to lord de winter about affairs of vast importance , of the horrors of the cardinal-- """,19
"they had explored , though only in an imperfect manner , the vast shore of washington bay from claw cape to reptile end , the woody and marshy border of the west coast , and the interminable downs , ending at the open mouth of shark gulf .",12
"they were those which treat of the haunts of sea - fowl ; of "" the solitary rocks and promontories "" by them only inhabited ; of the coast of norway , studded with isles from its southern extremity , the lindeness , or naze , to the north cape-- "" where the northern ocean , in vast whirls , boils round the naked , melancholy isles of farthest thule ; and the atlantic surge pours in among the stormy hebrides . """,57
"on the left , the country appeared to be one vast extent of sandy downs , bristling with thistles .",10
"they had also some fine sporting excursions , which were made during the frost in the vast tadorn marsh .",16
""" yes , "" replied my uncle , "" and there is a sea lizard of vast size . """,16
""" and farther on a monstrous crocodile . look at its vast jaws and its rows of teeth ! it is diving down ! """,11
"snow began to fall an hour after they started , a fine snow , however , which happily could not obstruct the train ; nothing could be seen from the windows but a vast , white sheet , against which the smoke of the locomotive had a greyish aspect .",33
"it was a vast thicket of magnificent trees , crowded together as if pressed for room .",3
"having breakfasted , mr . fogg and his companions resumed their places in the car , and observed the varied landscape which unfolded itself as they passed along the vast prairies , the mountains lining the horizon , and the creeks , with their frothy , foaming streams . sometimes a great herd of buffaloes , massing together in the distance , seemed like a moveable dam . these innumerable multitudes of ruminating beasts often form an insurmountable obstacle to the passage of the trains ; thousands of them have been seen passing over the track for hours together , in compact ranks . the locomotive is then forced to stop and wait till the road is once more clear .",29
""" yes , yes ! "" he cried . "" i see a vast inverted cone rising from the surface . """,13
"yet , if at our present distance from the animal , a distance of twelve leagues at the least , the column of water driven through its blowers may be distinctly seen , it must needs be of vast size . the commonest prudence would counsel immediate flight ; but we did not come so far to be prudent .",38
"at eleven in the morning the train had reached the dividing ridge of the waters at bridger pass , seven thousand five hundred and twenty - four feet above the level of the sea , one of the highest points attained by the track in crossing the rocky mountains . after going about two hundred miles , the travellers at last found themselves on one of those vast plains which extend to the atlantic , and which nature has made so propitious for laying the iron road .",67
"on the declivity of the atlantic basin the first streams , branches of the north platte river , already appeared . the whole northern and eastern horizon was bounded by the immense semi - circular curtain which is formed by the southern portion of the rocky mountains , the highest being laramie peak . between this and the railway extended vast plains , plentifully irrigated . on the right rose the lower spurs of the mountainous mass which extends southward to the sources of the arkansas river , one of the great tributaries of the missouri .",60
"at half - past twelve the travellers caught sight for an instant of fort halleck , which commands that section ; and in a few more hours the rocky mountains were crossed . there was reason to hope , then , that no accident would mark the journey through this difficult country . the snow had ceased falling , and the air became crisp and cold . large birds , frightened by the locomotive , rose and flew off in the distance . no wild beast appeared on the plain . it was a desert in its vast nakedness .",97
"the elephant , thanks to the skilful guidance of the parsee , was advancing rapidly through the still darksome forest , and , an hour after leaving the pagoda , had crossed a vast plain . they made a halt at seven o'clock , the young woman being still in a state of complete prostration . the guide made her drink a little brandy and water , but the drowsiness which stupefied her could not yet be shaken off .",33
"we might give to that vast bay on the east the name of union bay , for example ; to that large hollow on the south , washington bay ; to the mountain upon which we are standing , that of mount franklin ; to that lake which is extended under our eyes , that of lake grant ; nothing could be better , my friends .",5
""" but am i to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber ? "" asked milady .",10
at ten in the morning the symptoms of storm become aggravated . the wind never lulls but to acquire increased strength ; the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts and rushing storms .,23
"i looked round , with a chill of fear in my heart , at the huge swelling plain , mottled with the green patches of rushes . nothing stirred over the vast expanse save a pair of ravens , which croaked loudly from a tor behind us .",31
"beyond that hedge , that garden , and that cottage , a dark mist enveloped with its folds that immensity where paris slept -- a vast void from which glittered a few luminous points , the funeral stars of that hell !",25
"from its first declivities to within two miles of the coast were spread vast masses of wood , relieved by large green patches , caused by the presence of evergreen trees .",13
"dinner was ready . professor liedenbrock devoured his portion voraciously , for his compulsory fast on board had converted his stomach into a vast unfathomable gulf . there was nothing remarkable in the meal itself ; but the hospitality of our host , more danish than icelandic , reminded me of the heroes of old . it was evident that we were more at home than he was himself .",23
""" you must certainly have a vast estate , "" said candide to the turk .",6
"the two found themselves in a small chapel covered with a tapestry of persian silk worked with gold , and brilliantly lighted with a vast number of candles .",24
"four days later , saturday , the 18th of july , in the evening , we arrived at a kind of vast grotto ; and here my uncle paid hans his weekly wages , and it was settled that the next day , sunday , should be a day of rest .",21
"in an hour we had reached the islet . two hours later we had completed a full circle around it . it measured four to five miles in circumference . a narrow channel separated it from a considerable shore , perhaps a continent whose limits we could n't see . the existence of this shore seemed to bear out commander maury 's hypotheses . in essence , this ingenious american has noted that between the south pole and the 60th parallel , the sea is covered with floating ice of dimensions much greater than any found in the north atlantic . from this fact he drew the conclusion that the antarctic circle must contain considerable shores , since icebergs ca n't form on the high seas but only along coastlines . according to his calculations , this frozen mass enclosing the southernmost pole forms a vast ice cap whose width must reach 4,000 kilometers .",145
"such were the loud and startling words which resounded through the air , above the vast watery desert of the pacific , about four o'clock in the evening of the 23rd of march , 1865 .",15
"the panorama of the islands , as they steamed by them , was superb . vast forests of palms , arecs , bamboo , teakwood , of the gigantic mimosa , and tree - like ferns covered the foreground , while behind , the graceful outlines of the mountains were traced against the sky ; and along the coasts swarmed by thousands the precious swallows whose nests furnish a luxurious dish to the tables of the celestial empire . the varied landscape afforded by the andaman islands was soon passed , however , and the rangoon rapidly approached the straits of malacca , which gave access to the china seas .",15
