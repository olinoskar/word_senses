"during the night of december 27 - 28 , the nautilus left the waterways of vanikoro behind with extraordinary speed . its heading was southwesterly , and in three days it had cleared the 750 leagues that separated la pérouse 's islands from the southeastern tip of papua .",32,"('clear', 'franchir', 'franquear')",1

"if my eyes were able to range afar over this great sea , it was because a peculiar light brought to view every detail of it . it was not the light of the sun , with his dazzling shafts of brightness and the splendour of his rays ; nor was it the pale and uncertain shimmer of the moonbeams , the dim reflection of a nobler body of light . no ; the illuminating power of this light , its trembling diffusiveness , its bright , clear whiteness , and its low temperature , showed that it must be of electric origin . it was like an aurora borealis , a continuous cosmical phenomenon , filling a cavern of sufficient extent to contain an ocean .",87,"('clear', 'clair', 'claro')",2
