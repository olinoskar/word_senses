i now drew near and knocked :,3
"meanwhile , briskly unconcerned , the nautilus ran at full propeller through the midst of these ruins . on february 18 , near three o'clock in the morning , it hove before the entrance to the strait of gibraltar .",22
"and a tray was soon brought . how pretty , to my eyes , did the china cups and bright teapot look , placed on the little round table near the fire !",29
""" now is my time to make peace with this gallant man , "" said d’artagnan to himself , having stood on one side during the whole of the latter part of the conversation ; and with this good feeling drawing near to aramis , who was departing without paying any attention to him , "" monsieur , "" said he , "" you will excuse me , i hope . """,41
"i stayed in my stateroom . i wanted to avoid the captain , to hide from his eyes the agitation overwhelming me . what an agonizing day i spent , torn between my desire to regain my free will and my regret at abandoning this marvelous nautilus , leaving my underwater research incomplete ! how could i relinquish this ocean--""my own atlantic , "" as i liked to call it -- without observing its lower strata , without wresting from it the kinds of secrets that had been revealed to me by the seas of the east indies and the pacific ! i was putting down my novel half read , i was waking up as my dream neared its climax ! how painfully the hours passed , as i sometimes envisioned myself safe on shore with my companions , or , despite my better judgment , as i sometimes wished that some unforeseen circumstances would prevent ned land from carrying out his plans .",118
"a few minutes before nine o'clock , i glued my ear to the captain 's door . not a sound . i left my stateroom and returned to the lounge , which was deserted and plunged in near darkness .",37
"i opened the door leading to the library . the same inadequate light , the same solitude . i went to man my post near the door opening into the well of the central companionway . i waited for ned land 's signal .",24
"mr . brocklehurst and his family never came near lowood now : household matters were not scrutinised into ; the cross housekeeper was gone , driven away by the fear of infection ; her successor , who had been matron at the lowton dispensary , unused to the ways of her new abode , provided with comparative liberality .",8
"the captain stretched out on a couch , and i mechanically took a seat near him , but half in the shadows .",14
"an odour of camphor and burnt vinegar warned me when i came near the fever room : and i passed its door quickly , fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me .",12
"i could hardly wait until our position was reported on the chart . near 11:30 the ballast tanks emptied , and the submersible rose to the surface of the ocean . i leaped onto the platform . ned land was already there .",13
""" how comfortable i am ! that last fit of coughing has tired me a little ; i feel as if i could sleep : but do n't leave me , jane ; i like to have you near me . """,38
"near eleven o'clock in the evening , i received a most unexpected visit from captain nemo . he asked me very graciously if i felt exhausted from our vigil the night before . i said no .",0
"then as the steps drew near , she became silent for fear of being heard , applying , with a gesture of infinite terror , her beautiful hand to felton ’s mouth .",5
"the canoe again touched the bottom , and in a few minutes it was moored to a trunk near the right bank .",18
"i sat down near him , but told him i could not eat .",3
""" it is near midnight , "" i said .",3
"it would not thus be necessary to hunt . the engineer advised his companions to refrain from firing , that their presence might not be betrayed to any one near the shore .",29
"near the louvre the four friends met with m. de treville , who was returning from st . germain ; he stopped them to offer his compliments upon their appointments , which in an instant drew round them a hundred gapers .",0
the forest here was composed for the most part of trees which had already been met with near the lake and on prospect heights .,17
"why should i , when both he and i were happier near than apart ?",11
"j.e . is requested to send references , name , address , and all particulars to the direction:-- "" mrs . fairfax , thornfield , near millcote , ---shire . """,25
"i walked a little while on the pavement after tea , thinking of you ; and i beheld you in imagination so near me , i scarcely missed your actual presence .",22
"athos , porthos , and aramis instantly drew near one another , while jussac drew up his soldiers .",8
"it was agreed also that as they were anxious for a minute exploration of the coast they should not sail during the night , but would always , when the weather permitted it , be at anchor near the shore .",37
"athos divided them into three groups , assumed the command of one , gave the second to aramis , and the third to porthos ; and then each group went and took their watch near an entrance .",34
"after breakfast near ten o'clock , we went down onto the embankment .",2
"and the "" bonadventure "" sailed as near as possible to the rocky shore .",7
"near three o'clock in the afternoon on july 6 , fifteen miles south of shore , the abraham lincoln doubled that solitary islet at the tip of the south american continent , that stray rock dutch seamen had named cape horn after their hometown of hoorn . our course was set for the northwest , and the next day our frigate 's propeller finally churned the waters of the pacific .",0
"that evening the "" bonadventure "" anchored in a small bay to the north of the island , near the land , such was the depth of water there .",18
""" well , that is beautiful , miss jane ! it is as fine a picture as any miss reed 's drawing - master could paint , let alone the young ladies themselves , who could not come near it : and have you learnt french ? """,38
""" you had a little cottage near the school , you say : did he ever come there to see you ? """,6
""" but it must not be forgotten that winter is drawing near , and that in severe frost wood is difficult to work .",11
""" yes ; the back parlour was both his study and ours : he sat near the window , and we by the table . """,15
""" anchor near land , with bad weather coming on ! "" exclaimed the sailor .",2
""" thank god ! "" he exclaimed , "" that if anything malignant did come near you last night , it was only the veil that was harmed .",15
"all this timber was piled up under a large shed , built near the chimneys , and there awaited the time for use .",12
"at twelve o'clock , when the small band of adventurers halted for breakfast at the foot of a large group of firs , near a little stream which fell in cascades , they found themselves still half way from the first plateau , which most probably they would not reach till nightfall .",23
"however , near midnight it disappeared , or to use a more appropriate expression , "" it went out , "" like a huge glowworm . had it fled from us ? we were duty bound to fear so rather than hope so . but at 12:53 in the morning , a deafening hiss became audible , resembling the sound made by a waterspout expelled with tremendous intensity .",2
""" but to get near it , "" the commander went on , "" i 'd have to put a whaleboat at your disposal ? """,4
""" john clayton , 3 turpey street , the borough . my cab is out of shipley 's yard , near waterloo station . """,20
"the engineer was somewhat uneasy on account of the dockyard shed -- which besides , he could not have established in any other place near to granite house -- for the islet only imperfectly sheltered the shore from the fury of the open sea , and in great storms the waves beat against the very foot of the granite cliff .",24
""" he hailed me at half - past nine in trafalgar square . he said that he was a detective , and he offered me two guineas if i would do exactly what he wanted all day and ask no questions . i was glad enough to agree . first we drove down to the northumberland hotel and waited there until two gentlemen came out and took a cab from the rank . we followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere near here .

""" the severe cold experienced in lincoln island , "" said gideon spilett , "" may then perhaps be explained by the presence of floes or icebergs comparatively near to lincoln island . """,28
"he is not like you , sir : i am not happy at his side , nor near him , nor with him . he has no indulgence for me -- no fondness . he sees nothing attractive in me ; not even youth -- only a few useful mental points.--then i must leave you , sir , to go to him ? """,17
"in fact , since the sun is nearer to this hemisphere during the summer , it is necessarily more distant during the winter .",7
"farther off were hills : not so lofty as those round lowood , nor so craggy , nor so like barriers of separation from the living world ; but yet quiet and lonely hills enough , and seeming to embrace thornfield with a seclusion i had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of millcote .",52
"now , the earth occupies one of the foci of the ellipse , and so at one point in its course is at its apogee , that is , at its farthest from the sun , and at another point it is at its perigee , or nearest to the sun .",47
"cyrus harding and the boy walked near each other , without speaking .",6
"and the clergyman , who had not lifted his eyes from his book , and had held his breath but for a moment , was proceeding : his hand was already stretched towards mr . rochester , as his lips unclosed to ask , "" wilt thou have this woman for thy wedded wife?""--when a distinct and near voice said--",57
"to be sure i am distantly related to the rochesters by the mother 's side , or at least my husband was ; he was a clergyman , incumbent of hay -- that little village yonder on the hill -- and that church near the gates was his .",43
"then , through the grating to which she had drawn near , milady saw the young man make a sign with delirious fervor , and depart in an apparent transport of joy .",10
""" most certainly . keep your revolver near you night and day , and never relax your precautions . """,7
"at half - past twelve the train stopped at burhampoor where passepartout was able to purchase some indian slippers , ornamented with false pearls , in which , with evident vanity , he proceeded to encase his feet . the travellers made a hasty breakfast and started off for assurghur , after skirting for a little the banks of the small river tapty , which empties into the gulf of cambray , near surat .",72
"near eleven o'clock in the morning , while on the surface of the ocean , the nautilus fell in with a herd of baleen whales . this encounter did n't surprise me , because i knew these animals were being hunted so relentlessly that they took refuge in the ocean basins of the high latitudes .",0
"as the hour to wait upon the king was not till twelve , he had made a party with porthos and aramis to play a game at tennis in a tennis court situated near the stables of the luxembourg .",33
"but one of these balls , launched by porthos ’ herculean hand , passed so close to d’artagnan ’s face that he thought that if , instead of passing near , it had hit him , his audience would have been probably lost , as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before the king .",29
"now , as upon this audience , in his gascon imagination , depended his future life , he saluted aramis and porthos politely , declaring that he would not resume the game until he should be prepared to play with them on more equal terms , and went and took his place near the cord and in the gallery .",52
""" by thunder ! in ' 65 , just two and a half years ago , i to whom you speak , i myself stepped onto the carcass of a whale near greenland , and its flank still carried the marked harpoon of a whaling ship from the bering sea . now i ask you , after it had been wounded west of america , how could this animal be killed in the east , unless it had cleared the equator and doubled cape horn or the cape of good hope ? """,31
"everything was in the same state . the duke of buckingham and his english , masters of the isle of re , continued to besiege , but without success , the citadel st . martin and the fort of la pree ; and hostilities with la rochelle had commenced , two or three days before , about a fort which the duc d’angouleme had caused to be constructed near the city .",68
"immense waves threatened to overwhelm the island , and certainly any vessel anchored near the shore would have been dashed to pieces .",13
""" and it was last monday night , somewhere near midnight ? """,9
""" some of that at the bottom , near the laths . there are twenty - five bottles of it left ; all the rest were broken by my fall .",8
"near one o'clock in the morning , i was overcome with tremendous exhaustion . my limbs stiffened in the grip of intense cramps . conseil had to keep me going , and attending to our self - preservation became his sole responsibility . i soon heard the poor lad gasping ; his breathing became shallow and quick . i did n't think he could stand such exertions for much longer .",0
"reader , it was on monday night -- near midnight -- that i too had received the mysterious summons : those were the very words by which i replied to it . i listened to mr . rochester 's narrative , but made no disclosure in return .",8
""" yes , "" said harding ; "" and since this stream feeds the lake , most probably on the side near the sea there is an outlet by which the surplus water escapes .",21
"the door nearest me opened , and a servant came out,--a woman of between thirty and forty ; a set , square - made figure , red - haired , and with a hard , plain face : any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely be conceived .",2
"it was not known whether , after the taking of the bastion , the rochellais had evacuated it or left a garrison in it ; the object then was to examine the place near enough to verify the reports .",33
"he and neb , armed with axes , chose two trees near the water , and began to attack them at the base .",11
"i meant to become her governess once more , but i soon found this impracticable ; my time and cares were now required by another -- my husband needed them all . so i sought out a school conducted on a more indulgent system , and near enough to permit of my visiting her often , and bringing her home sometimes .",46
""" be not far from me , for trouble is near : there is none to help . """,10
"near four o'clock in the morning , the submersible picked up speed . we could barely cope with this dizzying rush , and the waves battered us at close range . fortunately ned 's hands came across a big mooring ring fastened to the topside of this sheet - iron back , and we all held on for dear life .",0
"it was very near , but not yet in sight ; when , in addition to the tramp , tramp , i heard a rush under the hedge , and close down by the hazel stems glided a great dog , whose black and white colour made him a distinct object against the trees .",3
"going along the 55th meridian , the nautilus cut the antarctic circle on march 16 near eight o'clock in the morning . ice completely surrounded us and closed off the horizon . nevertheless , captain nemo went from passageway to passageway , always proceeding south .",15
"the canoe was hauled up on the beach near the chimneys , and all proceeded towards the ladder of granite house .",8
"in two days more we sighted the coast of scotland near peterhead , and the _ valkyria _ turned her lead towards the faroe islands , passing between the orkneys and shetlands .",10
i was in the library -- sitting in his chair -- he was quite near .,14
"the traveller now , stooping , felt his foot and leg , as if trying whether they were sound ; apparently something ailed them , for he halted to the stile whence i had just risen , and sat down . i was in the mood for being useful , or at least officious , i think , for i now drew near him again .",62
"we started a stag of ten branches . we chased him for six hours , and when he was near being taken -- when st.-simon was already putting his horn to his mouth to sound the mort -- crack , all the pack takes the wrong scent and sets off after a two - year - older .",19
"himself has hitherto sufficed to the toil , and the toil draws near its close : his glorious sun hastens to its setting .",12
"for ned land , as well as for every navigator before us , i knew that this was the great insurmountable obstacle . when the sun appeared for an instant near noon , captain nemo took a reasonably accurate sight that gave our position as longitude 51 degrees 30 ' and latitude 67 degrees 39 ' south . this was a position already well along in these antarctic regions .",30
""" concealing the mad - woman 's neighbourhood from you , however , was something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a upas - tree : that demon 's vicinage is poisoned , and always was .",26
"indeed , despite its efforts , despite the powerful methods it used to split this ice , the nautilus was reduced to immobility . ordinarily , when someone ca n't go any farther , he still has the option of returning in his tracks . but here it was just as impossible to turn back as to go forward , because every passageway had closed behind us , and if our submersible remained even slightly stationary , it would be frozen in without delay . which is exactly what happened near two o'clock in the afternoon , and fresh ice kept forming over the ship 's sides with astonishing speed . i had to admit that captain nemo 's leadership had been most injudicious .",90
"she was nearer , but in what direction was she sailing ?",2
"a small fly or moth had fluttered across our path , and in an instant stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it . to my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire , and my acquaintance never paused for an instant , bounding from tuft to tuft behind it , his green net waving in the air . his gray clothes and jerky , zigzag , irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself . i was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the treacherous mire , when i heard the sound of steps , and turning round found a woman near me upon the path . she had come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of merripit house , but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close .",126
""" then , "" continued milady , "" then i collected all my strength ; i recalled to my mind that the moment of vengeance , or rather , of justice , had struck . i looked upon myself as another judith ; i gathered myself up , my knife in my hand , and when i saw him near me , stretching out his arms to find his victim , then , with the last cry of agony and despair , i struck him in the middle of his breast .",59
"the wounded man sank upon his knees , to again kiss the feet of his preserver ; but d’artagnan , who had no longer a motive for staying so near the enemy , abridged the testimonials of his gratitude .",29
""" because the ' duncan ' is a steam - yacht , and i can not perceive any trace of smoke either above or near that vessel . """,24
"we must wait until she is nearer , and then we shall soon know what to expect . """,6
"meanwhile preparations for this daring attempt were getting under way . the nautilus 's powerful pumps forced air down into the tanks and stored it under high pressure . near four o'clock captain nemo informed me that the platform hatches were about to be closed . i took a last look at the dense ice bank we were going to conquer . the weather was fair , the skies reasonably clear , the cold quite brisk , namely -12 degrees centigrade ; but after the wind had lulled , this temperature did n't seem too unbearable .",29
"but by continuing in this direction she must soon disappear behind claw cape , as the wind was from the southwest , and to watch her it would be then necessary to ascend the height of washington bay , near port balloon -- a provoking circumstance , for it was already five o'clock in the evening , and the twilight would soon make any observation extremely difficult .",39
"near two o'clock in the morning , i went to snatch a few hours of sleep . conseil did likewise . i did n't encounter captain nemo while going down the gangways . i assumed that he was keeping to the pilothouse .",0
"i drew near , and found he was bidding a hundred pistoles for a chestnut nag . ’ pardieu , ’ said i , ’ my good gentleman , i have a horse to sell , too . ’ ’ ay , and a very fine one !",2
"two wax candles stood lighted on the table , and two on the mantelpiece ; basking in the light and heat of a superb fire , lay pilot -- adele knelt near him .",31
"d’artagnan drew near the window , and lent his ear .",2
"that night my sleep was fitful . hope and fear besieged me by turns . i got up several times . the nautilus continued groping . near three o'clock in the morning , i observed that we encountered the ice bank 's underbelly at a depth of only fifty meters . so only 150 feet separated us from the surface of the water . little by little the ice bank was turning into an ice field again . the mountains were changing back into plains .",26

"at eleven o'clock the rangoon rode out of singapore harbour , and in a few hours the high mountains of malacca , with their forests , inhabited by the most beautifully - furred tigers in the world , were lost to view . singapore is distant some thirteen hundred miles from the island of hong kong , which is a little english colony near the chinese coast . phileas fogg hoped to accomplish the journey in six days , so as to be in time for the steamer which would leave on the 6th of november for yokohama , the principal japanese port .",63
he then took up his station near the window and gazed through the foliage .,6
"cyrus harding drew near the captain , and gideon spilett took his hand -- it was of a feverish heat .",3
"passing near these unusual animals , i could examine them at my leisure since they did n't stir . their hides were rough and heavy , a tan color leaning toward a reddish brown ; their coats were short and less than abundant . some were four meters long . more tranquil and less fearful than their northern relatives , they posted no sentinels on guard duty at the approaches to their campsite .",1
"there was near by what the astronomers would call a disturbing star , which might have produced an agitation in this gentleman 's heart . but no ! the charms of aouda failed to act , to passepartout 's great surprise ; and the disturbances , if they existed , would have been more difficult to calculate than those of uranus which led to the discovery of neptune .",2
"i found a place near him and waited without speaking . noon arrived , and just as on the day before , the sun did n't put in an appearance .",4
"the captain had resumed his position on the divan , and leaning on his arm , he regarded the engineer , seated near him .",22
adele and mrs . fairfax drew near to see the pictures .,6
"their companions had drawn near , and the gratitude with which their hearts were charged was about to express itself in their gestures and words . captain nemo stopped them by a sign , and in a voice which betrayed more emotion than he doubtless intended to show .",4
"meanwhile the ballast tanks filled with water and the nautilus sank slowly . at a depth of 1,000 feet , it stopped . its propeller churned the waves and it headed due north at a speed of fifteen miles per hour . near the afternoon it was already cruising under the immense frozen carapace of the ice bank .",42
"it was one o'clock when we left no . 3 , lauriston gardens . sherlock holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office , whence he dispatched a long telegram . he then hailed a cab , and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us by lestrade .",20

"it was a library . tall , black - rosewood bookcases , inlaid with copperwork , held on their wide shelves a large number of uniformly bound books . these furnishings followed the contours of the room , their lower parts leading to huge couches upholstered in maroon leather and curved for maximum comfort . light , movable reading stands , which could be pushed away or pulled near as desired , allowed books to be positioned on them for easy study . in the center stood a huge table covered with pamphlets , among which some newspapers , long out of date , were visible . electric light flooded this whole harmonious totality , falling from four frosted half globes set in the scrollwork of the ceiling . i stared in genuine wonderment at this room so ingeniously laid out , and i could n't believe my eyes .",68
"it gazed and gazed on me . it spoke to my spirit : immeasurably distant was the tone , yet so near , it whispered in my heart--",21

"a practiced workman can make , without a machine , about ten thousand bricks in twelve hours ; but in their two days work the five brickmakers on lincoln island had not made more than three thousand , which were ranged near each other , until the time when their complete desiccation would permit them to be used in building the oven , that is to say , in three or four days .",41
"herbert , who had drawn near the captain , fell on his knees and kissed his hand .",5

"it had been decided that a corral should be established near the sources of the red creek , at the foot of mount franklin , destined to contain the ruminants , whose presence would have been troublesome at granite house , and especially for the musmons , who were to supply the wool for the settlers ' winter garments .",10
"i drew near houses ; i left them , and came back again , and again i wandered away : always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to ask -- no right to expect interest in my isolated lot .",2
"near the churchyard , and in the middle of a garden , stood a well - built though small house , which i had no doubt was the parsonage .",0

"an unbearable heaviness weighed me down . near three o'clock in the afternoon , this agonizing sensation affected me to an intense degree . yawns dislocated my jaws . my lungs were gasping in their quest for that enkindling elastic fluid required for breathing , now growing scarcer and scarcer . my mind was in a daze . i lay outstretched , strength gone , nearly unconscious . my gallant conseil felt the same symptoms , suffered the same sufferings , yet never left my side . he held my hand , he kept encouraging me , and i even heard him mutter :",7

"the very cultivation surrounding it had disappeared . i had , by cross - ways and by- paths , once more drawn near the tract of moorland ; and now , only a few fields , almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which they were scarcely reclaimed , lay between me and the dusky hill .",22
"there were moments , indeed , at night , when , lying sleepless in his own delicately scented chamber , or in the sordid room of the little ill - famed tavern near the docks which , under an assumed name and in disguise , it was his habit to frequent , he would think of the ruin he had brought upon his soul with a pity that was all the more poignant because it was purely selfish . but moments such as these were rare . that curiosity about life which lord henry had first stirred in him , as they sat together in the garden of their friend , seemed to increase with gratification . the more he knew , the more he desired to know . he had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them .",32
"porthos , seeing this , retwisted his mustache , elongated his imperial a second time , and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near the choir , and who not only was a beautiful lady , but still further , no doubt , a great lady -- for she had behind her a negro boy who had brought the cushion on which she knelt , and a female servant who held the emblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the mass .",27
"near the middle of the platform , the skiff was half set in the ship 's hull , making a slight bulge . fore and aft stood two cupolas of moderate height , their sides slanting and partly inset with heavy biconvex glass , one reserved for the helmsman steering the nautilus , the other for the brilliance of the powerful electric beacon lighting his way .",0

"as i approached the hut , walking as warily as stapleton would do when with poised net he drew near the settled butterfly , i satisfied myself that the place had indeed been used as a habitation . a vague pathway among the boulders led to the dilapidated opening which served as a door . all was silent within . the unknown might be lurking there , or he might be prowling on the moor . my nerves tingled with the sense of adventure . throwing aside my cigarette , i closed my hand upon the butt of my revolver and , walking swiftly up to the door , i looked in . the place was empty .",19
"going back under the waters , the nautilus drew near the coast , cruising along it for only a few miles . through the lounge windows i could see long creepers and gigantic fucus plants , bulb - bearing seaweed of which the open sea at the pole had revealed a few specimens ; with their smooth , viscous filaments , they measured as much as 300 meters long ; genuine cables more than an inch thick and very tough , they 're often used as mooring lines for ships . another weed , known by the name velp and boasting four - foot leaves , was crammed into the coral concretions and carpeted the ocean floor . it served as both nest and nourishment for myriads of crustaceans and mollusks , for crabs and cuttlefish . here seals and otters could indulge in a sumptuous meal , mixing meat from fish with vegetables from the sea , like the english with their irish stews .",9
"the nautilus passed over these lush , luxuriant depths with tremendous speed . near evening it approached the falkland islands , whose rugged summits i recognized the next day . the sea was of moderate depth . so not without good reason , i assumed that these two islands , plus the many islets surrounding them , used to be part of the magellan coastline . the falkland islands were probably discovered by the famous navigator john davis , who gave them the name davis southern islands . later sir richard hawkins called them the maidenland , after the blessed virgin . subsequently , at the beginning of the 18th century , they were named the malouines by fishermen from saint - malo in brittany , then finally dubbed the falklands by the english , to whom they belong today .",13

"after leaving these delightful islands to the protection of the french flag , the nautilus covered about 2,000 miles from december 4 to the 11th . its navigating was marked by an encounter with an immense school of squid , unusual mollusks that are near neighbors of the cuttlefish . french fishermen give them the name "" cuckoldfish , "" and they belong to the class cephalopoda , family dibranchiata , consisting of themselves together with cuttlefish and argonauts . the naturalists of antiquity made a special study of them , and these animals furnished many ribald figures of speech for soapbox orators in the greek marketplace , as well as excellent dishes for the tables of rich citizens , if we 're to believe athenaeus , a greek physician predating galen .",44

"i was near two months performing this last work , viz . rigging and fitting my masts and sails ; for i finished them very complete , making a small stay , and a sail , or foresail , to it , to assist if we should turn to windward ; and , what was more than all , i fixed a rudder to the stern of her to steer with . i was but a bungling shipwright , yet as i knew the usefulness and even necessity of such a thing , i applied myself with so much pains to do it , that at last i brought it to pass ; though , considering the many dull contrivances i had for it that failed , i think it cost me almost as much labour as making the boat .",2
"having given some further directions , and intimates that he should call again the next day , he departed ; to my grief : i felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near my pillow ; and as he closed the door after him , all the room darkened and my heart again sank : inexpressible sadness weighed it down .",36
"at length d’artagnan , in pursuing his researches , found near the wall a woman ’s torn glove .",10
"bessie went into the housemaid 's apartment , which was near . i heard her say--",10
"it is true i had been very unfortunate by sea , and this might be one of the reasons ; but let no man slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts in cases of such moment : two of the ships which i had singled out to go in , i mean more particularly singled out than any other , having put my things on board one of them , and in the other having agreed with the captain ; i say two of these ships miscarried . one was taken by the algerines , and the other was lost on the start , near torbay , and all the people drowned except three ; so that in either of those vessels i had been made miserable .",105

"our lights produced a thousand delightful effects while playing over these brightly colored boughs . i fancied i saw these cylindrical , membrane - filled tubes trembling beneath the water 's undulations . i was tempted to gather their fresh petals , which were adorned with delicate tentacles , some newly in bloom , others barely opened , while nimble fish with fluttering fins brushed past them like flocks of birds . but if my hands came near the moving flowers of these sensitive , lively creatures , an alarm would instantly sound throughout the colony . the white petals retracted into their red sheaths , the flowers vanished before my eyes , and the bush changed into a chunk of stony nipples .",77
"they did well to hasten , for at a turn of the path near a clearing they saw the lad thrown on the ground and in the grasp of a savage being , apparently a gigantic ape , who was about to do him some great harm .",13
"we had , first and last , killed about threescore of them , and had it been daylight we had killed many more . the field of battle being thus cleared , we made forward again , for we had still near a league to go . we heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the woods as we went several times , and sometimes we fancied we saw some of them ; but the snow dazzling our eyes , we were not certain . in about an hour more we came to the town where we were to lodge , which we found in a terrible fright and all in arms ; for , it seems , the night before the wolves and some bears had broken into the village , and put them in such terror that they were obliged to keep guard night and day , but especially in the night , to preserve their cattle , and indeed their people .",41
"by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window , and on it ( as she had hoped ) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves : she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves , and was just going to leave the room , when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking- glass . there was no label this time with the words ' drink me , ' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips . ' i know something interesting is sure to happen , ' she said to herself , ' whenever i eat or drink anything ; so i 'll just see what this bottle does . i do hope it 'll make me grow large again , for really i 'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing !

"nevertheless , i 'm well aware that the nautilus is drawing near to populated shores , and if some chance for salvation becomes available to us , it would be sheer cruelty to sacrifice my companions to my passion for the unknown . i must go with them , perhaps even guide them . but will this opportunity ever arise ? the human being , robbed of his free will , craves such an opportunity ; but the scientist , forever inquisitive , dreads it .",11

"the great question certainly was , what ? alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass , but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances . there was a large mushroom growing near her , about the same height as herself ; and when she had looked under it , and on both sides of it , and behind it , it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it .",48
"his hard eyes darted a piercing glance at the three men , who walked near him , but nothing denoted that he recollected being their fellow , or at least having been so .",14
"on january 25 , the ocean being completely deserted , the nautilus spent the day on the surface , churning the waves with its powerful propeller and making them spurt to great heights . under these conditions , who would n't have mistaken it for a gigantic cetacean ? i spent three - quarters of the day on the platform . i stared at the sea . nothing on the horizon , except near four o'clock in the afternoon a long steamer to the west , running on our opposite tack . its masting was visible for an instant , but it could n't have seen the nautilus because we were lying too low in the water . i imagine that steamboat belonged to the peninsular & oriental line , which provides service from the island of ceylon to sidney , also calling at king george sound and melbourne .",73
"at length she heard the grating of the hinges of the opening gates ; the noise of boots and spurs resounded on the stairs . there was a great murmur of voices which continued to draw near , amid which she seemed to hear her own name pronounced .",36
"on the 28th of march , 1863 , some excavators working under the direction of m. boucher de perthes , in the stone quarries of moulin quignon , near abbeville , in the department of somme , found a human jawbone fourteen feet beneath the surface . it was the first fossil of this nature that had ever been brought to light . not far distant were found stone hatchets and flint arrow - heads stained and encased by lapse of time with a uniform coat of rust .",28

"they entered the roadstead ; but as they drew near in order to cast anchor , a little cutter , looking like a coastguard formidably armed , approached the merchant vessel and dropped into the sea a boat which directed its course to the ladder .",9
"then the vessel resumed its course , still escorted by the little cutter , which sailed side by side with it , menacing it with the mouths of its six cannon . the boat followed in the wake of the ship , a speck near the enormous mass .",44

"all this being nothing to me , my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the spectacle of a little hungry robin , which came and chirruped on the twigs of the leafless cherry - tree nailed against the wall near the casement .",40
"as they drew near the town they saw a negro stretched on the ground with only one half of his habit , which was a kind of linen frock ; for the poor man had lost his left leg and his right hand .",3

"near 5:30 the first glimmers of light on the horizon defined the upper lines of the coast with greater distinctness . fairly flat to the east , it swelled a little toward the south . five miles still separated it from us , and its beach merged with the misty waters . between us and the shore , the sea was deserted . not a boat , not a diver . profound solitude reigned over this gathering place of pearl fishermen . as captain nemo had commented , we were arriving in these waterways a month too soon .",0
"during the time which lord de winter took to shut the door , close a shutter , and draw a chair near to his sister - in - law ’s fauteuil , milady , anxiously thoughtful , plunged her glance into the depths of possibility , and discovered all the plan , of which she could not even obtain a glance as long as she was ignorant into whose hands she had fallen .",21

"near seven o'clock we finally surveyed the bank of shellfish , where pearl oysters reproduce by the millions . these valuable mollusks stick to rocks , where they 're strongly attached by a mass of brown filaments that forbids their moving about . in this respect oysters are inferior even to mussels , to whom nature has not denied all talent for locomotion .",0

"candide listened to this discourse with great attention , and conceived a high opinion of the person who delivered it ; and as the marchioness had taken care to place him near her side , he took the liberty to whisper her softly in the ear and ask who this person was that spoke so well .",31
"this done , pencroft , passing among the grass and concealing himself skillfully , placed the end of his lines armed with hooks near the grouse nests ; then he returned , took the other ends and hid with herbert behind a large tree .",23

"then the nautilus drew near the beaches of africa , where the sea is considerably deeper . there , through the open panels and in a midwater of crystal clarity , our ship enabled us to study wonderful bushes of shining coral and huge chunks of rock wrapped in splendid green furs of algae and fucus . what an indescribable sight , and what a variety of settings and scenery where these reefs and volcanic islands leveled off by the libyan coast ! but soon the nautilus hugged the eastern shore where these tree forms appeared in all their glory . this was off the coast of tihama , and there such zoophyte displays not only flourished below sea level but they also fashioned picturesque networks that unreeled as high as ten fathoms above it ; the latter were more whimsical but less colorful than the former , which kept their bloom thanks to the moist vitality of the waters .",4
"the night before he left home , happening to see him walking in the garden about sunset , and remembering , as i looked at him , that this man , alienated as he now was , had once saved my life , and that we were near relations , i was moved to make a last attempt to regain his friendship .",47

"sometimes when the cardinal , always on horseback , like the lowest gendarme of the army , cast a pensive glance over those works , so slowly keeping pace with his wishes , which the engineers , brought from all the corners of france , were executing under his orders , if he met a musketeer of the company of treville , he drew near and looked at him in a peculiar manner , and not recognizing in him one of our four companions , he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in another direction .",64
