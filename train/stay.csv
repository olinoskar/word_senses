"i stayed in my stateroom . i wanted to avoid the captain , to hide from his eyes the agitation overwhelming me . what an agonizing day i spent , torn between my desire to regain my free will and my regret at abandoning this marvelous nautilus , leaving my underwater research incomplete ! how could i relinquish this ocean--""my own atlantic , "" as i liked to call it -- without observing its lower strata , without wresting from it the kinds of secrets that had been revealed to me by the seas of the east indies and the pacific ! i was putting down my novel half read , i was waking up as my dream neared its climax ! how painfully the hours passed , as i sometimes envisioned myself safe on shore with my companions , or , despite my better judgment , as i sometimes wished that some unforeseen circumstances would prevent ned land from carrying out his plans .",1,"('stay', 'demeurer', 'permanecer')",2
