' you may be cajoled into imagining that your own special trade or your own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff , but it stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run keep away wealth from the country , diminish the value of our imports , and lower the general conditions of life in this island .

"it was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog had lifted . meanwhile we left lestrade in possession of the house while holmes and i went back with the baronet to baskerville hall . the story of the stapletons could no longer be withheld from him , but he took the blow bravely when he learned the truth about the woman whom he had loved . but the shock of the night 's adventures had shattered his nerves , and before morning he lay delirious in a high fever , under the care of dr . mortimer . the two of them were destined to travel together round the world before sir henry had become once more the hale , hearty man that he had been before he became master of that ill - omened estate .",27
"i went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning 's conversation for holmes . it was evident to me that he had been very busy of late , for the notes which i had from baker street were few and short , with no comments upon the information which i had supplied and hardly any reference to my mission . no doubt his blackmailing case is absorbing all his faculties . and yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his interest . i wish that he were here .",18

"i was certainly feeling very weary , so i obeyed his injunction . i left holmes seated in front of the smouldering fire , and long into the watches of the night i heard the low , melancholy wailings of his violin , and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem which he had set himself to unravel .",15

"as he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and placed it in front of the terrier , who speedily licked it dry . sherlock holmes ' earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in silence , watching the animal intently , and expecting some startling effect . none such appeared , however . the dog continued to lie stretched upon the cushion , breathing in a laboured way , but apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught .",30

"the whole thing occurred in a moment â€” so quickly that i had no time to realize it . i have a vivid recollection of that instant , of holmes ' triumphant expression and the ring of his voice , of the cabman 's dazed , savage face , as he glared at the glittering handcuffs , which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists . for a second or two we might have been a group of statues . then , with an inarticulate roar of fury , the prisoner wrenched himself free from holmes 's grasp , and hurled himself through the window . woodwork and glass gave way before him ; but before he got quite through , gregson , lestrade , and holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds . he was dragged back into the room , and then commenced a terrific conflict . so powerful and so fierce was he , that the four of us were shaken off again and again . he appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit . his face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass , but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance . it was not until lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and half - strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail ; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his hands . that done , we rose to our feet breathless and panting .",128
