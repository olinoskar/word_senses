"she was now not more than two miles off , and exactly opposite the plateau of prospect heights , for after having tacked off claw cape , she had drifted towards the north in the current of the rising tide .",39
"i waited till the last deep and full vibration had expired -- till the tide of talk , checked an instant , had resumed its flow ; i then quitted my sheltered corner and made my exit by the side - door , which was fortunately near .",14
""" he says tide , "" said my uncle , translating the danish word .",3
""" the truest love that ever heart felt at its kindled core , did through each vein , in quickened start , the tide of being pour .",23
"by then it was three o'clock in the afternoon . the current was slacking off , it was almost full tide . the nautilus drew near this island , which i can see to this day with its remarkable fringe of screw pines . we hugged it from less than two miles out . a sudden jolt threw me down . the nautilus had just struck a reef , and it remained motionless , listing slightly to port .",20
"here is what those circumstances entailed . two miles to starboard lay gueboroa island , its coastline curving north to west like an immense arm . to the south and east , heads of coral were already on display , left uncovered by the ebbing waters . we had run aground at full tide and in one of those seas whose tides are moderate , an inconvenient state of affairs for floating the nautilus off . however , the ship had n't suffered in any way , so solidly joined was its hull . but although it could neither sink nor split open , it was in serious danger of being permanently attached to these reefs , and that would have been the finish of captain nemo 's submersible .",53
""" there now ! "" said holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white with vexation from the tide of vehicles . "" was ever such bad luck and such bad management , too ? watson , watson , if you are an honest man you will record this also and set it against my successes ! """,18
"the waters of the mercy flowed under a roof of ice , which , at each rising and ebbing of the tide , broke up with loud crashes .",21
"it took the whole day to reach the promontory , for the vessel on leaving port had only two hours of ebb tide and had therefore to make way for six hours against the flood .",22
"pencroft was radiant with joy , the operation was perfectly successful ; the boat completely rigged , having been pushed on rollers to the water 's edge , was floated by the rising tide , amid the cheers of the colonists , particularly of pencroft , who showed no modesty on this occasion .",33
"i am afraid that it will be very difficult to get in , having both wind and tide against us . """,17
"as soon as the "" bonadventure "" had been lifted by the rising tide , it was seen that she lay evenly in the water , and would be easily navigated .",13
""" you may say so , uncle ; but to me it is most extraordinary , and i can hardly believe my eyes . who would ever have imagined , under this terrestrial crust , an ocean with ebbing and flowing tides , with winds and storms ? """,41
"so the skiff did n't leave shipside that day , much to the displeasure of mr . land who could n't complete his provisions . the adroit canadian spent his time preparing the meat and flour products he had brought from gueboroa island . as for the savages , they went back to shore near eleven o'clock in the morning , when the heads of coral began to disappear under the waves of the rising tide . but i saw their numbers swell considerably on the beach . it was likely that they had come from neighboring islands or from the mainland of papua proper . however , i did n't see one local dugout canoe .",75
""" because this liquid mass would be subject , like the ocean , to the lunar attraction , and therefore twice every day there would be internal tides , which , upheaving the terrestrial crust , would cause periodical earthquakes ! """,27
"he chose a clear place on the shore , which the ebbing tide had left perfectly level .",12
"three hours later at low tide , the greater part of the sand forming the bed of the channel was uncovered .",5
"the human tide now swept by , after overturning fix , who speedily got upon his feet again , though with tattered clothes . happily , he was not seriously hurt . his travelling overcoat was divided into two unequal parts , and his trousers resembled those of certain indians , which fit less compactly than they are easy to put on . aouda had escaped unharmed , and fix alone bore marks of the fray in his black and blue bruise .",2
"however , herbert , who had gone forward a little more to the left , soon came upon rocks covered with sea - weed , which , some hours later , would be hidden by the high tide .",37
"the vessel was securely moored , so that there should be no danger of her being carried away by the receding tide ; then pencroft and his companions , well armed , ascended the shore , so as to gain an elevation of about two hundred and fifty or three hundred feet which rose at a distance of half a mile .",21
"meanwhile , crazed with terror , the unhinged papuans beat a retreat . as for us , half laughing , we massaged and comforted poor ned land , who was swearing like one possessed . but just then , lifted off by the tide 's final undulations , the nautilus left its coral bed at exactly that fortieth minute pinpointed by the captain . its propeller churned the waves with lazy majesty . gathering speed little by little , the ship navigated on the surface of the ocean , and safe and sound , it left behind the dangerous narrows of the torres strait .",43
"the chimneys would have been quite insufficient to protect them against the rigor of winter , and it was to be feared that the high tides would make another irruption .",25
"for several hours the nautilus drifted in this brilliant tide , and our wonderment grew when we saw huge marine animals cavorting in it , like the fire - dwelling salamanders of myth . in the midst of these flames that did n't burn , i could see swift , elegant porpoises , the tireless pranksters of the seas , and sailfish three meters long , those shrewd heralds of hurricanes , whose fearsome broadswords sometimes banged against the lounge window . then smaller fish appeared : miscellaneous triggerfish , leather jacks , unicornfish , and a hundred others that left stripes on this luminous atmosphere in their course .",9
"but it was not necessary to wait for the tide to bring up these riches , and ayrton and pencroft jumped into the boat with the intention of towing the pieces of wreck either to the beach or to the islet .",9
"trains , like time and tide , stop for no one . the gentleman who uttered the cries was evidently a belated mormon . he was breathless with running . happily for him , the station had neither gates nor barriers . he rushed along the track , jumped on the rear platform of the train , and fell , exhausted , into one of the seats .",5
"when a corpse floats a little distance from a low shore , it rarely happens that the tide does not throw it up , sooner or later .",17
"the sea was calm and the tide very high , as there had been a new moon but two days before .",6
""" no , "" replied neb , "" only above high - water mark , for the others must have been washed out by the tide . """,25
"they had to profit by the low tide to cross the channel , and it was agreed that they would construct , for this purpose , as well as they could , a boat which would render communication so much easier , and would also permit them to ascend the mercy , at the time of their grand exploration of the southwest of the island , which was put off till the first fine days .",7
"in the meanwhile , the monster thus stranded did not move , nor attempt by struggling to regain the water while the tide was still high .",22
"the canoe followed the windings of the shore , avoiding the rocks which fringed it , and which the rising tide began to cover .",20
"there the shore was low , flat , without cliffs , and with great banks of sand , which the tide left uncovered .",20
"it was just at high - water when these people came on shore ; and while they rambled about to see what kind of a place they were in , they had carelessly stayed till the tide was spent , and the water was ebbed considerably away , leaving their boat aground . they had left two men in the boat , who , as i found afterwards , having drunk a little too much brandy , fell asleep ; however , one of them waking a little sooner than the other and finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it , hallooed out for the rest , who were straggling about : upon which they all soon came to the boat : but it was past all their strength to launch her , the boat being very heavy , and the shore on that side being a soft oozy sand , almost like a quicksand . in this condition , like true seamen , who are , perhaps , the least of all mankind given to forethought , they gave it over , and away they strolled about the country again ; and i heard one of them say aloud to another , calling them off from the boat , “ why , let her alone , jack , ca n’t you ? she ’ll float next tide ; ” by which i was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of what countrymen they were .",231
the tide had already turned . they must now avail themselves of the ebb to take the wood to the mouth .,1
""" the tide is high .",2
"several hours had passed during these researches , and the tide began to flow .",10
""" look here , the tide is going down , "" said herbert ; "" let 's run to the place where we landed . """,5
