"it was a warm june morning , and the latter day saints were as busy as the bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem . in the fields and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry . down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavily - laden mules , all heading to the west , for the gold fever had broken out in california , and the overland route lay through the city of the elect . there , too , were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands , and trains of tired immigrants , men and horses equally weary of their interminable journey . through all this motley assemblage , threading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider , there galloped lucy ferrier , her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out behind her . she had a commission from her father in the city , and was dashing in as she had done many a time before , with all the fearlessness of youth , thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed . the travel - stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment , and even the unemotional indians , journeying in with their pelties , relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale - faced maiden .",126
"as soon as i was dressed , i made my way to the main lounge . it was deserted . i dove into studying the conchological treasures amassed inside the glass cases . i also investigated the huge plant albums that were filled with the rarest marine herbs , which , although they were pressed and dried , still kept their wonderful colors . among these valuable water plants , i noted various seaweed : some cladostephus verticillatus , peacock 's tails , fig - leafed caulerpa , grain - bearing beauty bushes , delicate rosetangle tinted scarlet , sea colander arranged into fan shapes , mermaid 's cups that looked like the caps of squat mushrooms and for years had been classified among the zoophytes ; in short , a complete series of algae .",10
"just at this moment there was an unusual stir in the human mass . all the hands were raised in the air . some , tightly closed , seemed to disappear suddenly in the midst of the cries -- an energetic way , no doubt , of casting a vote . the crowd swayed back , the banners and flags wavered , disappeared an instant , then reappeared in tatters . the undulations of the human surge reached the steps , while all the heads floundered on the surface like a sea agitated by a squall . many of the black hats disappeared , and the greater part of the crowd seemed to have diminished in height .",41

"i assented gladly , and we all descended together . our prisoner made no attempt at escape , but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his , and we followed him . lestrade mounted the box , whipped up the horse , and brought us in a very short time to our destination . we were ushered into a small chamber where a police inspector noted down our prisoner 's name and the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged . the official was a white - faced unemotional man , who went through his duties in a dull mechanical way .
