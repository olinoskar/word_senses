"and there we were , climbing these blackish rocks amid sudden landslides and over stones slippery with ice . more than once i took a tumble at the expense of my backside . conseil , more cautious or more stable , barely faltered and would help me up , saying :",5
"followed by captain nemo , i climbed onto the platform , and from there my eyes eagerly scanned the horizon .",6
""" yes , since those poor fishermen ca n't stay long underwater . on his voyage to ceylon , the englishman percival made much of a kaffir who stayed under five minutes without coming up to the surface , but i find that hard to believe . i know that some divers can last up to fifty - seven seconds , and highly skillful ones to eighty - seven ; but such men are rare , and when the poor fellows climb back on board , the water coming out of their noses and ears is tinted with blood . i believe the average time underwater that these fishermen can tolerate is thirty seconds , during which they hastily stuff their little nets with all the pearl oysters they can tear loose . but these fishermen generally do n't live to advanced age : their vision weakens , ulcers break out on their eyes , sores form on their bodies , and some are even stricken with apoplexy on the ocean floor . """,81
"by nine o'clock we had pulled up to shore . the sky was growing brighter . clouds were fleeing to the south . mists were rising from the cold surface of the water . captain nemo headed toward the peak , which he no doubt planned to make his observatory . it was an arduous climb over sharp lava and pumice stones in the midst of air often reeking with sulfurous fumes from the smoke holes . for a man out of practice at treading land , the captain scaled the steepest slopes with a supple agility i could n't equal , and which would have been envied by hunters of pyrenees mountain goats .",55
"i stared at the last rays wreathing this peak , while shadows were gradually climbing its gradients . just then , resting his hand on my shoulder , captain nemo said to me :",14
"they continued then to follow the shores of lake grant by climbing the plateau ; but , after having gone a mile in this direction , cyrus harding had not been able to discover the overfall , which , however , must exist somewhere .",11
"no ; a more material interest stirred his blood . he was about at last to pass that mysterious threshold , to climb those unknown stairs by which , one by one , the old crowns of m. coquenard had ascended .",22
"at some places the flanks of the mountain formed an angle with the horizon of at least 36 degrees ; it was impossible to climb them , and these stony cliffs had to be tacked round , not without great difficulty . then we helped each other with our sticks .",24
"i must admit that my uncle kept as close to me as he could ; he never lost sight of me , and in many straits his arm furnished me with a powerful support . he himself seemed to possess an instinct for equilibrium , for he never stumbled . the icelanders , though burdened with our loads , climbed with the agility of mountaineers .",59
"frantic , i rushed into the library . i climbed the central companionway , and going along the upper gangway , i arrived at the skiff . i went through the opening that had already given access to my two companions .",9
"yet hans did not think it prudent to spend the night upon the sides of the cone . we continued our zigzag climb . the fifteen hundred remaining feet took us five hours to clear ; the circuitous route , the diagonal and the counter marches , must have measured at least three leagues . i could stand it no longer . i was yielding to the effects of hunger and cold . the rarefied air scarcely gave play to the action of my lungs .",22
"and i too could feel the difference created by the water 's powerful density -- despite my heavy clothing , copper headpiece , and metal soles , i climbed the most impossibly steep gradients with all the nimbleness , i swear it , of a chamois or a pyrenees mountain goat !",28
"i climbed as far as the hatch . it was open . but instead of the broad daylight i was expecting , i found that i was surrounded by total darkness . where were we ? had i been mistaken ? was it still night ? no ! not one star was twinkling , and nighttime is never so utterly black .",1
"several times , one or other of the settlers descended to the beach in the midst of ice which the waves heaped up at each tide , but they soon climbed up again to granite house , and it was not without pain and difficulty that their hands could hold to the rounds of the ladder .",30
"our visit to this opulent giant clam came to an end . captain nemo left the cave , and we climbed back up the bank of shellfish in the midst of these clear waters not yet disturbed by divers at work .",20
""" no more than i could exit through it . you can climb about 100 feet up the inner base of this mountain , but then the walls overhang , they lean too far in to be scaled . """,12
"the ground rose appreciably as it moved away from the sand flats by the waves , and we soon arrived at some long , winding gradients , genuinely steep paths that allowed us to climb little by little ; but we had to tread cautiously in the midst of pudding stones that were n't cemented together , and our feet kept skidding on glassy trachyte , made of feldspar and quartz crystals .",34
"cyrus harding had almost entirely recovered his strength , and had proved it by climbing to the upper plateau .",14
"but when we had ascended to an elevation of about 250 feet , we were stopped by insurmountable obstacles . the converging inside walls changed into overhangs , and our climb into a circular stroll . at this topmost level the vegetable kingdom began to challenge the mineral kingdom . shrubs , and even a few trees , emerged from crevices in the walls . i recognized some spurges that let their caustic , purgative sap trickle out . there were heliotropes , very remiss at living up to their sun - worshipping reputations since no sunlight ever reached them ; their clusters of flowers drooped sadly , their colors and scents were faded . here and there chrysanthemums sprouted timidly at the feet of aloes with long , sad , sickly leaves . but between these lava flows i spotted little violets that still gave off a subtle fragrance , and i confess that i inhaled it with delight . the soul of a flower is its scent , and those splendid water plants , flowers of the sea , have no souls !",30
"it might even have been said that he did not observe the country at all , either in its configuration or in its natural productions , his great aim being to climb the mountain before him , and therefore straight towards it he went .",31
"master jup aided them dexterously , either by climbing to the top of a tree to fasten the ropes or by lending his stout shoulders to carry the lopped trunks .",8
"i made my way to the central companionway , which led to the platform . i climbed its metal steps , passed through the open hatches , and arrived topside on the nautilus .",16
"at noon that day after our position fix , captain nemo climbed onto the platform , where i happened to be . i vowed not to let him go below again without at least sounding him out on his future plans . as soon as he saw me , he came over , graciously offered me a cigar , and said to me :",11
"after leaving the region of bushes , the party , assisted by resting on each other 's shoulders , climbed for about a hundred feet up a steep acclivity and reached a level place , with very few trees , where the soil appeared volcanic .",19
"i climbed onto the platform . night had already fallen , because in this low latitude the sun sets quickly , without any twilight . i could see gueboroa island only dimly . but numerous fires had been kindled on the beach , attesting that the natives had no thoughts of leaving it .",1
"felton jumped onshore , climbed the little ascent which led to the top of the cliff , saluted milady a last time , and took his course toward the city .",4
"the next day , the 7th of may , harding and gideon spilett , leaving neb to prepare breakfast , climbed prospect heights , while herbert and pencroft ascended by the river , to renew their store of wood .",20

"just then , as mute and emotionless as ever , seven crewmen climbed onto the platform . one carried a harpoon and line similar to those used in whale fishing . its deck paneling opened , the skiff was wrenched from its socket and launched to sea . six rowers sat on the thwarts , and the coxswain took the tiller . ned , conseil , and i found seats in the stern .",12
"arrived at the foot of the hill , pencroft , spilett , and herbert climbed it in a few minutes , and gazed anxiously round the horizon .",14
"neb , herbert , and the sailor , climbing to the summit of the tree , used all their skill to disengage the now reduced balloon .",8
"captain nemo guided the nautilus next to the animal 's corpse . two of his men climbed onto the whale 's flank , and to my astonishment , i saw them draw from its udders all the milk they held , in other words , enough to fill two or three casks .",16
"after a while , finding that nothing more happened , she decided on going into the garden at once ; but , alas for poor alice ! when she got to the door , she found she had forgotten the little golden key , and when she went back to the table for it , she found she could not possibly reach it : she could see it quite plainly through the glass , and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table , but it was too slippery ; and when she had tired herself out with trying , the poor little thing sat down and cried .",80
"to avoid it the colonists had been obliged to make a considerable detour , by climbing up to the source of the red creek .",15
"after renewing its air , the nautilus stayed at an average depth of fifteen meters , enabling it to return quickly to the surface of the waves . and , contrary to custom , it executed such a maneuver several times during that day of january 19 . the chief officer would then climb onto the platform , and his usual phrase would ring through the ship 's interior .",53
""" and a staircase to climb up to them ! "" added neb .",5
"cyrus harding and his companions then climbed the spur rising between the corral valley and that of falls river , which they crossed at its narrowest part .",6
the tree was easy to climb .,5
"finally , at around four o'clock , this marvelous excursion came to an end . a wall of superb rocks stood before us , imposing in its sheer mass : a pile of gigantic stone blocks , an enormous granite cliffside pitted with dark caves but not offering a single gradient we could climb up . this was the underpinning of crespo island . this was land .",53
"the engineer now proposed to his companions to climb the slope , and to return to the chimneys by the heights , while exploring the northern and eastern shores of the lake .",8
"by the next morning , november 18 , i was fully recovered from my exhaustion of the day before , and i climbed onto the platform just as the nautilus 's chief officer was pronouncing his daily phrase . it then occurred to me that these words either referred to the state of the sea , or that they meant : "" there 's nothing in sight . """,22
"our dwelling has been invaded by monkeys , who climbed up the ladder during our absence . """,9
"after changing clothes , i climbed onto the platform , and in the grip of dreadfully obsessive thoughts , i sat next to the beacon .",5

"that day , january 21 , 1868 , the chief officer went at noon to take the sun 's altitude . i climbed onto the platform , lit a cigar , and watched him at work . it seemed obvious to me that this man did n't understand french , because i made several remarks in a loud voice that were bound to provoke him to some involuntary show of interest had he understood them ; but he remained mute and emotionless .",22
