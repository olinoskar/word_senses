"i feel peculiar sensations , like many creatures on earth at the approach of violent atmospheric changes . the heavily voluted cumulus clouds lower gloomily and threateningly ; they wear that implacable look which i have sometimes noticed at the outbreak of a great storm . the air is heavy ; the sea is calm .",7
"how strange a chequer - work of providence is the life of man ! and by what secret different springs are the affections hurried about , as different circumstances present ! to - day we love what to - morrow we hate ; to - day we seek what to - morrow we shun ; to - day we desire what to - morrow we fear , nay , even tremble at the apprehensions of . this was exemplified in me , at this time , in the most lively manner imaginable ; for i , whose only affliction was that i seemed banished from human society , that i was alone , circumscribed by the boundless ocean , cut off from mankind , and condemned to what i call silent life ; that i was as one whom heaven thought not worthy to be numbered among the living , or to appear among the rest of his creatures ; that to have seen one of my own species would have seemed to me a raising me from death to life , and the greatest blessing that heaven itself , next to the supreme blessing of salvation , could bestow ; i say , that i should now tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a man , and was ready to sink into the ground at but the shadow or silent appearance of a man having set his foot in the island .",158
"when i was come down the hill to the shore , as i said above , being the sw . point of the island , i was perfectly confounded and amazed ; nor is it possible for me to express the horror of my mind at seeing the shore spread with skulls , hands , feet , and other bones of human bodies ; and particularly i observed a place where there had been a fire made , and a circle dug in the earth , like a cockpit , where i supposed the savage wretches had sat down to their human feastings upon the bodies of their fellow - creatures .",110
"in my excursion i met but few people . on returning to the main street i found the greater part of the population busied in drying , salting , and putting on board codfish , their chief export . the men looked like robust but heavy , blond germans with pensive eyes , conscious of being far removed from their fellow creatures , poor exiles relegated to this land of ice , poor creatures who should have been esquimaux , since nature had condemned them to live only just outside the arctic circle ! in vain did i try to detect a smile upon their lips ; sometimes by a spasmodic and involuntary contraction of the muscles they seemed to laugh , but they never smiled .",61

"a small fly or moth had fluttered across our path , and in an instant stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it . to my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire , and my acquaintance never paused for an instant , bounding from tuft to tuft behind it , his green net waving in the air . his gray clothes and jerky , zigzag , irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself . i was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the treacherous mire , when i heard the sound of steps , and turning round found a woman near me upon the path . she had come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of merripit house , but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close .",32
"d’artagnan did the same , with a little more concern , however , for the noble creatures , whose merits he fully appreciated ; but he had the satisfaction of seeing three or four grooms run from the kitchens and the stables , and busy themselves with the steeds .",16
"some hundreds of birds lived there nestled in the holes of the stone ; herbert , jumping over the rocks , startled a whole flock of these winged creatures .",28
"it was high time to go , for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it : there were a duck and a dodo , a lory and an eaglet , and several other curious creatures . alice led the way , and the whole party swam to the shore .",43

"it was happy for the poor man that it was my man friday ; for , having been used to such creatures in his country , he had no fear upon him , but went close up to him and shot him ; whereas , any other of us would have fired at a farther distance , and have perhaps either missed the wolf or endangered shooting the man .",21
"we did so , and it was well we did ; for never was a more furious charge than the creatures made upon us in this place . they came on with a growling kind of noise , and mounted the piece of timber , which , as i said , was our breastwork , as if they were only rushing upon their prey ; and this fury of theirs , it seems , was principally occasioned by their seeing our horses behind us . i ordered our men to fire as before , every other man ; and they took their aim so sure that they killed several of the wolves at the first volley ; but there was a necessity to keep a continual firing , for they came on like devils , those behind pushing on those before .",20
"we had , first and last , killed about threescore of them , and had it been daylight we had killed many more . the field of battle being thus cleared , we made forward again , for we had still near a league to go . we heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the woods as we went several times , and sometimes we fancied we saw some of them ; but the snow dazzling our eyes , we were not certain . in about an hour more we came to the town where we were to lodge , which we found in a terrible fright and all in arms ; for , it seems , the night before the wolves and some bears had broken into the village , and put them in such terror that they were obliged to keep guard night and day , but especially in the night , to preserve their cattle , and indeed their people .",51
"our lights produced a thousand delightful effects while playing over these brightly colored boughs . i fancied i saw these cylindrical , membrane - filled tubes trembling beneath the water 's undulations . i was tempted to gather their fresh petals , which were adorned with delicate tentacles , some newly in bloom , others barely opened , while nimble fish with fluttering fins brushed past them like flocks of birds . but if my hands came near the moving flowers of these sensitive , lively creatures , an alarm would instantly sound throughout the colony . the white petals retracted into their red sheaths , the flowers vanished before my eyes , and the bush changed into a chunk of stony nipples .",86

"among other fowl i noted some sheathbills from the wading - bird family , the size of pigeons , white in color , the beak short and conical , the eyes framed by red circles . conseil laid in a supply of them , because when they 're properly cooked , these winged creatures make a pleasant dish . in the air there passed sooty albatross with four - meter wingspans , birds aptly dubbed "" vultures of the ocean , "" also gigantic petrels including several with arching wings , enthusiastic eaters of seal that are known as quebrantahuesos , and cape pigeons , a sort of small duck , the tops of their bodies black and white -- in short , a whole series of petrels , some whitish with wings trimmed in brown , others blue and exclusive to these antarctic seas , the former "" so oily , "" i told conseil , "" that inhabitants of the faroe islands simply fit the bird with a wick , then light it up .
