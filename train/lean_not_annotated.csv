"on leaving rejkiavik hans took us by the seashore . we passed lean pastures which were trying very hard , but in vain , to look green ; yellow came out best . the rugged peaks of the trachyte rocks presented faint outlines on the eastern horizon ; at times a few patches of snow , concentrating the vague light , glittered upon the slopes of the distant mountains ; certain peaks , boldly uprising , passed through the grey clouds , and reappeared above the moving mists , like breakers emerging in the heavens .",12
"passing near these unusual animals , i could examine them at my leisure since they did n't stir . their hides were rough and heavy , a tan color leaning toward a reddish brown ; their coats were short and less than abundant . some were four meters long . more tranquil and less fearful than their northern relatives , they posted no sentinels on guard duty at the approaches to their campsite .",29

"leaning against the walls , i dragged myself down the gangways to the lounge , whose ceiling lights were on . the furniture had been knocked over . fortunately the glass cases were solidly secured at the base and had stood fast . since we were no longer vertical , the starboard pictures were glued to the tapestries , while those to port had their lower edges hanging a foot away from the wall . so the nautilus was lying on its starboard side , completely stationary to boot .",0

"as i mused in this way , trying to establish in my memory every detail of this impressive landscape , captain nemo was leaning his elbows on a moss - covered monument , motionless as if petrified in some mute trance . was he dreaming of those lost generations , asking them for the secret of human destiny ? was it here that this strange man came to revive himself , basking in historical memories , reliving that bygone life , he who had no desire for our modern one ? i would have given anything to know his thoughts , to share them , understand them !",23
"then came a new development . i had drawn you as paris in dainty armour , and as adonis with huntsman 's cloak and polished boar- spear . crowned with heavy lotus - blossoms you had sat on the prow of adrian 's barge , gazing across the green turbid nile . you had leaned over the still pool of some greek woodland and seen in the water 's silent silver the marvel of your own face . and it had all been what art should be -- unconscious , ideal , and remote . one day , a fatal day i sometimes think , i determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are , not in the costume of dead ages , but in your own dress and in your own time . whether it was the realism of the method , or the mere wonder of your own personality , thus directly presented to me without mist or veil , i can not tell . but i know that as i worked at it , every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret .",54

"just then i was in the bow , leaning over the starboard rail . conseil , stationed beside me , stared straight ahead . roosting in the shrouds , the crew examined the horizon , which shrank and darkened little by little . officers were probing the increasing gloom with their night glasses . sometimes the murky ocean sparkled beneath moonbeams that darted between the fringes of two clouds . then all traces of light vanished into the darkness .",8

"the young man was leaning against the mantelshelf , watching him with that strange expression that one sees on the faces of those who are absorbed in a play when some great artist is acting . there was neither real sorrow in it nor real joy . there was simply the passion of the spectator , with perhaps a flicker of triumph in his eyes . he had taken the flower out of his coat , and was smelling it , or pretending to do so .",4

"just then the chief officer drew the captain 's attention anew . the latter interrupted his strolling and aimed his spyglass at the point indicated . he observed it a good while . as for me , deeply puzzled , i went below to the lounge and brought back an excellent long - range telescope i habitually used . leaning my elbows on the beacon housing , which jutted from the stern of the platform , i got set to scour that whole stretch of sky and sea . but no sooner had i peered into the eyepiece than the instrument was snatched from my hands .",59

"none of the weeds carpeting the seafloor , none of the branches bristling from the shrubbery , crept , or leaned , or stretched on a horizontal plane . they all rose right up toward the surface of the ocean . every filament or ribbon , no matter how thin , stood ramrod straight . fucus plants and creepers were growing in stiff perpendicular lines , governed by the density of the element that generated them . after i parted them with my hands , these otherwise motionless plants would shoot right back to their original positions . it was the regime of verticality .",20
