"during the magnificent evening of june 25 - -in other words , three weeks after our departure -- the frigate lay abreast of cabo blanco , thirty miles to leeward of the coast of patagonia . we had crossed the tropic of capricorn , and the strait of magellan opened less than 700 miles to the south . before eight days were out , the abraham lincoln would plow the waves of the pacific .",3

"two days passed . the abraham lincoln stayed at half steam . on the offchance that the animal might be found in these waterways , a thousand methods were used to spark its interest or rouse it from its apathy . enormous sides of bacon were trailed in our wake , to the great satisfaction , i must say , of assorted sharks . while the abraham lincoln heaved to , its longboats radiated in every direction around it and did n't leave a single point of the sea unexplored . but the evening of november 4 arrived with this underwater mystery still unsolved .",93
"the king was closeted with the cardinal , and m. de treville was informed that the king was busy and could not receive him at that moment . in the evening m. de treville attended the king â€™s gaming table .",30
"evening came on by degrees , and it was almost night when cyrus harding and his companions , much fatigued by an ascent of seven hours , arrived at the plateau of the first cone .",0

"the train entered the defiles of the sutpour mountains , which separate the khandeish from bundelcund , towards evening . the next day sir francis cromarty asked passepartout what time it was ; to which , on consulting his watch , he replied that it was three in the morning . this famous timepiece , always regulated on the greenwich meridian , which was now some seventy - seven degrees westward , was at least four hours slow . sir francis corrected passepartout 's time , whereupon the latter made the same remark that he had done to fix ; and upon the general insisting that the watch should be regulated in each new meridian , since he was constantly going eastward , that is in the face of the sun , and therefore the days were shorter by four minutes for each degree gone over , passepartout obstinately refused to alter his watch , which he kept at london time . it was an innocent delusion which could harm no one .",18
cyrus harding followed the same road as the evening before .,8
"perhaps , on climbing again to the summit of the cone , cyrus harding had had a hope of discovering some coast , some island shore , which he had not been able to perceive in the dark the evening before .",39
"the fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface from our minds the grim and gray impression which had been left upon both of us by our first experience of baskerville hall . as sir henry and i sat at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through the high mullioned windows , throwing watery patches of colour from the coats of arms which covered them . the dark panelling glowed like bronze in the golden rays , and it was hard to realize that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such a gloom into our souls upon the evening before .",101

"the dog came bounding back , and seeing his master in a predicament , and hearing the horse groan , barked till the evening hills echoed the sound , which was deep in proportion to his magnitude .",23

"there was a silence . the evening darkened in the room . noiselessly , and with silver feet , the shadows crept in from the garden . the colours faded wearily out of things .",6
"if a gust of wind swept the waste , i looked up , fearing it was the rush of a bull ; if a plover whistled , i imagined it a man . finding my apprehensions unfounded , however , and calmed by the deep silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall , i took confidence .",49
"the work lasted all day , and it was not till the evening that they set fire to the fagots .",12

"he felt that the man must be got rid of at once . he must not be allowed to know where the picture was being taken to . there was something sly about him , and he had thoughtful , treacherous eyes . sitting down at the writing - table he scribbled a note to lord henry , asking him to send him round something to read and reminding him that they were to meet at eight - fifteen that evening .",80
it was now necessary to complete the observations of the evening before by measuring the height of the cliff above the level of the sea .,10
"he sighed , and having poured himself out some tea , opened lord henry 's note . it was simply to say that he sent him round the evening paper , and a book that might interest him , and that he would be at the club at eight - fifteen . he opened the st . james 's languidly , and looked through it . a red pencil - mark on the fifth page caught his eye . it drew attention to the following paragraph :",28

"the steamer lay puffing alongside the quay , on the point of starting . passepartout had but few steps to go ; and , rushing upon the plank , he crossed it , and fell unconscious on the deck , just as the carnatic was moving off . several sailors , who were evidently accustomed to this sort of scene , carried the poor frenchman down into the second cabin , and passepartout did not wake until they were one hundred and fifty miles away from china . thus he found himself the next morning on the deck of the carnatic , and eagerly inhaling the exhilarating sea - breeze . the pure air sobered him . he began to collect his sense , which he found a difficult task ; but at last he recalled the events of the evening before , fix 's revelation , and the opium - house .",140
"cyrus harding then took the instrument which he had made the evening before , the space between its two legs giving the angular distance between the star alpha and the horizon .",11
"the nautilus passed over these lush , luxuriant depths with tremendous speed . near evening it approached the falkland islands , whose rugged summits i recognized the next day . the sea was of moderate depth . so not without good reason , i assumed that these two islands , plus the many islets surrounding them , used to be part of the magellan coastline . the falkland islands were probably discovered by the famous navigator john davis , who gave them the name davis southern islands . later sir richard hawkins called them the maidenland , after the blessed virgin . subsequently , at the beginning of the 18th century , they were named the malouines by fishermen from saint - malo in brittany , then finally dubbed the falklands by the english , to whom they belong today .",14

"during the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles , and by evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from their enemies . at night - time they chose the base of a beetling crag , where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind , and there huddled together for warmth , they enjoyed a few hours ' sleep . before daybreak , however , they were up and on their way once more . they had seen no signs of any pursuers , and jefferson hope began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose enmity they had incurred . he little knew how far that iron grasp could reach , or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them .",15
