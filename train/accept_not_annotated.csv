""" gentlemen , "" said d’artagnan , addressing the guardsmen , "" you may easily comprehend that such a feast can only be very dull after what has taken place ; so accept my excuses , and put off the party till another day , i beg of you . """,32

"the relevant data on this apparition , as recorded in various logbooks , agreed pretty closely as to the structure of the object or creature in question , its unprecedented speed of movement , its startling locomotive power , and the unique vitality with which it seemed to be gifted . if it was a cetacean , it exceeded in bulk any whale previously classified by science . no naturalist , neither cuvier nor lacépède , neither professor dumeril nor professor de quatrefages , would have accepted the existence of such a monster sight unseen-- specifically , unseen by their own scientific eyes .",86
""" i believe you will accept the post i offer you , "" said he , "" and hold it for a while : not permanently , though : any more than i could permanently keep the narrow and narrowing -- the tranquil , hidden office of english country incumbent ; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to repose as that in mine , though of a different kind .

"in every big city the monster was the latest rage ; they sang about it in the coffee houses , they ridiculed it in the newspapers , they dramatized it in the theaters . the tabloids found it a fine opportunity for hatching all sorts of hoaxes . in those newspapers short of copy , you saw the reappearance of every gigantic imaginary creature , from "" moby dick , "" that dreadful white whale from the high arctic regions , to the stupendous kraken whose tentacles could entwine a 500-ton craft and drag it into the ocean depths . they even reprinted reports from ancient times : the views of aristotle and pliny accepting the existence of such monsters , then the norwegian stories of bishop pontoppidan , the narratives of paul egede , and finally the reports of captain harrington-- whose good faith is above suspicion -- in which he claims he saw , while aboard the castilian in 1857 , one of those enormous serpents that , until then , had frequented only the seas of france 's old extremist newspaper , the constitutionalist .",114
"as the dawn was just breaking , he found himself close to covent garden . the darkness lifted , and , flushed with faint fires , the sky hollowed itself into a perfect pearl . huge carts filled with nodding lilies rumbled slowly down the polished empty street . the air was heavy with the perfume of the flowers , and their beauty seemed to bring him an anodyne for his pain . he followed into the market and watched the men unloading their waggons . a white - smocked carter offered him some cherries . he thanked him , wondered why he refused to accept any money for them , and began to eat them listlessly . they had been plucked at midnight , and the coldness of the moon had entered into them .",105
"although milady would very willingly have gone without sleep , sustained as she was by all the excitements which a new adventure awakened in her heart , ever thirsting for intrigues , she nevertheless accepted the offer of the superior . during the last fifteen days she had experienced so many and such various emotions that if her frame of iron was still capable of supporting fatigue , her mind required repose .",34

"already , forgetting his carnivorous instincts , the stranger accepted a less bestial nourishment than that on which he fed on the islet , and cooked meat did not produce in him the same sentiment of repulsion which he had showed on board the "" bonadventure . """,9

"just at sunset , the air turned cold and the sky cloudy : i went in , sophie called me upstairs to look at my wedding - dress , which they had just brought ; and under it in the box i found your present -- the veil which , in your princely extravagance , you sent for from london : resolved , i suppose , since i would not have jewels , to cheat me into accepting something as costly .",77

"first division in the polyp group , the class spongiaria has been created by scientists precisely for this unusual exhibit whose usefulness is beyond dispute . the sponge is definitely not a plant , as some naturalists still believe , but an animal of the lowest order , a polypary inferior even to coral . its animal nature is n't in doubt , and we ca n't accept even the views of the ancients , who regarded it as halfway between plant and animal . but i must say that naturalists are not in agreement on the structural mode of sponges . for some it 's a polypary , and for others , such as professor milne - edwards , it 's a single , solitary individual .",67

"the girl blushed ; the theatin accepted the invitation and she followed him , eyeing candide every now and then with a mixture of surprise and confusion , while the tears stole down her cheeks .",6
"if we accept the hypotheses of the microbiologist ehrenberg-- who believes that these underwater depths are lit up by phosphorescent organisms -- nature has certainly saved one of her most prodigious sights for residents of the sea , and i could judge for myself from the thousandfold play of the light . on both sides i had windows opening over these unexplored depths . the darkness in the lounge enhanced the brightness outside , and we stared as if this clear glass were the window of an immense aquarium .",2
