"when the nautilus returned to the surface of the ocean , i could take in reao island over its whole flat , wooded expanse . obviously its madreporic rocks had been made fertile by tornadoes and thunderstorms . one day , carried off by a hurricane from neighboring shores , some seed fell onto these limestone beds , mixing with decomposed particles of fish and marine plants to form vegetable humus . propelled by the waves , a coconut arrived on this new coast . its germ took root . its tree grew tall , catching steam off the water . a brook was born . little by little , vegetation spread . tiny animals -- worms , insects -- rode ashore on tree trunks snatched from islands to windward . turtles came to lay their eggs . birds nested in the young trees . in this way animal life developed , and drawn by the greenery and fertile soil , man appeared . and that 's how these islands were formed , the immense achievement of microscopic animals .",111

"the thermometer marked -12 degrees centigrade , and a fresh breeze left a sharp nip in the air . ice floes were increasing over the open water . the sea was starting to congeal everywhere . numerous blackish patches were spreading over its surface , announcing the imminent formation of fresh ice . obviously this southernmost basin froze over during its six - month winter and became utterly inaccessible . what happened to the whales during this period ? no doubt they went beneath the ice bank to find more feasible seas . as for seals and walruses , they were accustomed to living in the harshest climates and stayed on in these icy waterways . these animals know by instinct how to gouge holes in the ice fields and keep them continually open ; they go to these holes to breathe . once the birds have migrated northward to escape the cold , these marine mammals remain as sole lords of the polar continent .",40

"but at a later period a wide chasm formed diagonally from south - west to north - east , through which was gradually forced out the trachyte which was to form a mountain chain . no violence accompanied this change ; the matter thrown out was in vast quantities , and the liquid material oozing out from the abysses of the earth slowly spread in extensive plains or in hillocky masses . to this period belong the felspar , syenites , and porphyries .",63

"i made no answer , but went and sat forward . the northern shore was already beginning to dip under the horizon . the eastern and western strands spread wide as if to bid us farewell . before our eyes lay far and wide a vast sea ; shadows of great clouds swept heavily over its silver - grey surface ; the glistening bluish rays of electric light , here and there reflected by the dancing drops of spray , shot out little sheaves of light from the track we left in our rear . soon we entirely lost sight of land ; no object was left for the eye to judge by , and but for the frothy track of the raft , i might have thought we were standing still .",28
