"ayrton is indebted to him as much as we are , for , if it was the stranger who saved me from the waves after the fall from the balloon , evidently it was he who wrote the document , who placed the bottle in the channel , and who has made known to us the situation of our companion .",46
at half - past eight the little band was following the edge of the channel .,14
"but i tell you -- and you may mark my words -- you will come some day to a craggy pass in the channel , where the whole of life 's stream will be broken up into whirl and tumult , foam and noise : either you will be dashed to atoms on crag points , or lifted up and borne on by some master - wave into a calmer current -- as i am now .",23
"however , during the day of march 16 , these tracts of ice completely barred our path . it was n't the ice bank as yet , just huge ice fields cemented together by the cold . this obstacle could n't stop captain nemo , and he launched his ship against the ice fields with hideous violence . the nautilus went into these brittle masses like a wedge , splitting them with dreadful cracklings . it was an old - fashioned battering ram propelled with infinite power . hurled aloft , ice rubble fell back around us like hail . through brute force alone , the submersible carved out a channel for itself . carried away by its momentum , the ship sometimes mounted on top of these tracts of ice and crushed them with its weight , or at other times , when cooped up beneath the ice fields , it split them with simple pitching movements , creating wide punctures .",110
"i was about again to revert to the probability of a union between mr . rochester and the beautiful blanche ; but adele came in , and the conversation was turned into another channel .",33
""" do you want to cross the channel ? "" he asked .",7
"in the meanwhile the "" bonadventure "" entered the winding channels among the reefs , and pencroft observed every turn with extreme care .",10
"the tide being high at that time , rendered the channel impassable .",10
"three hours later at low tide , the greater part of the sand forming the bed of the channel was uncovered .",18
between the islet and the coast there only remained a narrow channel which would no doubt be easy to cross .,11
"it was important to ascertain the channels between the sandbanks and reefs , that buoys might be laid down since this little creek was to be the harbor .",6
"it formed quite a natural harbor , invisible from the sea , and was entered by a narrow channel .",18
"but before the sand had swallowed the heavy things which had fallen through the bottom , ayrton and pencroft , diving to the bed of the channel , recovered the chains and anchors of the brig , the iron of her ballast , and even four guns , which , floated by means of empty casks , were brought to shore .",26
"in an hour we had reached the islet . two hours later we had completed a full circle around it . it measured four to five miles in circumference . a narrow channel separated it from a considerable shore , perhaps a continent whose limits we could n't see . the existence of this shore seemed to bear out commander maury 's hypotheses . in essence , this ingenious american has noted that between the south pole and the 60th parallel , the sea is covered with floating ice of dimensions much greater than any found in the north atlantic . from this fact he drew the conclusion that the antarctic circle must contain considerable shores , since icebergs ca n't form on the high seas but only along coastlines . according to his calculations , this frozen mass enclosing the southernmost pole forms a vast ice cap whose width must reach 4,000 kilometers .",32
"ten days went by in this way . it was only on may 1 that the nautilus openly resumed its northbound course , after raising the bahamas at the mouth of old bahama channel . we then went with the current of the sea 's greatest river , which has its own banks , fish , and temperature . i mean the gulf stream .",33
"from the turning which directed its course to the southwest , the river narrowed gradually and the channel lay between high banks , over which the trees formed a double arch .",17
"it was probable that , having seen their vessel engulfed in the channel , they had fled into the interior of the island .",12
a whole hour at least would elapse before the hull of the brig could emerge from the water of the channel .,20
"yes ! all was explained , everything -- except the presence of the torpedo in the waters of the channel !",19
