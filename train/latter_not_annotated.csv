"the full truth dawned on me . undoubtedly people now knew where they stood on the existence of this so - called monster . undoubtedly the latter 's encounter with the abraham lincoln , when the canadian hit it with his harpoon , had led commander farragut to recognize the narwhale as actually an underwater boat , more dangerous than any unearthly cetacean !",26

"our breakfast - table was cleared early , and holmes waited in his dressing - gown for the promised interview . our clients were punctual to their appointment , for the clock had just struck ten when dr . mortimer was shown up , followed by the young baronet . the latter was a small , alert , dark - eyed man about thirty years of age , very sturdily built , with thick black eyebrows and a strong , pugnacious face . he wore a ruddy - tinted tweed suit and had the weather - beaten appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air , and yet there was something in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated the gentleman .",51
"this caused so rapid and complete a diversion from the attack that d’artagnan ’s adversary , while the latter turned round to face this shower of blows , sheathed his sword with the same precision , and instead of an actor , which he had nearly been , became a spectator of the fight -- a part in which he acquitted himself with his usual impassiveness , muttering , nevertheless , "" a plague upon these gascons !",18

""" it is possible that stapleton did not know of the existence of an heir in canada . in any case he would very soon learn it from his friend dr . mortimer , and he was told by the latter all details about the arrival of henry baskerville . stapleton 's first idea was that this young stranger from canada might possibly be done to death in london without coming down to devonshire at all . he distrusted his wife ever since she had refused to help him in laying a trap for the old man , and he dared not leave her long out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her . it was for this reason that he took her to london with him . they lodged , i find , at the mexborough private hotel , in craven street , which was actually one of those called upon by my agent in search of evidence . here he kept his wife imprisoned in her room while he , disguised in a beard , followed dr . mortimer to baker street and afterwards to the station and to the northumberland hotel . his wife had some inkling of his plans ; but she had such a fear of her husband -- a fear founded upon brutal ill - treatment -- that she dare not write to warn the man whom she knew to be in danger . if the letter should fall into stapleton 's hands her own life would not be safe . eventually , as we know , she adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would form the message , and addressing the letter in a disguised hand . it reached the baronet , and gave him the first warning of his danger .",40

""" in order to steer this boat to port or starboard , in short , to make turns on a horizontal plane , i use an ordinary , wide - bladed rudder that 's fastened to the rear of the sternpost and worked by a wheel and tackle . but i can also move the nautilus upward and downward on a vertical plane by the simple method of slanting its two fins , which are attached to its sides at its center of flotation ; these fins are flexible , able to assume any position , and can be operated from inside by means of powerful levers . if these fins stay parallel with the boat , the latter moves horizontally . if they slant , the nautilus follows the angle of that slant and , under its propeller 's thrust , either sinks on a diagonal as steep as it suits me , or rises on that diagonal . and similarly , if i want to return more swiftly to the surface , i throw the propeller in gear , and the water 's pressure makes the nautilus rise vertically , as an air balloon inflated with hydrogen lifts swiftly into the skies .

"then the nautilus drew near the beaches of africa , where the sea is considerably deeper . there , through the open panels and in a midwater of crystal clarity , our ship enabled us to study wonderful bushes of shining coral and huge chunks of rock wrapped in splendid green furs of algae and fucus . what an indescribable sight , and what a variety of settings and scenery where these reefs and volcanic islands leveled off by the libyan coast ! but soon the nautilus hugged the eastern shore where these tree forms appeared in all their glory . this was off the coast of tihama , and there such zoophyte displays not only flourished below sea level but they also fashioned picturesque networks that unreeled as high as ten fathoms above it ; the latter were more whimsical but less colorful than the former , which kept their bloom thanks to the moist vitality of the waters .",137
"cyrus harding was equally anxious to try the vessel , the model of which had originated with him , although on the sailor 's advice he had altered some parts of it , but he did not share pencroft 's confidence in her , and as the latter had not again spoken of the voyage to tabor island , harding hoped he had given it up .",47

"under this powerful thrust the nautilus 's hull quivered like a resonating chord , and the ship sank steadily under the waters . stationed in the lounge , the captain and i watched the needle swerving swiftly over the pressure gauge . soon we had gone below the livable zone where most fish reside . some of these animals can thrive only at the surface of seas or rivers , but a minority can dwell at fairly great depths . among the latter i observed a species of dogfish called the cow shark that 's equipped with six respiratory slits , the telescope fish with its enormous eyes , the armored gurnard with gray thoracic fins plus black pectoral fins and a breastplate protected by pale red slabs of bone , then finally the grenadier , living at a depth of 1,200 meters , by that point tolerating a pressure of 120 atmospheres .",82

"in the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the sierra blanco . as far as the eye can reach stretches the great flat plain - land , all dusted over with patches of alkali , and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes . on the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks , with their rugged summits flecked with snow . in this great stretch of country there is no sign of life , nor of anything appertaining to life . there is no bird in the steel - blue heaven , no movement upon the dull , grey earth — above all , there is absolute silence . listen as one may , there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness ; nothing but silence — complete and heart - subduing silence . it has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain . that is hardly true . looking down from the sierra blanco , one sees a pathway traced out across the desert , which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance . it is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers . here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun , and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali . approach , and examine them ! they are bones : some large and coarse , others smaller and more delicate . the former have belonged to oxen , and the latter to men . for fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside .",272
"the san francisco steamer was announced to leave that very evening , and it became necessary to find passepartout , if possible , without delay . mr . fogg applied in vain to the french and english consuls , and , after wandering through the streets a long time , began to despair of finding his missing servant . chance , or perhaps a kind of presentiment , at last led him into the honourable mr . batulcar 's theatre . he certainly would not have recognised passepartout in the eccentric mountebank 's costume ; but the latter , lying on his back , perceived his master in the gallery . he could not help starting , which so changed the position of his nose as to bring the "" pyramid "" pell - mell upon the stage .",97
"the train entered the defiles of the sutpour mountains , which separate the khandeish from bundelcund , towards evening . the next day sir francis cromarty asked passepartout what time it was ; to which , on consulting his watch , he replied that it was three in the morning . this famous timepiece , always regulated on the greenwich meridian , which was now some seventy - seven degrees westward , was at least four hours slow . sir francis corrected passepartout 's time , whereupon the latter made the same remark that he had done to fix ; and upon the general insisting that the watch should be regulated in each new meridian , since he was constantly going eastward , that is in the face of the sun , and therefore the days were shorter by four minutes for each degree gone over , passepartout obstinately refused to alter his watch , which he kept at london time . it was an innocent delusion which could harm no one .",88
