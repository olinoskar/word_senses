"many traces we found of him in the bog - girt island where he had hid his savage ally . a huge driving - wheel and a shaft half - filled with rubbish showed the position of an abandoned mine . beside it were the crumbling remains of the cottages of the miners , driven away no doubt by the foul reek of the surrounding swamp . in one of these a staple and chain with a quantity of gnawed bones showed where the animal had been confined . a skeleton with a tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the debris .",64

"after leaving this gulf we raised muscat for an instant , the most important town in the country of oman . i marveled at its strange appearance in the midst of the black rocks surrounding it , against which the white of its houses and forts stood out sharply . i spotted the rounded domes of its mosques , the elegant tips of its minarets , and its fresh , leafy terraces . but it was only a fleeting vision , and the nautilus soon sank beneath the dark waves of these waterways .",34

"the streets at last became quiet , and the patrol , the officers of which , in their splendid costumes , and surrounded by their suites , passepartout thought seemed like ambassadors , succeeded the bustling crowd . each time a company passed , passepartout chuckled , and said to himself : "" good ! another japanese embassy departing for europe !

"the nautilus passed over these lush , luxuriant depths with tremendous speed . near evening it approached the falkland islands , whose rugged summits i recognized the next day . the sea was of moderate depth . so not without good reason , i assumed that these two islands , plus the many islets surrounding them , used to be part of the magellan coastline . the falkland islands were probably discovered by the famous navigator john davis , who gave them the name davis southern islands . later sir richard hawkins called them the maidenland , after the blessed virgin . subsequently , at the beginning of the 18th century , they were named the malouines by fishermen from saint - malo in brittany , then finally dubbed the falklands by the english , to whom they belong today .",54

"while i was in view of the moor that was swimming , i stood out directly to sea with the boat , rather stretching to windward , that they might think me gone towards the straits â€™ mouth ( as indeed any one that had been in their wits must have been supposed to do ) : for who would have supposed we were sailed on to the southward , to the truly barbarian coast , where whole nations of negroes were sure to surround us with their canoes and destroy us ; where we could not go on shore but we should be devoured by savage beasts , or more merciless savages of human kind .",84
"the garden was a wide inclosure , surrounded with walls so high as to exclude every glimpse of prospect ; a covered verandah ran down one side , and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little beds : these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate , and each bed had an owner .",7
"conseil was in dead earnest , but i did n't subscribe to his views . however , the situation had changed in only a short time and we had n't noticed . now some twenty dugout canoes were surrounding the nautilus . hollowed from tree trunks , these dugouts were long , narrow , and well designed for speed , keeping their balance by means of two bamboo poles that floated on the surface of the water . they were maneuvered by skillful , half - naked paddlers , and i viewed their advance with definite alarm .",38

"if the engineer had had only to deal with wild beasts , jaguars or others , he would have simply lighted fires all around his camp , which would have sufficed for its defense ; but the convicts would be rather attracted than terrified by the flames , and it was , therefore , better to be surrounded by the profound darkness of night .",57

"madrepores , which one must guard against confusing with precious coral , clothe their tissue in a limestone crust , and their variations in structure have led my famous mentor professor milne - edwards to classify them into five divisions . the tiny microscopic animals that secrete this polypary live by the billions in the depths of their cells . their limestone deposits build up into rocks , reefs , islets , islands . in some places , they form atolls , a circular ring surrounding a lagoon or small inner lake that gaps place in contact with the sea . elsewhere , they take the shape of barrier reefs , such as those that exist along the coasts of new caledonia and several of the tuamotu islands . in still other localities , such as rÃ©union island and the island of mauritius , they build fringing reefs , high , straight walls next to which the ocean 's depth is considerable .",85
