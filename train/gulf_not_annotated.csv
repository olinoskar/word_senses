"and then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had been infused into it concerning heaven and hell ; and for the first time it recoiled , baffled ; and for the first time glancing behind , on each side , and before it , it saw all round an unfathomed gulf : it felt the one point where it stood -- the present ; all the rest was formless cloud and vacant depth ; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering , and plunging amid that chaos .",54
"the wall of dakkar grotto had evidently given way under the pressure of gases , and the sea , rushing through the central shalt into the igneous gulf , was at once converted into vapor .",27
"it was an insane idea . fortunately i controlled myself and stretched out on the bed to soothe my bodily agitation . my nerves calmed a little , but with my brain so aroused , i did a swift review of my whole existence aboard the nautilus , every pleasant or unpleasant incident that had crossed my path since i went overboard from the abraham lincoln : the underwater hunting trip , the torres strait , our running aground , the savages of papua , the coral cemetery , the suez passageway , the island of santorini , the cretan diver , the bay of vigo , atlantis , the ice bank , the south pole , our imprisonment in the ice , the battle with the devilfish , the storm in the gulf stream , the avenger , and that horrible scene of the vessel sinking with its crew . . . ! all these events passed before my eyes like backdrops unrolling upstage in a theater . in this strange setting captain nemo then grew fantastically . his features were accentuated , taking on superhuman proportions . he was no longer my equal , he was the man of the waters , the spirit of the seas .",133
"at last i became more calm . i made a wise resolve to walk twice round the room quietly and settle my nerves , and then i returned into the deep gulf of the huge armchair .",31
"the next day , january 30 , when the nautilus rose to the surface of the ocean , there was no more land in sight . setting its course to the north - northwest , the ship headed toward the gulf of oman , carved out between arabia and the indian peninsula and providing access to the persian gulf .",40
"for four days until february 3 , the nautilus inspected the gulf of oman at various speeds and depths . it seemed to be traveling at random , as if hesitating over which course to follow , but it never crossed the tropic of cancer .",11
"after leaving this gulf we raised muscat for an instant , the most important town in the country of oman . i marveled at its strange appearance in the midst of the black rocks surrounding it , against which the white of its houses and forts stood out sharply . i spotted the rounded domes of its mosques , the elegant tips of its minarets , and its fresh , leafy terraces . but it was only a fleeting vision , and the nautilus soon sank beneath the dark waves of these waterways .",3
""" thoroughly abominable , professor aronnax . the greek and latin historians can find nothing to say in its favor , and the greek geographer strabo adds that it 's especially rough during the rainy season and the period of summer prevailing winds . the arab idrisi , referring to it by the name gulf of colzoum , relates that ships perished in large numbers on its sandbanks and that no one risked navigating it by night . this , he claims , is a sea subject to fearful hurricanes , strewn with inhospitable islands , and ' with nothing good to offer , ' either on its surface or in its depths . as a matter of fact , the same views can also be found in arrian , agatharchides , and artemidorus . """,54
"but , if he thought of these possibilities , he did not betray the fact by any outward sign . always the same impassible member of the reform club , whom no incident could surprise , as unvarying as the ship 's chronometers , and seldom having the curiosity even to go upon the deck , he passed through the memorable scenes of the red sea with cold indifference ; did not care to recognise the historic towns and villages which , along its borders , raised their picturesque outlines against the sky ; and betrayed no fear of the dangers of the arabic gulf , which the old historians always spoke of with horror , and upon which the ancient navigators never ventured without propitiating the gods by ample sacrifices . how did this eccentric personage pass his time on the mongolia ? he made his four hearty meals every day , regardless of the most persistent rolling and pitching on the part of the steamer ; and he played whist indefatigably , for he had found partners as enthusiastic in the game as himself .",104
"the result is that the gulf is completely sheltered on all sides , and i believe that even in the stormiest weather , the sea here must be as calm as a lake . """,5
"as i had once done thus in my breaking away from my parents , so i could not be content now , but i must go and leave the happy view i had of being a rich and thriving man in my new plantation , only to pursue a rash and immoderate desire of rising faster than the nature of the thing admitted ; and thus i cast myself down again into the deepest gulf of human misery that ever man fell into , or perhaps could be consistent with life and a state of health in the world .",74
"there were no longer high cliffs as at prospect heights , but a strange and capricious border which surrounded the narrow gulf between the two capes , formed of mineral matter , thrown up by the volcano .",21
"just then the gulf stream 's speed was 2.25 meters per second . so distinct is its current from the surrounding sea , its confined waters stand out against the ocean and operate on a different level from the colder waters . murky as well , and very rich in saline material , their pure indigo contrasts with the green waves surrounding them . moreover , their line of demarcation is so clear that abreast of the carolinas , the nautilus 's spur cut the waves of the gulf stream while its propeller was still churning those belonging to the ocean .",88
""" i keep coming back to my idea . we 've got to talk to the captain . when we were in your own country 's seas , you did n't say a word . now that we 're in mine , i intend to speak up . before a few days are out , i figure the nautilus will lie abreast of nova scotia , and from there to newfoundland is the mouth of a large gulf , and the st . lawrence empties into that gulf , and the st . lawrence is my own river , the river running by quebec , my hometown-- and when i think about all this , my gorge rises and my hair stands on end ! honestly , sir , i 'd rather jump overboard ! i ca n't stay here any longer ! i 'm suffocating !

""" now , "" said herbert , pointing to the other extremity of the island , "" let us call this gulf which is so singularly like a pair of open jaws , shark gulf . """,34
"dinner was ready . professor liedenbrock devoured his portion voraciously , for his compulsory fast on board had converted his stomach into a vast unfathomable gulf . there was nothing remarkable in the meal itself ; but the hospitality of our host , more danish than icelandic , reminded me of the heroes of old . it was evident that we were more at home than he was himself .",25
"oh , that gulf stream ! it truly lives up to its nickname , the lord of storms ! all by itself it creates these fearsome cyclones through the difference in temperature between its currents and the superimposed layers of air .",3
"there the wire , bending at a right angle , entered the yawning gulf .",13
