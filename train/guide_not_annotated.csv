it was eight o'clock in the morning . we had four hours to ourselves before the sun could be productively observed . i guided our steps toward a huge bay that made a crescent - shaped incision in the granite cliffs along the beach .,23
"i will see the queen ; i will relate to her the details of the disappearance of this poor woman , of which she is no doubt ignorant . these details will guide her on her part , and on your return , i shall perhaps have some good news to tell you .",32
"i will add that it was he who guided that chest , provided with everything we wanted , and stranded it on flotsam point ; that it was he who lighted that fire on the heights of the island , which permitted you to land ; that it was he who fired that bullet found in the body of the peccary ; that it was he who plunged that torpedo into the channel , which destroyed the brig ; in a word , that all those inexplicable events , for which we could not assign a reason , are due to this mysterious being .",8
"the rest of the day was passed in calculations and in conversations . i remained a steadfast adherent of the opinions of professor liedenbrock , and i envied the stolid indifference of hans , who , without going into causes and effects , went on with his eyes shut wherever his destiny guided him .",52
"the pilot went on board at six , and took his place on the bridge , to guide the rangoon through the channels to the port of hong kong . passepartout longed to ask him if the steamer had left for yokohama ; but he dared not , for he wished to preserve the spark of hope , which still remained till the last moment . he had confided his anxiety to fix who -- the sly rascal!--tried to console him by saying that mr . fogg would be in time if he took the next boat ; but this only put passepartout in a passion .",17
"the reporter got up , and guided by the boy went towards the cave .",6
"on the 23rd , several officers circled the island and brought back some rubble of little importance . the natives , adopting a system of denial and evasion , refused to guide them to the site of the casualty . this rather shady conduct aroused the suspicion that the natives had mistreated the castaways ; and in truth , the natives seemed afraid that dumont d'urville had come to avenge the count de la pérouse and his unfortunate companions .",31
"how i then blessed my uncle 's foresight in preventing the hunter from stopping up the hole in the granite . this beneficent spring , after having satisfied our thirst on the road , would now be my guide among the windings of the terrestrial crust .",38
"the pilot probably does not know to this day why his responses won him this enthusiastic greeting . he remounted the bridge , and guided the steamer through the flotilla of junks , tankas , and fishing boats which crowd the harbour of hong kong .",24
"begone , and may god guide you ! """,5
"there mr . fogg examined a curious vehicle , a kind of frame on two long beams , a little raised in front like the runners of a sledge , and upon which there was room for five or six persons . a high mast was fixed on the frame , held firmly by metallic lashings , to which was attached a large brigantine sail . this mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist a jib - sail . behind , a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle . it was , in short , a sledge rigged like a sloop . during the winter , when the trains are blocked up by the snow , these sledges make extremely rapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another . provided with more sails than a cutter , and with the wind behind them , they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not superior to that of the express trains .",89
"the skiff was put at our disposal for the next morning . i hardly needed to ask whether captain nemo would be coming along . i likewise assumed that no crewmen would be assigned to us , that ned land would be in sole charge of piloting the longboat . besides , the shore lay no more than two miles off , and it would be child 's play for the canadian to guide that nimble skiff through those rows of reefs so ill - fated for big ships .",73
"mr . fogg was quite ready . under his arm might have been observed a red - bound copy of bradshaw 's continental railway steam transit and general guide , with its timetables showing the arrival and departure of steamers and railways . he took the carpet - bag , opened it , and slipped into it a goodly roll of bank of england notes , which would pass wherever he might go .",28
"meanwhile the reddish light guiding us had expanded and inflamed the horizon . the presence of this furnace under the waters had me extremely puzzled . was it some sort of electrical discharge ? was i approaching some natural phenomenon still unknown to scientists on shore ? or , rather ( and this thought did cross my mind ) , had the hand of man intervened in that blaze ? had human beings fanned those flames ? in these deep strata would i meet up with more of captain nemo 's companions , friends he was about to visit who led lives as strange as his own ? would i find a whole colony of exiles down here , men tired of the world 's woes , men who had sought and found independence in the ocean 's lower depths ? all these insane , inadmissible ideas dogged me , and in this frame of mind , continually excited by the series of wonders passing before my eyes , i would n't have been surprised to find on this sea bottom one of those underwater towns captain nemo dreamed about !",4
"it then became necessary to leave the smoking mass to cool , and during this time neb and pencroft , guided by cyrus harding , brought , on a hurdle made of interlaced branches , loads of carbonate of lime and common stones , which were very abundant , to the north of the lake .",20
"yet , notwithstanding the difficulties of the descent , down steeps unknown to the guide , the journey was accomplished without accidents , except the loss of a coil of rope , which escaped from the hands of an icelander , and took the shortest way to the bottom of the abyss .",14
"do you not see it , jane ? consider a moment -- your strong sense will guide you . """,16
"at nine o’clock , guided by planchet , the little cavalcade set out , taking the route the carriage had taken .",4
""" what matters , "" replied the philosopher , "" whether this or another serves to guide us ? """,16
"yes : our compass was no longer a guide ; the needle flew from pole to pole with a kind of frenzied impulse ; it ran round the dial , and spun hither and thither as if it were giddy or intoxicated .",8
""" yes , "" replied herbert , "" and this time we shall have no obliging engineer to light a fire to guide us into port ! """,22
"entering the gate and passing the shrubs , the silhouette of a house rose to view , black , low , and rather long ; but the guiding light shone nowhere . all was obscurity .",27
""" if i am not mistaken , "" said he , approaching this person , with his most amiable smile , "" you are the gentleman who so kindly volunteered to guide me at suez ? """,31
"besides there would have been interminable hesitation before this choice of roads ; for since there was no indication whatever to guide our choice , we were obliged to trust to chance .",21
"by next evening , thanks to the industry and skill of our guide , the raft was made . it was ten feet by five ; the planks of surturbrand , braced strongly together with cords , presented an even surface , and when launched this improvised vessel floated easily upon the waves of the liedenbrock sea .",12
"as to going home , shame opposed the best motions that offered to my thoughts , and it immediately occurred to me how i should be laughed at among the neighbours , and should be ashamed to see , not my father and mother only , but even everybody else ; from whence i have since often observed , how incongruous and irrational the common temper of mankind is , especially of youth , to that reason which ought to guide them in such cases — viz . that they are not ashamed to sin , and yet are ashamed to repent ; not ashamed of the action for which they ought justly to be esteemed fools , but are ashamed of the returning , which only can make them be esteemed wise men .",80
""" no , your boy had been observed , and that gave me a guide where to look . """,14
"i try causes enough myself . i had once some liking for his philosophical works ; but when i found he doubted everything , i thought i knew as much as himself , and had no need of a guide to learn ignorance . """,39
"how was it that his instinct had guided him straight to the chimneys , which he did not know ?",7
"the two castaways , john ferrier and the little girl who had shared his fortunes and had been adopted as his daughter , accompanied the mormons to the end of their great pilgrimage . little lucy ferrier was borne along pleasantly enough in elder stangerson 's waggon , a retreat which she shared with the mormon 's three wives and with his son , a headstrong forward boy of twelve . having rallied , with the elasticity of childhood , from the shock caused by her mother 's death , she soon became a pet with the women , and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving canvas - covered home . in the meantime ferrier having recovered from his privations , distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable hunter . so rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions , that when they reached the end of their wanderings , it was unanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers , with the exception of young himself , and of stangerson , kemball , johnston , and drebber , who were the four principal elders .",129
"it only remained now to find a guide , which was comparatively easy . a young parsee , with an intelligent face , offered his services , which mr . fogg accepted , promising so generous a reward as to materially stimulate his zeal .",7
""" i am afraid , my dear watson , that most of your conclusions were erroneous . when i said that you stimulated me i meant , to be frank , that in noting your fallacies i was occasionally guided towards the truth . not that you are entirely wrong in this instance . the man is certainly a country practitioner . and he walks a good deal . """,39
""" you know this place , mason , "" said our guide ; "" she bit and stabbed you here . """,11
"the dog then left the beach , and guided by his wonderful instinct , without showing the least hesitation , went straight in among the downs .",8
"how i wished at this moment i could have made him understand me . my words , my complaints , my sorrow would have had some influence over that frigid nature . those dangers which our guide could not understand i could have demonstrated and proved to him . together we might have over - ruled the obstinate professor ; if it were needed , we might perhaps have compelled him to regain the heights of snæfell .",36
"guided by his skillful hands , the nautilus passed by all these different masses of ice , which are classified by size and shape with a precision that enraptured conseil : "" icebergs , "" or mountains ; "" ice fields , "" or smooth , limitless tracts ; "" drift ice , "" or floating floes ; "" packs , "" or broken tracts , called "" patches "" when they 're circular and "" streams "" when they form long strips .",0
"he ordered two horses to be saddled , and himself went as guide to the young guardsman .",12
"we have heard how , guided by an instinct which might be looked upon almost as supernatural , top had found them .",5
"often , no longer seeing any way out , i thought we were imprisoned for good , but captain nemo , guided by his instincts , discovered new passageways from the tiniest indications . he was never wrong when he observed slender threads of bluish water streaking through these ice fields . accordingly , i was sure that he had already risked his nautilus in the midst of the antarctic seas .",21
""" yes , in a passive way : i make no effort ; i follow as inclination guides me . there is no merit in such goodness . """,17
"the train was about to start from allahabad , and mr . fogg proceeded to pay the guide the price agreed upon for his service , and not a farthing more ; which astonished passepartout , who remembered all that his master owed to the guide 's devotion . he had , indeed , risked his life in the adventure at pillaji , and , if he should be caught afterwards by the indians , he would with difficulty escape their vengeance . kiouni , also , must be disposed of . what should be done with the elephant , which had been so dearly purchased ? phileas fogg had already determined this question .",17
""" take him , guide , "" returned mr . fogg , "" and i shall still be your debtor . """,4
"the wire , sometimes stretched over the lower branches of the trees , sometimes lying on the ground , guided them surely .",19
""" well , let us allow the water to run on . it will flow down , and will both guide and refresh us . """,20
""" that is well planned , "" i cried . "" with this stream for our guide , there is no reason why we should not succeed in our undertaking . """,16
"the gallery dipped down a very little way from the horizontal , scarcely more than two inches in a fathom , and the stream ran gently murmuring at our feet . i compared it to a friendly genius guiding us underground , and caressed with my hand the soft naiad , whose comforting voice accompanied our steps . with my reviving spirits these mythological notions seemed to come unbidden .",38
""" no , no . i remember the thrill in your voice . i remember the look in your eyes . please , please , be frank with me , miss stapleton , for ever since i have been here i have been conscious of shadows all round me . life has become like that great grimpen mire , with little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track . tell me then what it was that you meant , and i will promise to convey your warning to sir henry . """,72
"half an hour later , guided by its electric trail , we reached the nautilus . the outside door had been left open , and captain nemo closed it after we reentered the first cell . then he pressed a button . i heard pumps operating within the ship , i felt the water lowering around me , and in a few moments the cell was completely empty . the inside door opened , and we passed into the wardrobe .",5
"we were a little uneasy , however , when we found it snowed one whole day and a night so fast that we could not travel ; but he bid us be easy ; we should soon be past it all : we found , indeed , that we began to descend every day , and to come more north than before ; and so , depending upon our guide , we went on .",69
"it was about two hours before night when , our guide being something before us , and not just in sight , out rushed three monstrous wolves , and after them a bear , from a hollow way adjoining to a thick wood ; two of the wolves made at the guide , and had he been far before us , he would have been devoured before we could have helped him ; one of them fastened upon his horse , and the other attacked the man with such violence , that he had not time , or presence of mind enough , to draw his pistol , but hallooed and cried out to us most lustily . my man friday being next me , i bade him ride up and see what was the matter . as soon as friday came in sight of the man , he hallooed out as loud as the other , “ o master ! o master ! ” but like a bold fellow , rode directly up to the poor man , and with his pistol shot the wolf in the head that attacked him .",51
"my principal guide and privy - counsellor was my good ancient widow , who , in gratitude for the money i had sent her , thought no pains too much nor care too great to employ for me ; and i trusted her so entirely that i was perfectly easy as to the security of my effects ; and , indeed , i was very happy from the beginning , and now to the end , in the unspotted integrity of this good gentlewoman .",2
"while he and herbert , guided by neb , went to the place where the footprints were to be found , cyrus remarked to the reporter,--",5
finally the ship 's rays appeared . their luminous trail guided us to the nautilus . by one o'clock we had returned .,10
"i must have walked like a somnambulist , without any knowledge of my steps , and top must have guided me here , after having dragged me from the waves ...",19
"meanwhile top had returned at his master 's call , and had regained the shore : but he could not stay quiet ; he plunged in among the tall grass , and guided by instinct , he appeared to follow some invisible being which was slipping along under the surface of the water .",32
"there the ocean floor formed a valley 120 kilometers wide , into which you could fit mt . blanc without its summit poking above the surface of the waves . this valley is closed off to the east by a sheer wall 2,000 meters high . we arrived there on may 28 , and the nautilus lay no farther than 150 kilometers from ireland . would captain nemo head up north and beach us on the british isles ? no . much to my surprise , he went back down south and returned to european seas . as we swung around the emerald isle , i spotted cape clear for an instant , plus the lighthouse on fastnet rock that guides all those thousands of ships setting out from glasgow or liverpool .",120
"it will suffice , then , to tell them that at the moment at which , discouraged by so many fruitless investigations , we were about to abandon our search , we at length found , guided by the counsels of our illustrious friend paulin paris , a manuscript in folio , endorsed 4772 or 4773 , we do not recollect which , having for title , "" memoirs of the comte de la fere , touching some events which passed in france toward the end of the reign of king louis xiii and the commencement of the reign of king louis xiv . """,36
""" well thought out , mr . land , "" i replied . "" but as yet , i do n't believe we 've been tendered any enlistment offers . consequently , it 's pointless to argue about what tactics we should pursue in such a case . i repeat : let 's wait , let 's be guided by events , and let 's do nothing , since right now there 's nothing we can do . """,58
"nevertheless , i 'm well aware that the nautilus is drawing near to populated shores , and if some chance for salvation becomes available to us , it would be sheer cruelty to sacrifice my companions to my passion for the unknown . i must go with them , perhaps even guide them . but will this opportunity ever arise ? the human being , robbed of his free will , craves such an opportunity ; but the scientist , forever inquisitive , dreads it .",51
