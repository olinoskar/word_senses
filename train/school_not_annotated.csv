"i would have been deeply interested in visiting this long , 360-league reef , against which the ever - surging sea broke with the fearsome intensity of thunderclaps . but just then the nautilus 's slanting fins took us to great depths , and i could see nothing of those high coral walls . i had to rest content with the various specimens of fish brought up by our nets . among others i noted some long - finned albacore , a species in the genus scomber , as big as tuna , bluish on the flanks , and streaked with crosswise stripes that disappear when the animal dies . these fish followed us in schools and supplied our table with very dainty flesh . we also caught a large number of yellow - green gilthead , half a decimeter long and tasting like dorado , plus some flying gurnards , authentic underwater swallows that , on dark nights , alternately streak air and water with their phosphorescent glimmers . among mollusks and zoophytes , i found in our trawl 's meshes various species of alcyonarian coral , sea urchins , hammer shells , spurred - star shells , wentletrap snails , horn shells , glass snails . the local flora was represented by fine floating algae : sea tangle , and kelp from the genus macrocystis , saturated with the mucilage their pores perspire , from which i selected a wonderful nemastoma geliniaroidea , classifying it with the natural curiosities in the museum .",115

"like a covey of snipe over a marsh , there rose underfoot schools of unusual fish from the genus monopterus , whose members have no fin but their tail . i recognized the javanese eel , a genuine eight - decimeter serpent with a bluish gray belly , which , without the gold lines over its flanks , could easily be confused with the conger eel . from the butterfish genus , whose oval bodies are very flat , i observed several adorned in brilliant colors and sporting a dorsal fin like a sickle , edible fish that , when dried and marinated , make an excellent dish known by the name "" karawade "" ; then some sea poachers , fish belonging to the genus aspidophoroides , whose bodies are covered with scaly armor divided into eight lengthwise sections .",12

"can i think you have any esteem for a writer who has spoiled tasso 's hell and the devil ; who transforms lucifer sometimes into a toad , and at others into a pygmy ; who makes him say the same thing over again a hundred times ; who metamorphoses him into a school - divine ; and who , by an absurdly serious imitation of ariosto 's comic invention of firearms , represents the devils and angels cannonading each other in heaven ?",53
"the canadian was not mistaken . cavorting around the nautilus was a school of triggerfish with flat bodies , grainy skins , armed with stings on their dorsal fins , and with four prickly rows of quills quivering on both sides of their tails . nothing could have been more wonderful than the skin covering them : white underneath , gray above , with spots of gold sparkling in the dark eddies of the waves . around them , rays were undulating like sheets flapping in the wind , and among these i spotted , much to my glee , a chinese ray , yellowish on its topside , a dainty pink on its belly , and armed with three stings behind its eyes ; a rare species whose very existence was still doubted in lacépède 's day , since that pioneering classifier of fish had seen one only in a portfolio of japanese drawings .",12

"this current swept along with it a whole host of moving creatures . argonauts , so common in the mediterranean , voyaged here in schools of large numbers . among cartilaginous fish , the most remarkable were rays whose ultra slender tails made up nearly a third of the body , which was shaped like a huge diamond twenty - five feet long ; then little one - meter sharks , the head large , the snout short and rounded , the teeth sharp and arranged in several rows , the body seemingly covered with scales .",24
"but as the bushes shrank , the tree forms magnified . actual petrified thickets and long alcoves from some fantastic school of architecture kept opening up before our steps . captain nemo entered beneath a dark gallery whose gentle slope took us to a depth of 100 meters . the light from our glass coils produced magical effects at times , lingering on the wrinkled roughness of some natural arch , or some overhang suspended like a chandelier , which our lamps flecked with fiery sparks . amid these shrubs of precious coral , i observed other polyps no less unusual : melita coral , rainbow coral with jointed outgrowths , then a few tufts of genus corallina , some green and others red , actually a type of seaweed encrusted with limestone salts , which , after long disputes , naturalists have finally placed in the vegetable kingdom . but as one intellectual has remarked , "" here , perhaps , is the actual point where life rises humbly out of slumbering stone , but without breaking away from its crude starting point .

"after leaving these delightful islands to the protection of the french flag , the nautilus covered about 2,000 miles from december 4 to the 11th . its navigating was marked by an encounter with an immense school of squid , unusual mollusks that are near neighbors of the cuttlefish . french fishermen give them the name "" cuckoldfish , "" and they belong to the class cephalopoda , family dibranchiata , consisting of themselves together with cuttlefish and argonauts . the naturalists of antiquity made a special study of them , and these animals furnished many ribald figures of speech for soapbox orators in the greek marketplace , as well as excellent dishes for the tables of rich citizens , if we 're to believe athenaeus , a greek physician predating galen .",36
"it was during the night of december 9 - 10 that the nautilus encountered this army of distinctly nocturnal mollusks . they numbered in the millions . they were migrating from the temperate zones toward zones still warmer , following the itineraries of herring and sardines . we stared at them through our thick glass windows : they swam backward with tremendous speed , moving by means of their locomotive tubes , chasing fish and mollusks , eating the little ones , eaten by the big ones , and tossing in indescribable confusion the ten feet that nature has rooted in their heads like a hairpiece of pneumatic snakes . despite its speed , the nautilus navigated for several hours in the midst of this school of animals , and its nets brought up an incalculable number , among which i recognized all nine species that professor orbigny has classified as native to the pacific ocean .",125

"for about an hour the nautilus cruised in the midst of this school of mollusks . then , lord knows why , they were gripped with a sudden fear . as if at a signal , every sail was abruptly lowered ; arms folded , bodies contracted , shells turned over by changing their center of gravity , and the whole flotilla disappeared under the waves . it was instantaneous , and no squadron of ships ever maneuvered with greater togetherness .",12
