"at dawn , some of the lighter clouds had risen into the more lofty regions of the air .",14
"towards eleven o'clock , the lower region of the air was sensibly clearer .",6
"it was , however , evident to the voyagers that the gas was failing , and that the balloon could no longer be sustained in the higher regions .",27
"we had long lost sight of the sea shore behind the hills of bones . the rash professor , careless of losing his way , hurried me forward . we advanced in silence , bathed in luminous electric fluid . by some phenomenon which i am unable to explain , it lighted up all sides of every object equally . such was its diffusiveness , there being no central point from which the light emanated , that shadows no longer existed . you might have thought yourself under the rays of a vertical sun in a tropical region at noonday and the height of summer . no vapour was visible . the rocks , the distant mountains , a few isolated clumps of forest trees in the distance , presented a weird and wonderful aspect under these totally new conditions of a universal diffusion of light . we were like hoffmann 's shadowless man .",97
"in every big city the monster was the latest rage ; they sang about it in the coffee houses , they ridiculed it in the newspapers , they dramatized it in the theaters . the tabloids found it a fine opportunity for hatching all sorts of hoaxes . in those newspapers short of copy , you saw the reappearance of every gigantic imaginary creature , from "" moby dick , "" that dreadful white whale from the high arctic regions , to the stupendous kraken whose tentacles could entwine a 500-ton craft and drag it into the ocean depths . they even reprinted reports from ancient times : the views of aristotle and pliny accepting the existence of such monsters , then the norwegian stories of bishop pontoppidan , the narratives of paul egede , and finally the reports of captain harrington-- whose good faith is above suspicion -- in which he claims he saw , while aboard the castilian in 1857 , one of those enormous serpents that , until then , had frequented only the seas of france 's old extremist newspaper , the constitutionalist .",79
"in fact , at a distance of a quarter of a mile , leaning against the trunk of a gigantic kauri , stood a human being , the proteus of those subterranean regions , a new son of neptune , watching this countless herd of mastodons .",32
the laplanders and the samoides will find the climate of the polar regions on the shores of the mediterranean .,12
"the next day , march 22 , at six o'clock in the morning , preparations for departure began . the last gleams of twilight were melting into night . the cold was brisk . the constellations were glittering with startling intensity . the wonderful southern cross , polar star of the antarctic regions , twinkled at its zenith .",52
""" the deepest parts of the ocean are totally unknown to us . no soundings have been able to reach them . what goes on in those distant depths ? what creatures inhabit , or could inhabit , those regions twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the water ? what is the constitution of these animals ? it 's almost beyond conjecture .",39
""" we are coming now rather into the region of guesswork , "" said dr . mortimer .",8
"from that day forward , who knows where the nautilus took us in the north atlantic basin ? always at incalculable speed ! always amid the high arctic mists ! did it call at the capes of spitzbergen or the shores of novaya zemlya ? did it visit such uncharted seas as the white sea , the kara sea , the gulf of ob , the lyakhov islands , or those unknown beaches on the siberian coast ? i 'm unable to say . i lost track of the passing hours . time was in abeyance on the ship 's clocks . as happens in the polar regions , it seemed that night and day no longer followed their normal sequence . i felt myself being drawn into that strange domain where the overwrought imagination of edgar allan poe was at home . like his fabled arthur gordon pym , i expected any moment to see that "" shrouded human figure , very far larger in its proportions than any dweller among men , "" thrown across the cataract that protects the outskirts of the pole !",107
"again i questioned , but this time only in thought . "" where is that region ? does it exist ? """,15
"on the other side of the blown - up rock was an abyss . the explosion had caused a kind of earthquake in this fissured and abysmal region ; a great gulf had opened ; and the sea , now changed into a torrent , was hurrying us along into it .",27
"however , it was not long before they submitted to this new service , for the onager , being less refractory than the zebra , is frequently put in harness in the mountainous regions of southern africa , and it has even been acclimatized in europe , under zones of a relative coolness .",33
"at six o'clock the day broke suddenly , with that speed unique to tropical regions , which experience no real dawn or dusk . the sun 's rays pierced the cloud curtain gathered on the easterly horizon , and the radiant orb rose swiftly .",14
"what a sight ! how can i describe it ! how can i portray these woods and rocks in this liquid setting , their lower parts dark and sullen , their upper parts tinted red in this light whose intensity was doubled by the reflecting power of the waters ! we scaled rocks that crumbled behind us , collapsing in enormous sections with the hollow rumble of an avalanche . to our right and left there were carved gloomy galleries where the eye lost its way . huge glades opened up , seemingly cleared by the hand of man , and i sometimes wondered whether some residents of these underwater regions would suddenly appear before me .",110
this region required a long and careful exploration .,1
"little by little ned developed a taste for chatting , and i loved hearing the tales of his adventures in the polar seas . he described his fishing trips and his battles with great natural lyricism . his tales took on the form of an epic poem , and i felt i was hearing some canadian homer reciting his iliad of the high arctic regions .",64
"however , the weather held good . our voyage was proceeding under the most favorable conditions . by then it was the bad season in these southernmost regions , because july in this zone corresponds to our january in europe ; but the sea remained smooth and easily visible over a vast perimeter .",27
"yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable . a cadaverousness of complexion ; an eye large , liquid , and luminous beyond comparison ; lips somewhat thin and very pallid , but of a surpassingly beautiful curve ; a nose of a delicate hebrew model , but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations ; a finely moulded chin , speaking , in its want of prominence , of a want of moral energy ; hair of a more than web - like softness and tenuity;—these features , with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple , made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten .",101
"accustomed to go far into the regions of scientific reality , he would not allow himself to be drawn into the regions of the strange and almost of the supernatural ; but yet how to explain why top , one of those sensible dogs who never waste their time in barking at the moon , should persist in trying with scent and hearing to fathom this abyss , if there was nothing there to cause his uneasiness ?",6

""" then let 's keep hunting , "" conseil replied , "" but while heading back to the sea . we 've arrived at the foothills of these mountains , and i think we 'll do better if we return to the forest regions . """,43
"as to flint , that would not be wanting in these regions of plutonic origin .",11
""" that may be , "" i replied ; "" but if there have been creatures now extinct in these underground regions , why may not some of those monsters be now roaming through these gloomy forests , or hidden behind the steep crags ? """,21
"the castaways proceeded toward the north of the land on which chance had thrown them , an unknown region , the geographical situation of which they could not even guess .",18
""" well , i would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented road , "" i reflected . "" and far better that crows and ravens -- if any ravens there be in these regions -- should pick my flesh from my bones , than that they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper 's grave .

""" well , let us make some lines , and see if the bait will draw here as it does in sublunary regions . """,22
"after leaving the region of bushes , the party , assisted by resting on each other 's shoulders , climbed for about a hundred feet up a steep acclivity and reached a level place , with very few trees , where the soil appeared volcanic .",3
"they were not ordinary sheep , but a species usually found in the mountainous regions of the temperate zone , to which herbert gave the name of the musmon .",14
""" i mean that nothing could be easier than taking a photograph of this underwater region ! """,15
""" this is my decision , "" replied professor liedenbrock , putting on one of his grandest airs . "" neither you nor anybody else knows with any certainty what is going on in the interior of this globe , since not the twelve thousandth part of its radius is known ; science is eminently perfectible ; and every new theory is soon routed by a newer . was it not always believed until fourier that the temperature of the interplanetary spaces decreased perpetually ? and is it not known at the present time that the greatest cold of the ethereal regions is never lower than 40 degrees below zero fahr . ? why should it not be the same with the internal heat ? why should it not , at a certain depth , attain an impassable limit , instead of rising to such a point as to fuse the most infusible metals ? """,101
"during the night of march 13 - 14 , the nautilus resumed its southward heading . once it was abreast of cape horn , i thought it would strike west of the cape , make for pacific seas , and complete its tour of the world . it did nothing of the sort and kept moving toward the southernmost regions . so where was it bound ? the pole ? that was insanity . i was beginning to think that the captain 's recklessness more than justified ned land 's worst fears .",59
"looking down on this very scene , there stood upon the fourth of may , eighteen hundred and forty - seven , a solitary traveller . his appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region . an observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty . his face was lean and haggard , and the brown parchment - like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones ; his long , brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white ; his eyes were sunken in his head , and burned with an unnatural lustre ; while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton . as he stood , he leaned upon his weapon for support , and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution . his gaunt face , however , and his clothes , which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs , proclaimed what it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance . the man was dying — dying from hunger and from thirst .",42
"now it happens that it is during the winter of the southern countries that it is at its most distant point from the sun , and consequently , in a situation for those regions to feel the greatest cold .",33
"besides , from the shape of the crater -- the opening broken in the upper edge -- the matter would be thrown to the side opposite the fertile regions of the island .",28
"it was , therefore , decided that the expedition should be carried through the far west , so as to include all that region situated on the right of the mercy .",23
already widely disturbed regions on the surface of the water indicate some commotion below . the danger is approaching . we must be on the look out .,3
"it might even be inferred that such was the case , so rich did this region appear in the most magnificent specimens of the flora of the temperate zones .",15
"they had then to find fresh water , and it was not likely that it would be wanting in such a capriciously uneven region .",23
"while i paced softly on , the last sound i expected to hear in so still a region , a laugh , struck my ear . it was a curious laugh ; distinct , formal , mirthless .",17
"the conversation , thus turned on adele , continued till we reached the light and cheerful region below .",16
"passepartout was now the only person left in the car , and the elder , looking him full in the face , reminded him that , two years after the assassination of joseph smith , the inspired prophet , brigham young , his successor , left nauvoo for the banks of the great salt lake , where , in the midst of that fertile region , directly on the route of the emigrants who crossed utah on their way to california , the new colony , thanks to the polygamy practised by the mormons , had flourished beyond expectations .",64
"when winter comes , it restores this heat , which insures for the regions near the ocean a medium temperature , less high in summer , but less low in winter . """,13
"the next day , the 18th of february , was devoted to the exploration of all that wooded region forming the shore from reptile end to falls river .",18
"as we approach nearer the dimensions of the liquid column become magnificent . the islet resembles , with a most deceiving likeness , an enormous cetacean , whose head dominates the waves at a height of twenty yards . the geyser , a word meaning ' fury , ' rises majestically from its extremity . deep and heavy explosions are heard from time to time , when the enormous jet , possessed with more furious violence , shakes its plumy crest , and springs with a bound till it reaches the lowest stratum of the clouds . it stands alone . no steam vents , no hot springs surround it , and all the volcanic power of the region is concentrated here . sparks of electric fire mingle with the dazzling sheaf of lighted fluid , every drop of which refracts the prismatic colours .",118
"still i am constrained to confess that hitherto we have been wonderfully favoured , and that for some reason unknown to myself we have accomplished our journey under singularly favourable conditions of temperature . but it seems manifest to me that some day we shall reach a region where the central heat attains its highest limits , and goes beyond a point that can be registered by our thermometers .",47
"for ned land , as well as for every navigator before us , i knew that this was the great insurmountable obstacle . when the sun appeared for an instant near noon , captain nemo took a reasonably accurate sight that gave our position as longitude 51 degrees 30 ' and latitude 67 degrees 39 ' south . this was a position already well along in these antarctic regions .",68
"i told you we shall be married in four weeks . the wedding is to take place quietly , in the church down below yonder ; and then i shall waft you away at once to town . after a brief stay there , i shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun : to french vineyards and italian plains ; and she shall see whatever is famous in old story and in modern record : she shall taste , too , of the life of cities ; and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison with others . """,50
"so saying , he leaped lightly onto the sand . his heart must have been throbbing with intense excitement . he scaled an overhanging rock that ended in a small promontory and there , mute and motionless , with crossed arms and blazing eyes , he seemed to be laying claim to these southernmost regions . after spending five minutes in this trance , he turned to us .",54
"during the day of december 11 , i was busy reading in the main lounge . ned land and conseil were observing the luminous waters through the gaping panels . the nautilus was motionless . its ballast tanks full , it was sitting at a depth of 1,000 meters in a comparatively unpopulated region of the ocean where only larger fish put in occasional appearances .",53
they might have believed themselves to be on the desolate coast of some island in the antarctic regions which the ice had invaded .,17
"the strong blast and the soft breeze ; the rough and the halcyon day ; the hours of sunrise and sunset ; the moonlight and the clouded night , developed for me , in these regions , the same attraction as for them -- wound round my faculties the same spell that entranced theirs .",35
