"as i said , the nautilus veered to the east . to be more accurate , i should have said to the northeast . sometimes on the surface of the waves , sometimes beneath them , the ship wandered for days amid these mists so feared by navigators . these are caused chiefly by melting ice , which keeps the air extremely damp . how many ships have perished in these waterways as they tried to get directions from the hazy lights on the coast ! how many casualties have been caused by these opaque mists ! how many collisions have occurred with these reefs , where the breaking surf is covered by the noise of the wind ! how many vessels have rammed each other , despite their running lights , despite the warnings given by their bosun 's pipes and alarm bells !",81

"so i summoned conseil , who brought me a small , light dragnet similar to those used in oyster fishing .",11
"she was a big woman , and had long black hair : we could see it streaming against the flames as she stood . i witnessed , and several more witnessed , mr . rochester ascend through the sky - light on to the roof ; we heard him call ' bertha ! '",40
"she knew she had only two days left ; that when once the order was signed by buckingham -- and buckingham would sign it the more readily from its bearing a false name , and he could not , therefore , recognize the woman in question -- once this order was signed , we say , the baron would make her embark immediately , and she knew very well that women condemned to exile employ arms much less powerful in their seductions than the pretendedly virtuous woman whose beauty is lighted by the sun of the world , whose style the voice of fashion lauds , and whom a halo of aristocracy gilds with enchanting splendors .",90
"this light was my forlorn hope : i must gain it . having crossed the marsh , i saw a trace of white over the moor .",1
""" could n't we enlarge it , hollow it out , make openings to let in light and air ? "" replied pencroft , who now thought nothing impossible .",16
"from eight to nine o'clock , the nautilus stayed a few meters beneath the waters . according to my calculations , we had to be quite close to suez . through the panels in the lounge , i spotted rocky bottoms brightly lit by our electric rays . it seemed to me that the strait was getting narrower and narrower .",42

"then milady collected all her energies , murmuring in the depths of her soul the name of felton -- the only beam of light that penetrated to her in the hell into which she had fallen ; and like a serpent which folds and unfolds its rings to ascertain its strength , she enveloped felton beforehand in the thousand meshes of her inventive imagination .",23

"the cabin was dark ; but my eyes soon grew accustomed to its darkness and i saw the pilot , a muscular man whose hands rested on the pegs of the wheel . outside , the sea was brightly lit by the beacon shining behind the cabin at the other end of the platform .",39
"near the middle of the platform , the skiff was half set in the ship 's hull , making a slight bulge . fore and aft stood two cupolas of moderate height , their sides slanting and partly inset with heavy biconvex glass , one reserved for the helmsman steering the nautilus , the other for the brilliance of the powerful electric beacon lighting his way .",63
"along the narrow walls of this passageway , i saw only brilliant streaks , hard lines , fiery furrows , all scrawled by our speeding electric light . with my hand i tried to curb the pounding of my heart .",26

"from the extremity of the promontory which formed the tail of the peninsula the coast was rounded for a distance of five miles , which was rapidly passed over , without even the most minute investigations bringing to light the least trace of any old or recent landings ; no debris , no mark of an encampment , no cinders of a fire , nor even a footprint !",38
"i told her stories as long as she would listen to them ; and then for a change i took her out into the gallery . the hall lamp was now lit , and it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing backwards and forwards .",31

"to - night i was to be miss miller 's bed - fellow ; she helped me to undress : when laid down i glanced at the long rows of beds , each of which was quickly filled with two occupants ; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished , and amidst silence and complete darkness i fell asleep .",47
"harding took a lighted branch , and threw it into the abyss .",3
"the blazing resin , whose illuminating power increased still more by the rapidity of its fall , lighted up the interior of the well , but yet nothing appeared .",17
"it was very probable that ayrton would not be able to throw any light on the circumstances under which the bodies had been found , since he himself was not aware that he was in the corral .",13
"again the bell rang : all formed in file , two and two , and in that order descended the stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom : here prayers were read by miss miller ; afterwards she called out--",27
"the fire was lighted , and it was easy to preserve some embers .",3
"i proceeded : at last my way opened , the trees thinned a little ; presently i beheld a railing , then the house -- scarce , by this dim light , distinguishable from the trees ; so dank and green were its decaying walls .",30
"just then i was in the bow , leaning over the starboard rail . conseil , stationed beside me , stared straight ahead . roosting in the shrouds , the crew examined the horizon , which shrank and darkened little by little . officers were probing the increasing gloom with their night glasses . sometimes the murky ocean sparkled beneath moonbeams that darted between the fringes of two clouds . then all traces of light vanished into the darkness .",74
"ned land was just pronouncing these last words when we were suddenly plunged into darkness , utter darkness . the ceiling lights went out so quickly , my eyes literally ached , just as if we had experienced the opposite sensation of going from the deepest gloom to the brightest sunlight .",21
"nothing therefore which threw any light on the supposed wreck could be found on this shore , yet an object of any importance , such as the hull of a ship , would have been seen directly , or any of her masts and spars would have been washed on shore , just as the chest had been , which was found twenty miles from here .",5
"suddenly , through two oblong openings , daylight appeared on both sides of the lounge . the liquid masses came into view , brightly lit by the ship 's electric outpourings . we were separated from the sea by two panes of glass . initially i shuddered at the thought that these fragile partitions could break ; but strong copper bands secured them , giving them nearly infinite resistance .",24
"this quadruped was a sort of pig nearly two feet and a half long , of a blackish brown color , lighter below , having hard scanty hair ; its toes , then strongly fixed in the ground , seemed to be united by a membrane .",21
"by the light of the fire he cut two little flat rulers , which he joined together at one end so as to form a pair of compasses , whose legs could separate or come together .",2
the sailor then struck a light and set fire to a twig .,5

"it was therefore decided that neb and pencroft should go to port balloon , and that there , at nightfall , they should light an immense fire , the blaze of which would necessarily attract the attention of the brig .",23
"the dowager might be between forty and fifty : her shape was still fine ; her hair ( by candle - light at least ) still black ; her teeth , too , were still apparently perfect .",21
"the transparency of salt water has long been recognized . its clarity is believed to exceed that of spring water . the mineral and organic substances it holds in suspension actually increase its translucency . in certain parts of the caribbean sea , you can see the sandy bottom with startling distinctness as deep as 145 meters down , and the penetrating power of the sun 's rays seems to give out only at a depth of 300 meters . but in this fluid setting traveled by the nautilus , our electric glow was being generated in the very heart of the waves . it was no longer illuminated water , it was liquid light .",114
"two cable lengths off the abraham lincoln 's starboard quarter , the sea seemed to be lit up from underneath . this was no mere phosphorescent phenomenon , that much was unmistakable . submerged some fathoms below the surface of the water , the monster gave off that very intense but inexplicable glow that several captains had mentioned in their reports . this magnificent radiance had to come from some force with a great illuminating capacity . the edge of its light swept over the sea in an immense , highly elongated oval , condensing at the center into a blazing core whose unbearable glow diminished by degrees outward .",16

"day had returned . no ray of light penetrated into the profundity of the cavern . it being high - water , the entrance was closed by the sea . but the artificial light , which escaped in long streams from the skylights of the "" nautilus "" was as vivid as before , and the sheet of water shone around the floating vessel .",7

"the blizzard lasted until the next day . it was impossible to stay on the platform . from the lounge , where i was writing up the incidents of this excursion to the polar continent , i could hear the calls of petrel and albatross cavorting in the midst of the turmoil . the nautilus did n't stay idle , and cruising along the coast , it advanced some ten miles farther south amid the half light left by the sun as it skimmed the edge of the horizon .",76

"at six o'clock day began to break , and with the dawn 's early light , the narwhale 's electric glow disappeared . at seven o'clock the day was well along , but a very dense morning mist shrank the horizon , and our best spyglasses were unable to pierce it . the outcome : disappointment and anger .",14
"the vessel was two miles off . it drew nearer , always moving toward the phosphorescent glow that signaled the nautilus 's presence . i saw its green and red running lights , plus the white lantern hanging from the large stay of its foremast . hazy flickerings were reflected on its rigging and indicated that its furnaces were pushed to the limit . showers of sparks and cinders of flaming coal escaped from its funnels , spangling the air with stars .",31
"it was the engineer 's intention to divide the right portion of the cavern into several rooms , preceded by an entrance passage , and to light it by means of five windows and a door , pierced in the front .",26
"athos availed himself of the permission , ascended the stairs with his lightest step , gained the landing , and through the open door perceived milady putting on her hat .",12
"for part of the night , the novelty of our circumstances kept conseil and me at the lounge window . the sea was lit by our beacon 's electric rays . but the depths were deserted . fish did n't linger in these imprisoned waters . here they found merely a passageway for going from the antarctic ocean to open sea at the pole . our progress was swift . you could feel it in the vibrations of the long steel hull .",23
light whiskers bordering on red surrounded his face .,0
"my companions and i then witnessed an unusual sight . the panels in the lounge were open , and since the nautilus 's beacon was off , a hazy darkness reigned in the midst of the waters . covered with heavy clouds , the stormy sky gave only the faintest light to the ocean 's upper strata .",50
"the front of granite house was then to be lighted by five windows and a door , besides a large bay window and some smaller oval ones , which would admit plenty of light to enter into the marvelous nave which was to be their chief room .",33
"at eleven o'clock the electric lights came back on . i went into the lounge . it was deserted . i consulted the various instruments . the nautilus was fleeing northward at a speed of twenty - five miles per hour , sometimes on the surface of the sea , sometimes thirty feet beneath it .",5
"the light and active boy then sprang on the first branches , the arrangement of which made the ascent of the kauri easy , and in a few minutes he arrived at the summit , which emerged from the immense plain of verdure .",1
""" you will bring lights , and relieve the sentinel , "" continued felton .",4
"behind this eye was apparently a cabin containing the wheels of the rudder , and in which was stationed the helmsman , when he navigated the "" nautilus "" over the bed of the ocean , which the electric rays would evidently light up to a considerable distance .",42
"the face of this young woman was covered with a black velvet mask ; but notwithstanding this precaution , which was in fact taken rather against others than against him , he at once recognized his usual guide , the light and intelligent mme . bonacieux .",40

"if we accept the hypotheses of the microbiologist ehrenberg-- who believes that these underwater depths are lit up by phosphorescent organisms -- nature has certainly saved one of her most prodigious sights for residents of the sea , and i could judge for myself from the thousandfold play of the light . on both sides i had windows opening over these unexplored depths . the darkness in the lounge enhanced the brightness outside , and we stared as if this clear glass were the window of an immense aquarium .",16
"nothing could be seen of the ship , all her lights being extinguished , and if she was still in sight of the island , her whereabouts could not be discovered .",10
"i took one last look at the natural wonders and artistic treasures amassed in the museum , this unrivaled collection doomed to perish someday in the depths of the seas , together with its curator . i wanted to establish one supreme impression in my mind . i stayed there an hour , basking in the aura of the ceiling lights , passing in review the treasures shining in their glass cases . then i returned to my stateroom . there i dressed in sturdy seafaring clothes . i gathered my notes and packed them tenderly about my person . my heart was pounding mightily . i could n't curb its pulsations . my anxiety and agitation would certainly have given me away if captain nemo had seen me .",60

"they were light and active , and pencroft , as a sailor , accustomed to run up the masts and shrouds , was able to give them lessons .",2

cyrus harding then thought of exploring in the half - light the large circular layer which supported the upper cone of the mountain .,10
"i realized what had happened . the nautilus had just started off at great speed . all the tranquil glimmers of the ice walls had then changed into blazing streaks . the sparkles from these myriads of diamonds were merging with each other . swept along by its propeller , the nautilus was traveling through a sheath of flashing light .",59

"ayrton then , followed by pencroft , crossed it with a rapid step , scaring the birds nestled in the holes of the rocks ; then , without hesitating , he plunged into the sea , and swam noiselessly in the direction of the ship , in which a few lights had recently appeared , showing her exact situation .",50

"from january 21 to the 23rd , the nautilus traveled at the rate of 250 leagues in twenty - four hours , hence 540 miles at twenty - two miles per hour . if , during our trip , we were able to identify these different varieties of fish , it 's because they were attracted by our electric light and tried to follow alongside ; but most of them were outdistanced by our speed and soon fell behind ; temporarily , however , a few managed to keep pace in the nautilus 's waters .",59
"i opened the door leading to the library . the same inadequate light , the same solitude . i went to man my post near the door opening into the well of the central companionway . i waited for ned land 's signal .",12

"i say 150 meters , although i had no instruments for estimating this distance . but i knew that the sun 's rays , even in the clearest seas , could reach no deeper . so at precisely this point the darkness became profound . not a single object was visible past ten paces . consequently , i had begun to grope my way when suddenly i saw the glow of an intense white light . captain nemo had just activated his electric device . his companion did likewise . conseil and i followed suit . by turning a switch , i established contact between the induction coil and the glass spiral , and the sea , lit up by our four lanterns , was illuminated for a radius of twenty - five meters .",117

"while we were walking , i thought the lights of our ruhmkorff devices would automatically attract some inhabitants of these dark strata . but if they did approach us , at least they kept at a distance regrettable from the hunter 's standpoint . several times i saw captain nemo stop and take aim with his rifle ; then , after sighting down its barrel for a few seconds , he would straighten up and resume his walk .",8
"our return journey began . captain nemo resumed the lead in our little band , always heading forward without hesitation . i noted that we did n't follow the same path in returning to the nautilus . this new route , very steep and hence very arduous , quickly took us close to the surface of the sea . but this return to the upper strata was n't so sudden that decompression took place too quickly , which could have led to serious organic disorders and given us those internal injuries so fatal to divers . with great promptness , the light reappeared and grew stronger ; and the refraction of the sun , already low on the horizon , again ringed the edges of various objects with the entire color spectrum .",101
"the reporter then proposed to light a fire on a point of the islet , which would serve as a signal to the engineer .",5
"where the sun had gone down in simple state -- pure of the pomp of clouds -- spread a solemn purple , burning with the light of red jewel and furnace flame at one point , on one hill - peak , and extending high and wide , soft and still softer , over half heaven .",25

"half an hour had already gone by without our situation changing , when our eyes were suddenly spirited from utter darkness into blinding light . our prison lit up all at once ; in other words , it filled with luminescent matter so intense that at first i could n't stand the brightness of it . from its glare and whiteness , i recognized the electric glow that had played around this underwater boat like some magnificent phosphorescent phenomenon . after involuntarily closing my eyes , i reopened them and saw that this luminous force came from a frosted half globe curving out of the cabin 's ceiling .",27

"shaking my hair from my eyes , i lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room ; at this moment a light gleamed on the wall .",25
"i can now conjecture readily that this streak of light was , in all likelihood , a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn : but then , prepared as my mind was for horror , shaken as my nerves were by agitation , i thought the swift darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world . my heart beat thick , my head grew hot ; a sound filled my ears , which i deemed the rushing of wings ; something seemed near me ; i was oppressed , suffocated : endurance broke down ; i rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort .",9
"after half an hour of walking , the seafloor grew rocky . jellyfish , microscopic crustaceans , and sea - pen coral lit it faintly with their phosphorescent glimmers . i glimpsed piles of stones covered by a couple million zoophytes and tangles of algae . my feet often slipped on this viscous seaweed carpet , and without my alpenstock i would have fallen more than once . when i turned around , i could still see the nautilus 's whitish beacon , which was starting to grow pale in the distance .",22
"so much smoke , and possibly scoriae and cinders were mingled with them , that their light gleamed but faintly amid the gloom of the night .",16

"what a sight ! how can i describe it ! how can i portray these woods and rocks in this liquid setting , their lower parts dark and sullen , their upper parts tinted red in this light whose intensity was doubled by the reflecting power of the waters ! we scaled rocks that crumbled behind us , collapsing in enormous sections with the hollow rumble of an avalanche . to our right and left there were carved gloomy galleries where the eye lost its way . huge glades opened up , seemingly cleared by the hand of man , and i sometimes wondered whether some residents of these underwater regions would suddenly appear before me .",37

"we were , as i have said , in the dining - room : the lustre , which had been lit for dinner , filled the room with a festal breadth of light ; the large fire was all red and clear ; the purple curtains hung rich and ample before the lofty window and loftier arch ; everything was still , save the subdued chat of adele ( she dared not speak loud ) , and , filling up each pause , the beating of winter rain against the panes .",20

"certainly , when formerly lighted up by intelligence , this man 's face must have had a sort of beauty .",4
""" with windows to light them ! "" said herbert , laughing .",4
"this caused pencroft , who would only look at the matter in the light of a joke , to exclaim,--",13
""" wait a little while . our beacon is about to go on , and if you want some light on the subject , you 'll be satisfied . """,19
beneath their eyes was spread a sheet of snow which looked gray in the dim light .,15
"in the event of this , the cart would have been of more use than the light canoe , but it was heavy and clumsy to drag , and therefore more difficult to use ; this led pencroft to express his regret that the chest had not contained , besides "" his halfpound of tobacco , "" a pair of strong new jersey horses , which would have been very useful to the colony !",16
"i related to him what the final deeds of captain dumont d'urville had brought to light , deeds described here in this heavily condensed summary of the whole matter .",15
"faithful to his mission of vengeance , athos had requested to be conducted to the garden ; and there upon the sand following the light steps of this woman , who left sharp tracks wherever she went , he advanced toward the gate which led into the wood , and causing it to be opened , he went out into the forest .",24
"the night passed quietly , for the breeze died away with the last light of day , and only rose again with the first streaks of dawn .",13
"the curtains were half drawn , and only admitted the mysterious light calculated for beatific reveries .",11
"at an elevation of about thirty meters , the nature of the terrain changed without becoming any easier . pudding stones and trachyte gave way to black basaltic rock : here , lying in slabs all swollen with blisters ; there , shaped like actual prisms and arranged into a series of columns that supported the springings of this immense vault , a wonderful sample of natural architecture . then , among this basaltic rock , there snaked long , hardened lava flows inlaid with veins of bituminous coal and in places covered by wide carpets of sulfur . the sunshine coming through the crater had grown stronger , shedding a hazy light over all the volcanic waste forever buried in the heart of this extinct mountain .",112
"it is no devil , i assure you ; or if it be , it has put on the robes of an angel of light . i think i must admit so fair a guest when it asks entrance to my heart . """,24
"i did not observe her at first , nor did mr . rochester . the lamp was lit . the clock was on the stroke of twelve .",17
"near 5:30 the first glimmers of light on the horizon defined the upper lines of the coast with greater distinctness . fairly flat to the east , it swelled a little toward the south . five miles still separated it from us , and its beach merged with the misty waters . between us and the shore , the sea was deserted . not a boat , not a diver . profound solitude reigned over this gathering place of pearl fishermen . as captain nemo had commented , we were arriving in these waterways a month too soon .",6
"at certain turns in the trail we were going along , the lake appeared in its full expanse . the ship 's beacon lit up that whole placid surface , which experienced neither ripples nor undulations . the nautilus lay perfectly still . on its platform and on the embankment , crewmen were bustling around , black shadows that stood out clearly in the midst of the luminous air .",23
"at one moment he advanced so far , that by the light from a revolver he was seen surrounded by five or six large colpeos , with whom he was coping with great coolness .",11
""" our lighting equipment would be useless to us , "" the captain answered me . "" we wo n't be going very deep , and the sun 's rays will be sufficient to light our way . besides , it 's unwise to carry electric lanterns under these waves . their brightness might unexpectedly attract certain dangerous occupants of these waterways . """,34
"it was necessary to bring the case to granite house , and the colonists employed themselves in rendering their heavy cart lighter and more manageable .",21
""" yes , "" replied herbert , "" and this time we shall have no obliging engineer to light a fire to guide us into port ! """,18
"the sun was already sending sufficient light under these waves . the tiniest objects remained visible . after ten minutes of walking , we were in five meters of water , and the terrain had become almost flat .",6
"so i begged ned to let me think about it before taking action . if this measure proved fruitless , it could arouse the captain 's suspicions , make our circumstances even more arduous , and jeopardize the canadian 's plans . i might add that i could hardly use our state of health as an argument . except for that grueling ordeal under the ice bank at the south pole , we had never felt better , neither ned , conseil , nor i. the nutritious food , life - giving air , regular routine , and uniform temperature kept illness at bay ; and for a man who did n't miss his past existence on land , for a captain nemo who was at home here , who went where he wished , who took paths mysterious to others if not himself in attaining his ends , i could understand such a life . but we ourselves had n't severed all ties with humanity . for my part , i did n't want my new and unusual research to be buried with my bones . i had now earned the right to pen the definitive book on the sea , and sooner or later i wanted that book to see the light of day .",213
"and as if he only felt strength to detach himself by a violent effort from the hand he held , he sprang away , running , while mme . bonacieux knocked , as at the shutter , three light and regular taps . when he had gained the angle of the street , he turned . the door had been opened , and shut again ; the mercer ’s pretty wife had disappeared .",38
"by april 20 we had risen to an average level of 1,500 meters . the nearest land was the island group of the bahamas , scattered like a batch of cobblestones over the surface of the water . there high underwater cliffs reared up , straight walls made of craggy chunks arranged like big stone foundations , among which there gaped black caves so deep our electric rays could n't light them to the far ends .",70
"the "" nautilus "" was there no longer to illuminate the cavern with its electric light .",15
"she , with a still - smiling countenance , took his arm , and passed with him under a low arched door , which by a vaulted passage , lighted only at the farther end , led to a stone staircase around an angle of stone . they then came to a massive door , which after the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with him , turned heavily upon its hinges , and disclosed the chamber destined for milady .",29
one window was lighted .,3
"cyrus harding then , standing up , cast the light of the lamp upon the walls of the cavern which separated it from the central shaft of the volcano .",9
"he filled it himself , lighted it with a glowing coal , and appeared to be the happiest of quadrumana .",5
"i attach a print of the positive . in it you can view these primordial rocks that have never seen the light of day , this nether granite that forms the powerful foundation of our globe , the deep caves cut into the stony mass , the outlines of incomparable distinctness whose far edges stand out in black as if from the brush of certain flemish painters . in the distance is a mountainous horizon , a wondrously undulating line that makes up the background of this landscape . the general effect of these smooth rocks is indescribable : black , polished , without moss or other blemish , carved into strange shapes , sitting firmly on a carpet of sand that sparkled beneath our streams of electric light .",128
"miss gryce snored at last ; she was a heavy welshwoman , and till now her habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light than as a nuisance ; to - night i hailed the first deep notes with satisfaction ; i was debarrassed of interruption ; my half - effaced thought instantly revived .",28
"my eye was quickly at the aperture . celine 's chamber - maid entered , lit a lamp , left it on the table , and withdrew .",15
"on returning to the surface , in the half light , he felt a living creature struggling near him .",9
"if the engineer had had only to deal with wild beasts , jaguars or others , he would have simply lighted fires all around his camp , which would have sufficed for its defense ; but the convicts would be rather attracted than terrified by the flames , and it was , therefore , better to be surrounded by the profound darkness of night .",20
""" oh , that is the light in which you view it !",6
"a light was struck by neb , and in a few moments the lantern was lighted and the light thrown into every corner of the room .",1

"a light was struck by neb , and in a few moments the lantern was lighted and the light thrown into every corner of the room .",18
"i then entered a dining room , decorated and furnished in austere good taste . inlaid with ebony trim , tall oaken sideboards stood at both ends of this room , and sparkling on their shelves were staggered rows of earthenware , porcelain , and glass of incalculable value . there silver - plated dinnerware gleamed under rays pouring from light fixtures in the ceiling , whose glare was softened and tempered by delicately painted designs .",60
"neb took the lighted lantern , and all left the corral .",3
""" no , cyrus , "" answered the reporter , "" it was certainly a fire lighted by the hand of man .",16
""" she has the most beautiful light hair imaginable ! """,6
"it was a library . tall , black - rosewood bookcases , inlaid with copperwork , held on their wide shelves a large number of uniformly bound books . these furnishings followed the contours of the room , their lower parts leading to huge couches upholstered in maroon leather and curved for maximum comfort . light , movable reading stands , which could be pushed away or pulled near as desired , allowed books to be positioned on them for easy study . in the center stood a huge table covered with pamphlets , among which some newspapers , long out of date , were visible . electric light flooded this whole harmonious totality , falling from four frosted half globes set in the scrollwork of the ceiling . i stared in genuine wonderment at this room so ingeniously laid out , and i could n't believe my eyes .",55

"i took the cigar offered me , whose shape recalled those from cuba ; but it seemed to be made of gold leaf . i lit it at a small brazier supported by an elegant bronze stand , and i inhaled my first whiffs with the relish of a smoker who has n't had a puff in days .",25
"just then captain nemo opened a door facing the one by which i had entered the library , and i passed into an immense , splendidly lit lounge .",26
"the sailor had at first lighted a fire in the hut , which was not wanting in things necessary for life .",5
"the two found themselves in a small chapel covered with a tapestry of persian silk worked with gold , and brilliantly lighted with a vast number of candles .",21
"after the works of art , natural rarities predominated . they consisted chiefly of plants , shells , and other exhibits from the ocean that must have been captain nemo 's own personal finds . in the middle of the lounge , a jet of water , electrically lit , fell back into a basin made from a single giant clam . the delicately festooned rim of this shell , supplied by the biggest mollusk in the class acephala , measured about six meters in circumference ; so it was even bigger than those fine giant clams given to king françois i by the republic of venice , and which the church of saint - sulpice in paris has made into two gigantic holy - water fonts .",48
""" you talk about sperm whales , "" he said , "" as if they were little beasts ! but there are stories of gigantic sperm whales . they 're shrewd cetaceans . i hear that some will cover themselves with algae and fucus plants . people mistake them for islets . they pitch camp on top , make themselves at home , light a fire-- """,63
""" we did not leave granite house , "" answered cyrus harding , "" and if a fire appeared on the coast , it was lighted by another hand than ours ! """,25
"she then turned to the right , followed the course of a long corridor , descended a flight , went a few steps farther , introduced a key into a lock , opened a door , and pushed the duke into an apartment lighted only by a lamp , saying , "" remain here , my lord duke ; someone will come . """,43
""" that locality lies a little above suez in a sound that used to form a deep estuary when the red sea stretched as far as the bitter lakes . now , whether or not their crossing was literally miraculous , the israelites did cross there in returning to the promised land , and the pharaoh 's army did perish at precisely that locality . so i think that excavating those sands would bring to light a great many weapons and tools of egyptian origin .

""" it is like ! "" he murmured ; "" the eye is well managed : the colour , light , expression , are perfect . it smiles ! """,19
"lastly , her hair , which , from being light in her youth , had become chestnut , and which she wore curled very plainly , and with much powder , admirably set off her face , in which the most rigid critic could only have desired a little less rouge , and the most fastidious sculptor a little more fineness in the nose .",9
""" i 'm not so certain they 'll find it , "" captain nemo replied icily . "" but be that as it may , you 're already familiar with the first use i 've found for this valuable force . it lights us , and with a uniformity and continuity not even possessed by sunlight . now , look at that clock : it 's electric , it runs with an accuracy rivaling the finest chronometers . i 've had it divided into twenty - four hours like italian clocks , since neither day nor night , sun nor moon , exist for me , but only this artificial light that i import into the depths of the seas ! see , right now it 's ten o'clock in the morning .

"at a sign from cyrus harding the oars again plunged into the water , causing a regular shower of gems , and the boat was urged forward towards the light , which was now not more than half a cable 's length distant .",29
"and yet , at the very door the musketeer began to entertain some doubts . the approach was not such as to prepossess people -- an ill - smelling , dark passage , a staircase half - lighted by bars through which stole a glimmer from a neighboring yard ; on the first floor a low door studded with enormous nails , like the principal gate of the grand chatelet .",37
""" surely . an excellent longboat , light and unsinkable , which is used for excursions and fishing trips . """,7
