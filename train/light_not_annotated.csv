"a week later dorian gray was sitting in the conservatory at selby royal , talking to the pretty duchess of monmouth , who with her husband , a jaded - looking man of sixty , was amongst his guests . it was tea- time , and the mellow light of the huge , lace - covered lamp that stood on the table lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service at which the duchess was presiding . her white hands were moving daintily among the cups , and her full red lips were smiling at something that dorian had whispered to her . lord henry was lying back in a silk - draped wicker chair , looking at them . on a peach - coloured divan sat lady narborough , pretending to listen to the duke 's description of the last brazilian beetle that he had added to his collection . three young men in elaborate smoking - suits were handing tea - cakes to some of the women . the house - party consisted of twelve people , and there were more expected to arrive on the next day .",62

"towards two o'clock in the afternoon , while it was snowing hard , long whistles were heard approaching from the east . a great shadow , preceded by a wild light , slowly advanced , appearing still larger through the mist , which gave it a fantastic aspect . no train was expected from the east , neither had there been time for the succour asked for by telegraph to arrive ; the train from omaha to san francisco was not due till the next day . the mystery was soon explained .",30

"the front door was open , so we rushed in and hurried from room to room to the amazement of a doddering old manservant , who met us in the passage . there was no light save in the dining - room , but holmes caught up the lamp and left no corner of the house unexplored . no sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing . on the upper floor , however , one of the bedroom doors was locked .",35
"the vessel was two miles off . it drew nearer , always moving toward the phosphorescent glow that signaled the nautilus 's presence . i saw its green and red running lights , plus the white lantern hanging from the large stay of its foremast . hazy flickerings were reflected on its rigging and indicated that its furnaces were pushed to the limit . showers of sparks and cinders of flaming coal escaped from its funnels , spangling the air with stars .",31

"and if nothing happens without his knowledge , he knows that i am here , and am in this dreadful condition ; and if nothing happens without his appointment , he has appointed all this to befall me . nothing occurred to my thought to contradict any of these conclusions , and therefore it rested upon me with the greater force , that it must needs be that god had appointed all this to befall me ; that i was brought into this miserable circumstance by his direction , he having the sole power , not of me only , but of everything that happened in the world . immediately it followed : why has god done this to me ? what have i done to be thus used ? my conscience presently checked me in that inquiry , as if i had blasphemed , and methought it spoke to me like a voice : “ wretch ! dost _ thou _ ask what thou hast done ? look back upon a dreadful misspent life , and ask thyself what thou hast _ not _ done ? ask , why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed ? why wert thou not drowned in yarmouth roads ; killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the sallee man - of - war ; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of africa ; or drowned _ here _ , when all the crew perished but thyself ? dost _ thou _ ask , what have i done ? ” i was struck dumb with these reflections , as one astonished , and had not a word to say — no , not to answer to myself , but rose up pensive and sad , walked back to my retreat , and went up over my wall , as if i had been going to bed ; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed , and i had no inclination to sleep ; so i sat down in my chair , and lighted my lamp , for it began to be dark . now , as the apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me very much , it occurred to my thought that the brazilians take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers , and i had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests , which was quite cured , and some also that was green , and not quite cured .",345

"alice was not a bit hurt , and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment : she looked up , but it was all dark overhead ; before her was another long passage , and the white rabbit was still in sight , hurrying down it . there was not a moment to be lost : away went alice like the wind , and was just in time to hear it say , as it turned a corner , ' oh my ears and whiskers , how late it 's getting !

"the weather -- if we may use that term -- will change before long . the atmosphere is charged with vapours , pervaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of saline waters . the clouds are sinking lower , and assume an olive hue . the electric light can scarcely penetrate through the dense curtain which has dropped over the theatre on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged .",48
"i can now conjecture readily that this streak of light was , in all likelihood , a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn : but then , prepared as my mind was for horror , shaken as my nerves were by agitation , i thought the swift darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world . my heart beat thick , my head grew hot ; a sound filled my ears , which i deemed the rushing of wings ; something seemed near me ; i was oppressed , suffocated : endurance broke down ; i rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort .",9

"while he took his sights with his sextant , one of the nautilus 's sailors-- that muscular man who had gone with us to crespo island during our first underwater excursion -- came up to clean the glass panes of the beacon . i then examined the fittings of this mechanism , whose power was increased a hundredfold by biconvex lenses that were designed like those in a lighthouse and kept its rays productively focused . this electric lamp was so constructed as to yield its maximum illuminating power . in essence , its light was generated in a vacuum , insuring both its steadiness and intensity . such a vacuum also reduced wear on the graphite points between which the luminous arc expanded . this was an important savings for captain nemo , who could n't easily renew them . but under these conditions , wear and tear were almost nonexistent .",94
"from january 21 to the 23rd , the nautilus traveled at the rate of 250 leagues in twenty - four hours , hence 540 miles at twenty - two miles per hour . if , during our trip , we were able to identify these different varieties of fish , it 's because they were attracted by our electric light and tried to follow alongside ; but most of them were outdistanced by our speed and soon fell behind ; temporarily , however , a few managed to keep pace in the nautilus 's waters .",59

"soon , in the shadows , i spotted a pale signal light glimmering a mile away , half discolored by mist .",11
""" that 's the floating signal light of suez , "" he went on . "" it wo n't be long before we reach the entrance to the tunnel . """,6
"if the engineer had had only to deal with wild beasts , jaguars or others , he would have simply lighted fires all around his camp , which would have sufficed for its defense ; but the convicts would be rather attracted than terrified by the flames , and it was , therefore , better to be surrounded by the profound darkness of night .",20
"the cabin was dark ; but my eyes soon grew accustomed to its darkness and i saw the pilot , a muscular man whose hands rested on the pegs of the wheel . outside , the sea was brightly lit by the beacon shining behind the cabin at the other end of the platform .",39
"along the narrow walls of this passageway , i saw only brilliant streaks , hard lines , fiery furrows , all scrawled by our speeding electric light . with my hand i tried to curb the pounding of my heart .",26
"the curtains were half drawn , and only admitted the mysterious light calculated for beatific reveries .",11
""" you will bring lights , and relieve the sentinel , "" continued felton .",4
"pencroft had kept his promise , and a light boat , the shell of which was joined together by the flexible twigs of the crejimba , had been constructed in five days .",8
"i did not observe her at first , nor did mr . rochester . the lamp was lit . the clock was on the stroke of twelve .",17
"now , they had been talking in the room for a few minutes , when a light knock was heard at the door .",16
"all is still : he again advances : he bends above her ; a light veil rests on her features : he lifts it , bends lower ; now his eyes anticipate the vision of beauty -- warm , and blooming , and lovely , in rest .",14
how we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back !,5
"on returning to the surface , in the half light , he felt a living creature struggling near him .",9
"she was a big woman , and had long black hair : we could see it streaming against the flames as she stood . i witnessed , and several more witnessed , mr . rochester ascend through the sky - light on to the roof ; we heard him call ' bertha ! '",40
"the studio was filled with the rich odour of roses , and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden , there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac , or the more delicate perfume of the pink - flowering thorn .",14
what a strange light inspired them ! what an extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me ! how the new feeling bore me up !,3
"i remember it now , and i know that it was the effluence of fine intellect , of true courage ; it lit up her marked lineaments , her thin face , her sunken grey eye , like a reflection from the aspect of an angel .",22
"i proceeded : at last my way opened , the trees thinned a little ; presently i beheld a railing , then the house -- scarce , by this dim light , distinguishable from the trees ; so dank and green were its decaying walls .",30
"in the midst of the watery mass , brightly lit by our electric beams , there snaked past those one - meter lampreys that are common to nearly every clime . a type of ray from the genus oxyrhynchus , five feet wide , had a white belly with a spotted , ash - gray back and was carried along by the currents like a huge , wide - open shawl . other rays passed by so quickly i could n't tell if they deserved that name "" eagle ray "" coined by the ancient greeks , or those designations of "" rat ray , "" "" bat ray , "" and "" toad ray "" that modern fishermen have inflicted on them . dogfish known as topes , twelve feet long and especially feared by divers , were racing with each other . looking like big bluish shadows , thresher sharks went by , eight feet long and gifted with an extremely acute sense of smell . dorados from the genus sparus , some measuring up to thirteen decimeters , appeared in silver and azure costumes encircled with ribbons , which contrasted with the dark color of their fins ; fish sacred to the goddess venus , their eyes set in brows of gold ; a valuable species that patronizes all waters fresh or salt , equally at home in rivers , lakes , and oceans , living in every clime , tolerating any temperature , their line dating back to prehistoric times on this earth yet preserving all its beauty from those far - off days . magnificent sturgeons , nine to ten meters long and extremely fast , banged their powerful tails against the glass of our panels , showing bluish backs with small brown spots ; they resemble sharks , without equaling their strength , and are encountered in every sea ; in the spring they delight in swimming up the great rivers , fighting the currents of the volga , danube , po , rhine , loire , and oder , while feeding on herring , mackerel , salmon , and codfish ; although they belong to the class of cartilaginous fish , they rate as a delicacy ; they 're eaten fresh , dried , marinated , or salt - preserved , and in olden times they were borne in triumph to the table of the roman epicure lucullus . but whenever the nautilus drew near the surface , those denizens of the mediterranean i could observe most productively belonged to the sixty - third genus of bony fish . these were tuna from the genus scomber , blue - black on top , silver on the belly armor , their dorsal stripes giving off a golden gleam . they are said to follow ships in search of refreshing shade from the hot tropical sun , and they did just that with the nautilus , as they had once done with the vessels of the count de la pérouse . for long hours they competed in speed with our submersible . i could n't stop marveling at these animals so perfectly cut out for racing , their heads small , their bodies sleek , spindle - shaped , and in some cases over three meters long , their pectoral fins gifted with remarkable strength , their caudal fins forked . like certain flocks of birds , whose speed they equal , these tuna swim in triangle formation , which prompted the ancients to say they 'd boned up on geometry and military strategy . and yet they ca n't escape the provençal fishermen , who prize them as highly as did the ancient inhabitants of turkey and italy ; and these valuable animals , as oblivious as if they were deaf and blind , leap right into the marseilles tuna nets and perish by the thousands .",9
