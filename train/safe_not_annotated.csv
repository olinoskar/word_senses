""" it is possible that stapleton did not know of the existence of an heir in canada . in any case he would very soon learn it from his friend dr . mortimer , and he was told by the latter all details about the arrival of henry baskerville . stapleton 's first idea was that this young stranger from canada might possibly be done to death in london without coming down to devonshire at all . he distrusted his wife ever since she had refused to help him in laying a trap for the old man , and he dared not leave her long out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her . it was for this reason that he took her to london with him . they lodged , i find , at the mexborough private hotel , in craven street , which was actually one of those called upon by my agent in search of evidence . here he kept his wife imprisoned in her room while he , disguised in a beard , followed dr . mortimer to baker street and afterwards to the station and to the northumberland hotel . his wife had some inkling of his plans ; but she had such a fear of her husband -- a fear founded upon brutal ill - treatment -- that she dare not write to warn the man whom she knew to be in danger . if the letter should fall into stapleton 's hands her own life would not be safe . eventually , as we know , she adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would form the message , and addressing the letter in a disguised hand . it reached the baronet , and gave him the first warning of his danger .",260
