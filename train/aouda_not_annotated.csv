"phileas fogg gazed at the tempestuous sea , which seemed to be struggling especially to delay him , with his habitual tranquillity . he never changed countenance for an instant , though a delay of twenty hours , by making him too late for the yokohama boat , would almost inevitably cause the loss of the wager . but this man of nerve manifested neither impatience nor annoyance ; it seemed as if the storm were a part of his programme , and had been foreseen . aouda was amazed to find him as calm as he had been from the first time she saw him .",87
"aouda , on seeing the locomotive come up , hurried out of the station , and asked the conductor , "" are you going to start ? """,0
"several hours passed . the weather was dismal , and it was very cold . fix sat motionless on a bench in the station ; he might have been thought asleep . aouda , despite the storm , kept coming out of the waiting - room , going to the end of the platform , and peering through the tempest of snow , as if to pierce the mist which narrowed the horizon around her , and to hear , if possible , some welcome sound . she heard and saw nothing . then she would return , chilled through , to issue out again after the lapse of a few moments , but always in vain .",32
"aouda at first said nothing . she passed her hand across her forehead , and reflected a few moments . then , in her sweet , soft voice , she said : "" what ought i to do , mr . fogg ? """,0
"these were the only words he uttered during the journey . aouda , cosily packed in furs and cloaks , was sheltered as much as possible from the attacks of the freezing wind . as for passepartout , his face was as red as the sun 's disc when it sets in the mist , and he laboriously inhaled the biting air . with his natural buoyancy of spirits , he began to hope again . they would reach new york on the evening , if not on the morning , of the 11th , and there was still some chances that it would be before the steamer sailed for liverpool .",11
"mr . fogg left the hotel alone , after giving passepartout instructions to await his return , and inform aouda to be ready at an instant 's notice . he proceeded to the banks of the hudson , and looked about among the vessels moored or anchored in the river , for any that were about to depart . several had departure signals , and were preparing to put to sea at morning tide ; for in this immense and admirable port there is not one day in a hundred that vessels do not set out for every quarter of the globe . but they were mostly sailing vessels , of which , of course , phileas fogg could make no use .",19
""" but poor passepartout ? "" urged aouda , who was much disturbed by the servant 's disappearance .",7
"the door swung open , and he saw passepartout , aouda , and fix , who hurried towards him .",10
"john bunsby had requested his passengers to go below ; but this imprisonment in so narrow a space , with little air , and the boat bouncing in the gale , was far from pleasant . neither mr . fogg , fix , nor aouda consented to leave the deck .",44
"at that hour phileas fogg , having stimulated the engineer by the offer of a generous reward , at last set out towards london with aouda and his faithful servant .",25
"mr . fogg called him in the morning , and told him to get aouda 's breakfast , and a cup of tea and a chop for himself . he desired aouda to excuse him from breakfast and dinner , as his time would be absorbed all day in putting his affairs to rights . in the evening he would ask permission to have a few moment 's conversation with the young lady .",31
""" what influence could i have ? "" replied aouda . "" mr . fogg is influenced by no one . has he ever understood that my gratitude to him is overflowing ? has he ever read my heart ? my friend , he must not be left alone an instant ! you say he is going to speak with me this evening ? """,9
"finding himself too wretched to remain alone , he knocked at aouda 's door , went into her room , seated himself , without speaking , in a corner , and looked ruefully at the young woman . aouda was still pensive .",38
""" i know it , mr . fogg , "" replied aouda ; "" and i ask you in my turn , will you forgive me for having followed you , and -- who knows?--for having , perhaps , delayed you , and thus contributed to your ruin ? """,11
""" so , mr . fogg , "" resumed aouda , "" not content with rescuing me from a terrible death , you thought yourself bound to secure my comfort in a foreign land ? """,9
""" at least , "" said aouda , "" want should not overtake a man like you . your friends-- """,6
"after his first depression , passepartout became calmer , and began to study his situation . it was certainly not an enviable one . he found himself on the way to japan , and what should he do when he got there ? his pocket was empty ; he had not a solitary shilling , not so much as a penny . his passage had fortunately been paid for in advance ; and he had five or six days in which to decide upon his future course . he fell to at meals with an appetite , and ate for mr . fogg , aouda , and himself . he helped himself as generously as if japan were a desert , where nothing to eat was to be looked for .",104
""" mr . fogg , "" said aouda , rising and seizing his hand , "" do you wish at once a kinswoman and friend ? will you have me for your wife ? """,7
""" for to - morrow , monday , "" said mr . fogg , turning to aouda .",16
"there was a full complement of passengers on board , among them english , many americans , a large number of coolies on their way to california , and several east indian officers , who were spending their vacation in making the tour of the world . nothing of moment happened on the voyage ; the steamer , sustained on its large paddles , rolled but little , and the pacific almost justified its name . mr . fogg was as calm and taciturn as ever . his young companion felt herself more and more attached to him by other ties than gratitude ; his silent but generous nature impressed her more than she thought ; and it was almost unconsciously that she yielded to emotions which did not seem to have the least effect upon her protector . aouda took the keenest interest in his plans , and became impatient at any incident which seemed likely to retard his journey .",139
""" dear aouda ! "" replied phileas fogg .",2
""" no doubt , "" returned mr . fogg , "" by not crossing india . but if i had not crossed india , i should not have saved aouda ; she would not have been my wife , and-- """,29
"aouda , leaning upon mr . fogg 's arm , observed the tumultuous scene with surprise , while fix asked a man near him what the cause of it all was . before the man could reply , a fresh agitation arose ; hurrahs and excited shouts were heard ; the staffs of the banners began to be used as offensive weapons ; and fists flew about in every direction . thumps were exchanged from the tops of the carriages and omnibuses which had been blocked up in the crowd . boots and shoes went whirling through the air , and mr . fogg thought he even heard the crack of revolvers mingling in the din , the rout approached the stairway , and flowed over the lower step . one of the parties had evidently been repulsed ; but the mere lookers - on could not tell whether mandiboy or camerfield had gained the upper hand .",0
"such a visit was , indeed , opportune . the clothing of both mr . fogg and fix was in rags , as if they had themselves been actively engaged in the contest between camerfield and mandiboy . an hour after , they were once more suitably attired , and with aouda returned to the international hotel .",51
"passepartout was waiting for his master , armed with half a dozen six - barrelled revolvers . when he perceived fix , he knit his brows ; but aouda having , in a few words , told him of their adventure , his countenance resumed its placid expression . fix evidently was no longer an enemy , but an ally ; he was faithfully keeping his word .",28
"the worthy indian then gave some account of the victim , who , he said , was a celebrated beauty of the parsee race , and the daughter of a wealthy bombay merchant . she had received a thoroughly english education in that city , and , from her manners and intelligence , would be thought an european . her name was aouda . left an orphan , she was married against her will to the old rajah of bundelcund ; and , knowing the fate that awaited her , she escaped , was retaken , and devoted by the rajah 's relatives , who had an interest in her death , to the sacrifice from which it seemed she could not escape .",62
""" certainly , sir , "" aouda quickly replied ; "" i understand whist . it is part of an english education . """,6
"passepartout was dispatched in search of the steward , and soon returned with two packs of cards , some pins , counters , and a shelf covered with cloth . the game commenced . aouda understood whist sufficiently well , and even received some compliments on her playing from mr . fogg . as for the detective , he was simply an adept , and worthy of being matched against his present opponent .",34
"aouda and fix feared that mr . fogg might take it into his head to get out ; but that gentleman contented himself with saying to his servant , "" see what is the matter . """,0
"soon after , phileas fogg , sir francis cromarty , and passepartout , installed in a carriage with aouda , who had the best seat , were whirling at full speed towards benares . it was a run of eighty miles , and was accomplished in two hours . during the journey , the young woman fully recovered her senses .",18
"the train entered the station , and passepartout jumping out first , was followed by mr . fogg , who assisted his fair companion to descend . phileas fogg intended to proceed at once to the hong kong steamer , in order to get aouda comfortably settled for the voyage . he was unwilling to leave her while they were still on dangerous ground .",44
"phileas fogg contented himself with saying that it was impossible . it was quite unlikely that he should be arrested for preventing a suttee . the complainants would not dare present themselves with such a charge . there was some mistake . moreover , he would not , in any event , abandon aouda , but would escort her to hong kong .",53
"aouda turned pale , and her blood ran cold . she seized mr . fogg 's arm and gently pulled him back . passepartout was ready to pounce upon the american , who was staring insolently at his opponent . but fix got up , and , going to colonel proctor said , "" you forget that it is i with whom you have to deal , sir ; for it was i whom you not only insulted , but struck ! """,0
"aouda in vain attempted to retain mr . fogg ; as vainly did the detective endeavour to make the quarrel his . passepartout wished to throw the colonel out of the window , but a sign from his master checked him . phileas fogg left the car , and the american followed him upon the platform . "" sir , "" said mr . fogg to his adversary , "" i am in a great hurry to get back to europe , and any delay whatever will be greatly to my disadvantage . """,0
"at eleven o'clock the locomotive 's whistle announced that they were approaching plum creek station . mr . fogg rose , and , followed by fix , went out upon the platform . passepartout accompanied him , carrying a pair of revolvers . aouda remained in the car , as pale as death .",43
"the rangoon -- one of the peninsular and oriental company 's boats plying in the chinese and japanese seas -- was a screw steamer , built of iron , weighing about seventeen hundred and seventy tons , and with engines of four hundred horse - power . she was as fast , but not as well fitted up , as the mongolia , and aouda was not as comfortably provided for on board of her as phileas fogg could have wished . however , the trip from calcutta to hong kong only comprised some three thousand five hundred miles , occupying from ten to twelve days , and the young woman was not difficult to please .",64
"during the first days of the journey aouda became better acquainted with her protector , and constantly gave evidence of her deep gratitude for what he had done . the phlegmatic gentleman listened to her , apparently at least , with coldness , neither his voice nor his manner betraying the slightest emotion ; but he seemed to be always on the watch that nothing should be wanting to aouda 's comfort . he visited her regularly each day at certain hours , not so much to talk himself , as to sit and hear her talk . he treated her with the strictest politeness , but with the precision of an automaton , the movements of which had been arranged for this purpose . aouda did not quite know what to make of him , though passepartout had given her some hints of his master 's eccentricity , and made her smile by telling her of the wager which was sending him round the world . after all , she owed phileas fogg her life , and she always regarded him through the exalting medium of her gratitude .",125
"passepartout thereupon recounted aouda 's history , the affair at the bombay pagoda , the purchase of the elephant for two thousand pounds , the rescue , the arrest , and sentence of the calcutta court , and the restoration of mr . fogg and himself to liberty on bail . fix , who was familiar with the last events , seemed to be equally ignorant of all that passepartout related ; and the later was charmed to find so interested a listener .",3
"aouda was safe ; and phileas fogg , who had been in the thickest of the fight , had not received a scratch . fix was slightly wounded in the arm . but passepartout was not to be found , and tears coursed down aouda 's cheeks .",0
"aouda was safe ; and phileas fogg , who had been in the thickest of the fight , had not received a scratch . fix was slightly wounded in the arm . but passepartout was not to be found , and tears coursed down aouda 's cheeks .",44
"mr . fogg , with folded arms , remained motionless . he had a serious decision to make . aouda , standing near him , looked at him without speaking , and he understood her look . if his servant was a prisoner , ought he not to risk everything to rescue him from the indians ?",19
