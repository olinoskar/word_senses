"after half an hour of walking , the seafloor grew rocky . jellyfish , microscopic crustaceans , and sea - pen coral lit it faintly with their phosphorescent glimmers . i glimpsed piles of stones covered by a couple million zoophytes and tangles of algae . my feet often slipped on this viscous seaweed carpet , and without my alpenstock i would have fallen more than once . when i turned around , i could still see the nautilus 's whitish beacon , which was starting to grow pale in the distance .",87,"('grow', 'pâlir', 'palidecer')",2

"but this forest was only composed of coniferae , such as deodaras , already recognized by herbert , and douglas pine , similar to those which grow on the northwest coast of america , and splendid firs , measuring a hundred and fifty feet in height .",26,"('grow', 'pousser', 'crecer')",4

"about twelve , immense shoals of seaweeds came in sight . i was aware of the great powers of vegetation that characterise these plants , which grow at a depth of twelve thousand feet , reproduce themselves under a pressure of four hundred atmospheres , and sometimes form barriers strong enough to impede the course of a ship . but never , i think , were such seaweeds as those which we saw floating in immense waving lines upon the sea of liedenbrock .",26,"('grow', 'ramper', 'arrastrar')",6
"there fermented in that sublimated brain plans so vast , projects so tumultuous , that there remained no room for any capricious or material love -- that sentiment which is fed by leisure and grows with corruption .",34,"('grow', 'grandir', 'crecer')",3

"soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table : she opened it , and found in it a very small cake , on which the words ' eat me ' were beautifully marked in currants . ' well , i 'll eat it , ' said alice , ' and if it makes me grow larger , i can reach the key ; and if it makes me grow smaller , i can creep under the door ; so either way i 'll get into the garden , and i do n't care which happens !

"' here ! ' cried alice , quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes , and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury - box with the edge of her skirt , upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below , and there they lay sprawling about , reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before .",19,"('grow', 'grandir', 'crecer')",3
"' and yet what a dear little puppy it was ! ' said alice , as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself , and fanned herself with one of the leaves : ' i should have liked teaching it tricks very much , if -- if i 'd only been the right size to do it ! oh dear ! i 'd nearly forgotten that i 've got to grow up again ! let me see -- how is it to be managed ? i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other ; but the great question is , what ?
