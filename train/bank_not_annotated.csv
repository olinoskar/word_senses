"on the bank of the river the executioner approached milady , and bound her hands and feet .",2
"thus it happened that the wild animals , jaguars , wild boars , capybaras , koalas , and game of every kind , mad with terror , had fled to the banks of the mercy and to the tadorn marsh , beyond the road to port balloon .",31
the ice bank,2
"however , during the day of march 16 , these tracts of ice completely barred our path . it was n't the ice bank as yet , just huge ice fields cemented together by the cold . this obstacle could n't stop captain nemo , and he launched his ship against the ice fields with hideous violence . the nautilus went into these brittle masses like a wedge , splitting them with dreadful cracklings . it was an old - fashioned battering ram propelled with infinite power . hurled aloft , ice rubble fell back around us like hail . through brute force alone , the submersible carved out a channel for itself . carried away by its momentum , the ship sometimes mounted on top of these tracts of ice and crushed them with its weight , or at other times , when cooped up beneath the ice fields , it split them with simple pitching movements , creating wide punctures .",23
""" the ice bank ! "" the canadian told me .",3
""" correct , ned land , but i still want to know what 's behind this ice bank ! behold my greatest source of irritation -- a wall ! """,17
"the sea is of no great depth at the grand banks . a few hundred fathoms at best . but to the south there is a deep , suddenly occurring depression , a 3,000-meter pit . here the gulf stream widens . its waters come to full bloom . it loses its speed and temperature , but it turns into a sea .",10
""" fine ! "" the canadian put in . "" but we already know what 's behind this ice bank . """,19
"and i 'll mention -- for the record -- some little banded blennies that follow ships into the northernmost seas , sharp - snouted carp exclusive to the north atlantic , scorpionfish , and lastly the gadoid family , chiefly the cod species , which i detected in their waters of choice over these inexhaustible grand banks .",56
""" well , professor , "" the canadian replied , "" you can just drop that idea ! you 've made it to the ice bank , which is already far enough , but you wo n't get any farther , neither your captain nemo or his nautilus . and whether he wants to or not , we 'll head north again , in other words , to the land of sensible people . """,25
"i had to agree that ned land was right , and until ships are built to navigate over tracts of ice , they 'll have to stop at the ice bank .",30
"the two lackeys conducted milady to the bank of the river . her mouth was mute ; but her eyes spoke with their inexpressible eloquence , supplicating by turns each of those on whom she looked .",7
"milady , during the passage had contrived to untie the cord which fastened her feet . on coming near the bank , she jumped lightly on shore and took to flight .",20
""" right , "" i said , carried away by the captain 's logic . "" even though the surface of the sea has solidified into ice , its lower strata are still open , thanks to that divine justice that puts the maximum density of salt water one degree above its freezing point . and if i 'm not mistaken , the submerged part of this ice bank is in a four - to - one ratio to its emerging part . """,68
"meanwhile preparations for this daring attempt were getting under way . the nautilus 's powerful pumps forced air down into the tanks and stored it under high pressure . near four o'clock captain nemo informed me that the platform hatches were about to be closed . i took a last look at the dense ice bank we were going to conquer . the weather was fair , the skies reasonably clear , the cold quite brisk , namely -12 degrees centigrade ; but after the wind had lulled , this temperature did n't seem too unbearable .",55
"about 300 meters down , just as captain nemo had predicted , we cruised beneath the undulating surface of the ice bank . but the nautilus sank deeper still . it reached a depth of 800 meters . at the surface this water gave a temperature of -12 degrees centigrade , but now it gave no more than -10 degrees . two degrees had already been gained . thanks to its heating equipment , the nautilus 's temperature , needless to say , stayed at a much higher degree . every maneuver was accomplished with extraordinary precision .",21
"no . a jolt told me that the nautilus had bumped the underbelly of the ice bank , still quite thick to judge from the hollowness of the accompanying noise . indeed , we had "" struck bottom , "" to use nautical terminology , but in the opposite direction and at a depth of 3,000 feet . that gave us 4,000 feet of ice overhead , of which 1,000 feet emerged above water . so the ice bank was higher here than we had found it on the outskirts . a circumstance less than encouraging .",16

"that night my sleep was fitful . hope and fear besieged me by turns . i got up several times . the nautilus continued groping . near three o'clock in the morning , i observed that we encountered the ice bank 's underbelly at a depth of only fifty meters . so only 150 feet separated us from the surface of the water . little by little the ice bank was turning into an ice field again . the mountains were changing back into plains .",40

"my eyes did n't leave the pressure gauge . we kept rising on a diagonal , going along this shiny surface that sparkled beneath our electric rays . above and below , the ice bank was subsiding in long gradients . mile after mile it was growing thinner .",34
"i rushed up onto the platform . yes , open sea ! barely a few sparse floes , some moving icebergs ; a sea stretching into the distance ; hosts of birds in the air and myriads of fish under the waters , which varied from intense blue to olive green depending on the depth . the thermometer marked 3 degrees centigrade . it was as if a comparative springtime had been locked up behind that ice bank , whose distant masses were outlined on the northern horizon .",77
"the thermometer marked -12 degrees centigrade , and a fresh breeze left a sharp nip in the air . ice floes were increasing over the open water . the sea was starting to congeal everywhere . numerous blackish patches were spreading over its surface , announcing the imminent formation of fresh ice . obviously this southernmost basin froze over during its six - month winter and became utterly inaccessible . what happened to the whales during this period ? no doubt they went beneath the ice bank to find more feasible seas . as for seals and walruses , they were accustomed to living in the harshest climates and stayed on in these icy waterways . these animals know by instinct how to gouge holes in the ice fields and keep them continually open ; they go to these holes to breathe . once the birds have migrated northward to escape the cold , these marine mammals remain as sole lords of the polar continent .",86
"meanwhile the ballast tanks filled with water and the nautilus sank slowly . at a depth of 1,000 feet , it stopped . its propeller churned the waves and it headed due north at a speed of fifteen miles per hour . near the afternoon it was already cruising under the immense frozen carapace of the ice bank .",57
"indeed , the nautilus kept the same heel to starboard . no doubt it would straighten up once the block came to a halt . but before that happened , who knew if we might not hit the underbelly of the ice bank and be hideously squeezed between two frozen surfaces ?",42
"the captain went out , and soon i saw that at his orders , the nautilus had halted its upward movement . in fact , it soon would have hit the underbelly of the ice bank , but it had stopped in time and was floating in midwater .",35
"consequently , above , below , and around the nautilus , there were impenetrable frozen walls . we were the ice bank 's prisoners ! the canadian banged a table with his fearsome fist . conseil kept still . i stared at the captain . his face had resumed its usual emotionlessness . he crossed his arms . he pondered . the nautilus did not stir .",21
"at a league from beauvais , where the road was confined between two high banks , they fell in with eight or ten men who , taking advantage of the road being unpaved in this spot , appeared to be employed in digging holes and filling up the ruts with mud .",14
and all rushed down the bank again .,5
"while walking near the wood of monsieur le prince , i laid a few snare in the runs ; and while reclining on the banks of his highness â€™s pieces of water , i slipped a few lines into his fish ponds .",24
""" without taking into account , "" ned answered , "" that once we 're out of this damned prison , we 'll still be cooped up beneath the ice bank , without any possible contact with the open air ! """,30
"the birds , which during the fire had taken refuge on the waters of the lake , had already returned to their accustomed spot , and were dabbling on the banks .",30
"the next day , march 26 , i returned to my miner 's trade , working to remove the fifth meter . the ice bank 's side walls and underbelly had visibly thickened . obviously they would come together before the nautilus could break free . for an instant i was gripped by despair . my pick nearly slipped from my hands . what was the point of this digging if i was to die smothered and crushed by this water turning to stone , a torture undreamed of by even the wildest savages ! i felt like i was lying in the jaws of a fearsome monster , jaws irresistibly closing .",24
but how long would it take to navigate under the ice bank to the open sea ? another day ? i would be dead first !,11
suddenly i regained consciousness . a few whiffs of air had entered my lungs . had we risen to the surface of the waves ? had we cleared the ice bank ?,30
"the end of the bridge which rested on the right bank of the mercy was to be firm , but the other end on the left bank was to be movable , so that it might be raised by means of a counterpoise , as some canal bridges are managed .",26
"on this side the banks were less woody , but clumps of trees , here and there , added to the picturesqueness of the country .",4
"the reporter , herbert , and pencroft in this manner frequently disembarked , sometimes on the right bank , sometimes on the left bank of the mercy .",23
"the poultry - yard occupied an area of two hundred square yards , on the southeastern bank of the lake .",16
"near seven o'clock we finally surveyed the bank of shellfish , where pearl oysters reproduce by the millions . these valuable mollusks stick to rocks , where they 're strongly attached by a mass of brown filaments that forbids their moving about . in this respect oysters are inferior even to mussels , to whom nature has not denied all talent for locomotion .",7
"our visit to this opulent giant clam came to an end . captain nemo left the cave , and we climbed back up the bank of shellfish in the midst of these clear waters not yet disturbed by divers at work .",24
"so i begged ned to let me think about it before taking action . if this measure proved fruitless , it could arouse the captain 's suspicions , make our circumstances even more arduous , and jeopardize the canadian 's plans . i might add that i could hardly use our state of health as an argument . except for that grueling ordeal under the ice bank at the south pole , we had never felt better , neither ned , conseil , nor i. the nutritious food , life - giving air , regular routine , and uniform temperature kept illness at bay ; and for a man who did n't miss his past existence on land , for a captain nemo who was at home here , who went where he wished , who took paths mysterious to others if not himself in attaining his ends , i could understand such a life . but we ourselves had n't severed all ties with humanity . for my part , i did n't want my new and unusual research to be buried with my bones . i had now earned the right to pen the definitive book on the sea , and sooner or later i wanted that book to see the light of day .",66
"but the six survivors , holding their muskets above their heads to preserve them from contact with the water , managed to land on the right bank of the river .",26
"another flash illuminated all around them . grimaud extended his arm , and by the bluish splendor of the fiery serpent they distinguished a little isolated house on the banks of the river , within a hundred paces of a ferry .",29
"at the captain 's signal we returned to the bank of shellfish , and retracing our steps , we walked for half an hour until we encountered the anchor connecting the seafloor with the nautilus 's skiff .",9
"at the point where the sailor had left his raft of wood , it began to run between the two high granite walls ; but if on the left bank the wall remained clear and abrupt , on the right bank , on the contrary , it sank gradually , the massive sides changed to isolated rocks , the rocks to stones , the stones to shingle running to the extremity of the point .",40
"clumps of australian cedars rose on the sloping banks , which were also covered with the high grass called "" tussac "" in new holland ; but the cocoanut , so abundant in the archipelagoes of the pacific , seemed to be wanting in the island , the latitude , doubtless , being too low .",8
"the trees , crowded on the river 's bank , became rare on the upper slopes of the mountain .",8
they advanced more rapidly and easily along the bank of the river than in the forest .,8
"the stream of lava swelled like a river about to overflow its banks , and threatened to demolish the sole obstacle which could prevent it from overrunning the whole far west .",12
"the settlers , wishing to return to the chimneys by the shortest way , descended towards the angle formed on the south by the junction of the lake 's bank .",29
