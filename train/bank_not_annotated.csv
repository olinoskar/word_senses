"at this the whole pack rose up into the air , and came flying down upon her : she gave a little scream , half of fright and half of anger , and tried to beat them off , and found herself lying on the bank , with her head in the lap of her sister , who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face .",45
"so as the fog - bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we were half a mile from the house , and still that dense white sea , with the moon silvering its upper edge , swept slowly and inexorably on .",5
"a sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor . crouching among the stones we stared intently at the silver - tipped bank in front of us . the steps grew louder , and through the fog , as through a curtain , there stepped the man whom we were awaiting . he looked round him in surprise as he emerged into the clear , starlit night . then he came swiftly along the path , passed close to where we lay , and went on up the long slope behind us . as he walked he glanced continually over either shoulder , like a man who is ill at ease .",24

"the thermometer marked -12 degrees centigrade , and a fresh breeze left a sharp nip in the air . ice floes were increasing over the open water . the sea was starting to congeal everywhere . numerous blackish patches were spreading over its surface , announcing the imminent formation of fresh ice . obviously this southernmost basin froze over during its six - month winter and became utterly inaccessible . what happened to the whales during this period ? no doubt they went beneath the ice bank to find more feasible seas . as for seals and walruses , they were accustomed to living in the harshest climates and stayed on in these icy waterways . these animals know by instinct how to gouge holes in the ice fields and keep them continually open ; they go to these holes to breathe . once the birds have migrated northward to escape the cold , these marine mammals remain as sole lords of the polar continent .",86
"meanwhile the ballast tanks filled with water and the nautilus sank slowly . at a depth of 1,000 feet , it stopped . its propeller churned the waves and it headed due north at a speed of fifteen miles per hour . near the afternoon it was already cruising under the immense frozen carapace of the ice bank .",57

"the prairie , across which the sledge was moving in a straight line , was as flat as a sea . it seemed like a vast frozen lake . the railroad which ran through this section ascended from the south - west to the north - west by great island , columbus , an important nebraska town , schuyler , and fremont , to omaha . it followed throughout the right bank of the platte river . the sledge , shortening this route , took a chord of the arc described by the railway . mudge was not afraid of being stopped by the platte river , because it was frozen . the road , then , was quite clear of obstacles , and phileas fogg had but two things to fear -- an accident to the sledge , and a change or calm in the wind .",71

"mr . fogg left the hotel alone , after giving passepartout instructions to await his return , and inform aouda to be ready at an instant 's notice . he proceeded to the banks of the hudson , and looked about among the vessels moored or anchored in the river , for any that were about to depart . several had departure signals , and were preparing to put to sea at morning tide ; for in this immense and admirable port there is not one day in a hundred that vessels do not set out for every quarter of the globe . but they were mostly sailing vessels , of which , of course , phileas fogg could make no use .",33

"for a fare of twenty francs , the vehicle went down broadway to union square , took fourth ave . to its junction with bowery st . , turned into katrin st . and halted at pier 34 . there the katrin ferry transferred men , horses , and carriage to brooklyn , that great new york annex located on the left bank of the east river , and in a few minutes we arrived at the wharf next to which the abraham lincoln was vomiting torrents of black smoke from its two funnels .",62
"it was an insane idea . fortunately i controlled myself and stretched out on the bed to soothe my bodily agitation . my nerves calmed a little , but with my brain so aroused , i did a swift review of my whole existence aboard the nautilus , every pleasant or unpleasant incident that had crossed my path since i went overboard from the abraham lincoln : the underwater hunting trip , the torres strait , our running aground , the savages of papua , the coral cemetery , the suez passageway , the island of santorini , the cretan diver , the bay of vigo , atlantis , the ice bank , the south pole , our imprisonment in the ice , the battle with the devilfish , the storm in the gulf stream , the avenger , and that horrible scene of the vessel sinking with its crew . . . ! all these events passed before my eyes like backdrops unrolling upstage in a theater . in this strange setting captain nemo then grew fantastically . his features were accentuated , taking on superhuman proportions . he was no longer my equal , he was the man of the waters , the spirit of the seas .",111

"the frigate then went along the new jersey coast -- the wonderful right bank of this river , all loaded down with country homes-- and passed by the forts to salutes from their biggest cannons . the abraham lincoln replied by three times lowering and hoisting the american flag , whose thirty - nine stars gleamed from the gaff of the mizzen sail ; then , changing speed to take the buoy - marked channel that curved into the inner bay formed by the spit of sandy hook , it hugged this sand - covered strip of land where thousands of spectators acclaimed us one more time .",13
"as for fix , he said to himself that the bank of england would certainly not come out of this affair well indemnified . when they reached england , even if mr . fogg did not throw some handfuls of bank - bills into the sea , more than seven thousand pounds would have been spent !",40

"on the 13th they passed the edge of the banks of newfoundland , a dangerous locality ; during the winter , especially , there are frequent fogs and heavy gales of wind . ever since the evening before the barometer , suddenly falling , had indicated an approaching change in the atmosphere ; and during the night the temperature varied , the cold became sharper , and the wind veered to the south - east .",9

"consequently , above , below , and around the nautilus , there were impenetrable frozen walls . we were the ice bank 's prisoners ! the canadian banged a table with his fearsome fist . conseil kept still . i stared at the captain . his face had resumed its usual emotionlessness . he crossed his arms . he pondered . the nautilus did not stir .",21
"on the right bank walking would have been difficult , for the declivities fell suddenly , and the trees bending over the water were only sustained by the strength of their roots .",3
"fix took up a position , and carefully examined each face and figure which made its appearance . presently one of the passengers , after vigorously pushing his way through the importunate crowd of porters , came up to him and politely asked if he could point out the english consulate , at the same time showing a passport which he wished to have visaed . fix instinctively took the passport , and with a rapid glance read the description of its bearer . an involuntary motion of surprise nearly escaped him , for the description in the passport was identical with that of the bank robber which he had received from scotland yard .",105
""" here are sixty thousand , "" replied phileas fogg , handing the captain a roll of bank - bills . this had a prodigious effect on andrew speedy . an american can scarcely remain unmoved at the sight of sixty thousand dollars . the captain forgot in an instant his anger , his imprisonment , and all his grudges against his passenger . the henrietta was twenty years old ; it was a great bargain . the bomb would not go off after all . mr . fogg had taken away the match .",17

"the next day , march 26 , i returned to my miner 's trade , working to remove the fifth meter . the ice bank 's side walls and underbelly had visibly thickened . obviously they would come together before the nautilus could break free . for an instant i was gripped by despair . my pick nearly slipped from my hands . what was the point of this digging if i was to die smothered and crushed by this water turning to stone , a torture undreamed of by even the wildest savages ! i felt like i was lying in the jaws of a fearsome monster , jaws irresistibly closing .",24
