""" five hundred paces . """,3
"often these chains of barren rocks made a dip towards the sea , and encroached upon the scanty pasturage : but there was always enough room to pass . besides , our horses instinctively chose the easiest places without ever slackening their pace . my uncle was refused even the satisfaction of stirring up his beast with whip or voice . he had no excuse for being impatient . i could not help smiling to see so tall a man on so small a pony , and as his long legs nearly touched the ground he looked like a six - legged centaur .",42
"we were advancing at a rapid pace . the country was already almost a desert . here and there was a lonely farm , called a boër built either of wood , or of sods , or of pieces of lava , looking like a poor beggar by the wayside . these ruinous huts seemed to solicit charity from passers - by ; and on very small provocation we should have given alms for the relief of the poor inmates . in this country there were no roads and paths , and the poor vegetation , however slow , would soon efface the rare travellers ' footsteps .",6
""" pardon me , sir , "" i went on , "" but that 's merely the freedom that every prisoner has , the freedom to pace his cell ! that 's not enough for us . """,26

"immediately , without any order being given or his place of destination indicated , the coachman set off at a rapid pace , and plunged into the streets of the city .",21
"the torres strait is about thirty - four leagues wide , but it 's obstructed by an incalculable number of islands , islets , breakers , and rocks that make it nearly impossible to navigate . consequently , captain nemo took every desired precaution in crossing it . floating flush with the water , the nautilus moved ahead at a moderate pace . like a cetacean 's tail , its propeller churned the waves slowly .",61
"at eccuis , the same scene was repeated . he found as provident a host and a fresh horse . he left his address as he had done before , and set off again at the same pace for pontoise .",37
"the aperture , which was almost round , was about five feet in diameter ; the dark passage was cut out in the live rock and lined with a coat of the eruptive matter which formerly issued from it ; the interior was level with the ground outside , so that we were able to enter without difficulty . we were following a horizontal plane , when , only six paces in , our progress was interrupted by an enormous block just across our way .",70
""" pace gives life , "" was the riposte .",1
"the drum immediately beat , and the little troop advanced at charging pace .",12
"one of the two riders , he who had spoken second , was ten paces in front of his companion . athos made a sign to porthos and aramis also to remain in the rear , and advanced alone .",14
"he quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which divided us by about half . then , still keeping a hundred yards behind , we followed into oxford street and so down regent street . once our friends stopped and stared into a shop window , upon which holmes did the same . an instant afterwards he gave a little cry of satisfaction , and , following the direction of his eager eyes , i saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which had halted on the other side of the street was now proceeding slowly onward again .",3
"the cart came out , the gate was reclosed , and the onager , led by pencroft , advanced at a slow pace .",22
"at length , after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was beginning to thicken , a carriage appeared , coming at a quick pace on the road of sevres . a presentiment instantly told d’artagnan that this carriage contained the person who had appointed the rendezvous ; the young man was himself astonished to find his heart beat so violently .",27
"at the end of three - quarters of a league , within fifty paces of festubert , a larger bloodstain appeared ; the ground was trampled by horses .",13

"ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the three musketeers to halt . a saddled horse was fastened to the window shutter . the cardinal knocked three times , and in a peculiar manner .",1
""" another use for electricity : that dial hanging before our eyes indicates how fast the nautilus is going . an electric wire puts it in contact with the patent log ; this needle shows me the actual speed of my submersible . and . . . hold on . . . just now we 're proceeding at the moderate pace of fifteen miles per hour .

"hans slept peaceably at the foot of a rock , in a lava bed , where he had found a suitable couch for himself ; but my uncle was pacing around the bottom of the crater like a wild beast in a cage . i had neither the wish nor the strength to rise , and following the guide 's example i went off into an unhappy slumber , fancying i could hear ominous noises or feel tremblings within the recesses of the mountain .",29
"when he was within twenty paces of it , he heard a noise of people and the carriage stopped .",5
"these words redoubled the eagerness of d’artagnan , who urged his horse , though he stood in need of no incitement , and they proceeded at a rapid pace .",28
"but the sailor had not gone fifty paces when he stopped , and again uttering a tremendous hurrah , pointed towards the angle of the cliff,--",7
""" alas , no ! "" said mme . bonacieux ; "" it is a man i do n’t know , although he seems to be coming here . yes , he checks his pace ; he stops at the gate ; he rings . """,34
"both remained suspended , motionless and breathless , within twenty paces of the ground , while the patrol passed beneath them laughing and talking .",10
"but at that moment my attention was drawn to an unexpected sight . at a distance of five hundred paces , at the turn of a high promontory , appeared a high , tufted , dense forest . it was composed of trees of moderate height , formed like umbrellas , with exact geometrical outlines . the currents of wind seemed to have had no effect upon their shape , and in the midst of the windy blasts they stood unmoved and firm , just like a clump of petrified cedars .",19
"the four friends followed , ten paces behind him .",6
"at the end of five hundred paces , more or less , they came to a rivulet , which they forded .",6
"another flash illuminated all around them . grimaud extended his arm , and by the bluish splendor of the fiery serpent they distinguished a little isolated house on the banks of the river , within a hundred paces of a ferry .",37
"but athos continued to march majestically , whatever remarks his companions made ; and they , finding their remarks useless , regulated their pace by his .",23
the exclamation was drawn from athos by seeing the sword of cahusac fly twenty paces from him .,14
"i would not even attempt to understand the whim that induced captain nemo to take us into this gulf . but i wholeheartedly approved of the nautilus 's entering it . it adopted a medium pace , sometimes staying on the surface , sometimes diving to avoid some ship , and so i could observe both the inside and topside of this highly unusual sea .",35
"all three remounted their horses , and set out at a good pace , while porthos was promising his adversary to perforate him with all the thrusts known in the fencing schools .",12

""" it ca n't be a coincidence , "" he cried , at last springing from his chair and pacing wildly up and down the room ; "" it is impossible that it should be a mere coincidence . the very pills which i suspected in the case of drebber are actually found after the death of stangerson . and yet they are inert . what can it mean ? surely my whole chain of reasoning can not have been false . it is impossible ! and yet this wretched dog is none the worse . ah , i have it ! i have it !

"sometimes when the cardinal , always on horseback , like the lowest gendarme of the army , cast a pensive glance over those works , so slowly keeping pace with his wishes , which the engineers , brought from all the corners of france , were executing under his orders , if he met a musketeer of the company of treville , he drew near and looked at him in a peculiar manner , and not recognizing in him one of our four companions , he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in another direction .",28
"at the end of a hundred paces , the ground began to decline , and he could only see the mast of the sloop .",6

"for the next hour our frigate kept up this pace without gaining a fathom ! this was humiliating for one of the fastest racers in the american navy . the crew were working up into a blind rage . sailor after sailor heaved insults at the monster , which could n't be bothered with answering back . commander farragut was no longer content simply to twist his goatee ; he chewed on it .",9
"i had not gone a hundred paces before incontestable proofs presented themselves . it could not be otherwise , for in the silurian age the seas contained at least fifteen hundred vegetable and animal species . my feet , which had become accustomed to the indurated lava floor , suddenly rested upon a dust composed of the _ debris _ of plants and shells . in the walls were distinct impressions of fucoids and lycopodites . professor liedenbrock could not be mistaken , i thought , and yet he pushed on , with , i suppose , his eyes resolutely shut .",6
"at a hundred paces from the gates of calais , d’artagnan ’s horse gave out , and could not by any means be made to get up again , the blood flowing from his eyes and his nose . there still remained planchet ’s horse ; but he stopped short , and could not be made to move a step .",3
"fortunately , as we have said , they were within a hundred paces of the city ; they left their two nags upon the high road , and ran toward the quay .",12
they then moderated their pace so that they should not be out of breath at the moment when a struggle might be necessary .,4
"planchet called his master ’s attention to a gentleman who had just arrived with his lackey , and only preceded them by about fifty paces .",24

"for a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started ; but when out of sight he turned his horse to the right , made a circuit , and came back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of the little troop . having recognized the laced hats of his companions and the golden fringe of the cardinal ’s cloak , he waited till the horsemen had turned the angle of the road , and having lost sight of them , he returned at a gallop to the inn , which was opened to him without hesitation .",3

d’artagnan and planchet followed the gentleman at a distance of five hundred paces .,12

"overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror , unaccountable yet unendurable , i threw on my clothes with haste ( for i felt that i should sleep no more during the night ) , and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which i had fallen , by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment .",50

""" still more ; as soon as monsieur had left and disappeared round the corner of the street , monsieur bonacieux took his hat , shut his door , and set off at a quick pace in an opposite direction . """,35
"while i paced softly on , the last sound i expected to hear in so still a region , a laugh , struck my ear . it was a curious laugh ; distinct , formal , mirthless .",2
"two hundred paces farther they arrived at the cutting , through which , as pencroft had guessed , ran a stream of water , whether fresh or not was to be ascertained .",2
"i continued sketching . these monsters kept pace in our waters with such precision , they seemed to be standing still , and i could have traced their outlines in miniature on the window . but we were moving at a moderate speed .",7
"on the 30th of april , the two sportsmen were in the depth of the far west , when the reporter , preceding herbert a few paces , arrived in a sort of clearing , into which the trees more sparsely scattered had permitted a few rays to penetrate .",26

"they arrived thus , screened by the lining of the trench , till they came within a hundred paces of the bastion .",18
"this homeric slaughter dragged on for an hour , and the long - skulled predators could n't get away . several times ten or twelve of them teamed up , trying to crush the nautilus with their sheer mass . through the windows you could see their enormous mouths paved with teeth , their fearsome eyes . losing all self - control , ned land hurled threats and insults at them . you could feel them clinging to the submersible like hounds atop a wild boar in the underbrush . but by forcing the pace of its propeller , the nautilus carried them off , dragged them under , or brought them back to the upper level of the waters , untroubled by their enormous weight or their powerful grip .",94
at the turning of the counterscarp they found themselves within about sixty paces of the bastion .,12
"planchet took place behind his master , and kept at a distance of ten paces from him .",14
"and so it went , some new wonder constantly delighting us . conseil observed and classified his zoophytes , articulates , mollusks , and fish . the days passed quickly , and i no longer kept track of them . ned , as usual , kept looking for changes of pace from our standard fare . like actual snails , we were at home in our shell , and i can vouch that it 's easy to turn into a full - fledged snail .",50
"they walked at a good pace , a prey to the liveliest emotions .",5
"and rising also , he went off at a quick pace .",10
he quickly saw two heads appear above an abandoned work within thirty paces of him ; they were the heads of the two soldiers .,12
"when they were within ten paces of him , d’artagnan , who in falling had taken care not to let go his sword , sprang up close to them .",5
""" you offer me your services ; with the same frankness i accept them . follow us at a distance of twenty paces , as far as the louvre , and if anyone watches us , slay him ! """,22

"a moment after all four of the party had disappeared in the woods , and the elephant was bearing them away at a rapid pace . but the cries and noise , and a ball which whizzed through phileas fogg 's hat , apprised them that the trick had been discovered .",24

"in fact , bazin , curious to know what the mendicant could want with his master , kept pace with him as well as he could , and arrived almost at the same time he did ; but his quickness was not of much use to him . at the hint from the mendicant his master made him a sign to retire , and he was obliged to obey .",18
"it was a frightful thing to see this wretch , leaving a long track of blood on the ground he passed over , pale with approaching death , trying to drag himself along without being seen to the body of his accomplice , which lay twenty paces from him .",46
"d’artagnan imagined that on arriving in town the duke would slacken his pace , but it was not so . he kept on his way at the same rate , heedless about upsetting those whom he met on the road .",12
"there was another tree and a little thicket beyond it , about fifty yards nearer to them than the place where i was , which , by going a little way about , i saw i might come at undiscovered , and that then i should be within half a shot of them ; so i withheld my passion , though i was indeed enraged to the highest degree ; and going back about twenty paces , i got behind some bushes , which held all the way till i came to the other tree , and then came to a little rising ground , which gave me a full view of them at the distance of about eighty yards .",75
"a few paces away , a monstrous , meter - high sea spider was staring at me with beady eyes , poised to spring at me . although my diving suit was heavy enough to protect me from this animal 's bites , i could n't keep back a shudder of horror . just then conseil woke up , together with the nautilus 's sailor . captain nemo alerted his companion to this hideous crustacean , which a swing of the rifle butt quickly brought down , and i watched the monster 's horrible legs writhing in dreadful convulsions .",2
"i say 150 meters , although i had no instruments for estimating this distance . but i knew that the sun 's rays , even in the clearest seas , could reach no deeper . so at precisely this point the darkness became profound . not a single object was visible past ten paces . consequently , i had begun to grope my way when suddenly i saw the glow of an intense white light . captain nemo had just activated his electric device . his companion did likewise . conseil and i followed suit . by turning a switch , i established contact between the induction coil and the glass spiral , and the sea , lit up by our four lanterns , was illuminated for a radius of twenty - five meters .",53
they had not gone a hundred paces when the ridge by a moderate incline sloped down to the level of the sea .,6
"' yes , but i grow at a reasonable pace , ' said the dormouse : ' not in that ridiculous fashion . ' and he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court .",9
"i was lagging behind some twenty paces when i saw captain nemo suddenly come back toward me . with his powerful hands he sent me buckling to the ground , while his companion did the same to conseil . at first i did n't know what to make of this sudden assault , but i was reassured to observe the captain lying motionless beside me .",6
"and he set off running as if the devil possessed him , hoping that he might yet find the stranger , whose slow pace could not have carried him far .",23
""" we have seen smoke among the rocks , a hundred paces from us . """,11
"aramis pushed his so vigorously that after going back fifty paces , the man ended by fairly taking to his heels , and disappeared amid the hooting of the lackeys .",10
"he sprang into his saddle ; the lackey took his place by the coachman ; the carriage went off at a quick pace , escorted by the three horsemen , and all was over .",22
"the noise became louder ; the horses could not be more than a hundred and fifty paces distant . if they were not yet to be seen , it was because the road made an elbow .",16
"all in all , we enjoyed a highly satisfactory state of health . the diet on board agreed with us perfectly , and for my part , i could easily have gone without those changes of pace that ned land , in a spirit of protest , kept taxing his ingenuity to supply us . what 's more , in this constant temperature we did n't even have to worry about catching colds . besides , the ship had a good stock of the madrepore dendrophylia , known in provence by the name sea fennel , and a poultice made from the dissolved flesh of its polyps will furnish an excellent cough medicine .",36
"from january 21 to the 23rd , the nautilus traveled at the rate of 250 leagues in twenty - four hours , hence 540 miles at twenty - two miles per hour . if , during our trip , we were able to identify these different varieties of fish , it 's because they were attracted by our electric light and tried to follow alongside ; but most of them were outdistanced by our speed and soon fell behind ; temporarily , however , a few managed to keep pace in the nautilus 's waters .",89
"the sulphur spring not being of any actual use to the settlers , they proceeded towards the thick border of the forest , which began some hundred paces off .",27
"inside the mediterranean , then , i could catch no more of its fast - passing scenery than a traveler might see from an express train ; in other words , i could view only the distant horizons because the foregrounds flashed by like lightning . but conseil and i were able to observe those mediterranean fish whose powerful fins kept pace for a while in the nautilus 's waters . we stayed on watch before the lounge windows , and our notes enable me to reconstruct , in a few words , the ichthyology of this sea .",61
