"for nearly ten minutes he stood there , motionless , with parted lips and eyes strangely bright . he was dimly conscious that entirely fresh influences were at work within him . yet they seemed to him to have come really from himself . the few words that basil 's friend had said to him -- words spoken by chance , no doubt , and with wilful paradox in them-- had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before , but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses .",1,"('nearly', 'presque', 'cercar')",1
"the torres strait is about thirty - four leagues wide , but it 's obstructed by an incalculable number of islands , islets , breakers , and rocks that make it nearly impossible to navigate . consequently , captain nemo took every desired precaution in crossing it . floating flush with the water , the nautilus moved ahead at a moderate pace . like a cetacean 's tail , its propeller churned the waves slowly .",31,"('nearly', 'presque', 'casi')",0

"an unbearable heaviness weighed me down . near three o'clock in the afternoon , this agonizing sensation affected me to an intense degree . yawns dislocated my jaws . my lungs were gasping in their quest for that enkindling elastic fluid required for breathing , now growing scarcer and scarcer . my mind was in a daze . i lay outstretched , strength gone , nearly unconscious . my gallant conseil felt the same symptoms , suffered the same sufferings , yet never left my side . he held my hand , he kept encouraging me , and i even heard him mutter :",65,"('nearly', 'presque', 'casi')",0

"i was in some degree settled in my measures for carrying on the plantation before my kind friend , the captain of the ship that took me up at sea , went back — for the ship remained there , in providing his lading and preparing for his voyage , nearly three months — when telling him what little stock i had left behind me in london , he gave me this friendly and sincere advice:—“seignior inglese , ” says he ( for so he always called me ) , “ if you will give me letters , and a procuration in form to me , with orders to the person who has your money in london to send your effects to lisbon , to such persons as i shall direct , and in such goods as are proper for this country , i will bring you the produce of them , god willing , at my return ; but , since human affairs are all subject to changes and disasters , i would have you give orders but for one hundred pounds sterling , which , you say , is half your stock , and let the hazard be run for the first ; so that , if it come safe , you may order the rest the same way , and , if it miscarry , you may have the other half to have recourse to for your supply . ”",50,"('nearly', 'environ', 'cercar')",4

"in the midst of the watery mass , brightly lit by our electric beams , there snaked past those one - meter lampreys that are common to nearly every clime . a type of ray from the genus oxyrhynchus , five feet wide , had a white belly with a spotted , ash - gray back and was carried along by the currents like a huge , wide - open shawl . other rays passed by so quickly i could n't tell if they deserved that name "" eagle ray "" coined by the ancient greeks , or those designations of "" rat ray , "" "" bat ray , "" and "" toad ray "" that modern fishermen have inflicted on them . dogfish known as topes , twelve feet long and especially feared by divers , were racing with each other . looking like big bluish shadows , thresher sharks went by , eight feet long and gifted with an extremely acute sense of smell . dorados from the genus sparus , some measuring up to thirteen decimeters , appeared in silver and azure costumes encircled with ribbons , which contrasted with the dark color of their fins ; fish sacred to the goddess venus , their eyes set in brows of gold ; a valuable species that patronizes all waters fresh or salt , equally at home in rivers , lakes , and oceans , living in every clime , tolerating any temperature , their line dating back to prehistoric times on this earth yet preserving all its beauty from those far - off days . magnificent sturgeons , nine to ten meters long and extremely fast , banged their powerful tails against the glass of our panels , showing bluish backs with small brown spots ; they resemble sharks , without equaling their strength , and are encountered in every sea ; in the spring they delight in swimming up the great rivers , fighting the currents of the volga , danube , po , rhine , loire , and oder , while feeding on herring , mackerel , salmon , and codfish ; although they belong to the class of cartilaginous fish , they rate as a delicacy ; they 're eaten fresh , dried , marinated , or salt - preserved , and in olden times they were borne in triumph to the table of the roman epicure lucullus . but whenever the nautilus drew near the surface , those denizens of the mediterranean i could observe most productively belonged to the sixty - third genus of bony fish . these were tuna from the genus scomber , blue - black on top , silver on the belly armor , their dorsal stripes giving off a golden gleam . they are said to follow ships in search of refreshing shade from the hot tropical sun , and they did just that with the nautilus , as they had once done with the vessels of the count de la pérouse . for long hours they competed in speed with our submersible . i could n't stop marveling at these animals so perfectly cut out for racing , their heads small , their bodies sleek , spindle - shaped , and in some cases over three meters long , their pectoral fins gifted with remarkable strength , their caudal fins forked . like certain flocks of birds , whose speed they equal , these tuna swim in triangle formation , which prompted the ancients to say they 'd boned up on geometry and military strategy . and yet they ca n't escape the provençal fishermen , who prize them as highly as did the ancient inhabitants of turkey and italy ; and these valuable animals , as oblivious as if they were deaf and blind , leap right into the marseilles tuna nets and perish by the thousands .",27,"('nearly', 'presque', 'casi')",0
