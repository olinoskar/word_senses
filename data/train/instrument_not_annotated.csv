""" the common narwhale , or sea unicorn , often reaches a length of sixty feet . increase its dimensions fivefold or even tenfold , then give this cetacean a strength in proportion to its size while enlarging its offensive weapons , and you have the animal we 're looking for . it would have the proportions determined by the officers of the shannon , the instrument needed to perforate the scotia , and the power to pierce a steamer 's hull .",66
""" i understand , captain , i understand your delight at strolling in the midst of this wealth . you 're a man who gathers his treasure in person . no museum in europe owns such a collection of exhibits from the ocean . but if i exhaust all my wonderment on them , i 'll have nothing left for the ship that carries them ! i have absolutely no wish to probe those secrets of yours ! but i confess that my curiosity is aroused to the limit by this nautilus , the motor power it contains , the equipment enabling it to operate , the ultra powerful force that brings it to life . i see some instruments hanging on the walls of this lounge whose purposes are unknown to me . may i learn-- """,119
"as i said , commander farragut had carefully equipped his ship with all the gear needed to fish for a gigantic cetacean . no whaling vessel could have been better armed . we had every known mechanism , from the hand - hurled harpoon , to the blunderbuss firing barbed arrows , to the duck gun with exploding bullets . on the forecastle was mounted the latest model breech - loading cannon , very heavy of barrel and narrow of bore , a weapon that would figure in the universal exhibition of 1867 . made in america , this valuable instrument could fire a four - kilogram conical projectile an average distance of sixteen kilometers without the least bother .",100
"this instrument finished , the engineer returned to the beach , but as it was necessary to take the height of the pole from above a clear horizon , that is , a sea horizon , and as claw cape hid the southern horizon , he was obliged to look for a more suitable station .",1
""" do n't you understand , "" he went on , "" that the congealing of this water could come to our rescue ? do n't you see that by solidifying , it could burst these tracts of ice imprisoning us , just as its freezing can burst the hardest stones ? are n't you aware that this force could be the instrument of our salvation rather than our destruction ?

""" each part of it , professor aronnax , came from a different spot on the globe and reached me at a cover address . its keel was forged by creusot in france , its propeller shaft by pen & co. in london , the sheet - iron plates for its hull by laird 's in liverpool , its propeller by scott 's in glasgow . its tanks were manufactured by cail & co. in paris , its engine by krupp in prussia , its spur by the motala workshops in sweden , its precision instruments by hart bros . in new york , etc . ; and each of these suppliers received my specifications under a different name .

and in truth this instrument would become useless as soon as the weight of the atmosphere should exceed the pressure ascertained at the level of the sea .,4
"the telescope , a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod , stood upon the flat leads of the house . frankland clapped his eye to it and gave a cry of satisfaction .",5
"the captain 's fingers then ran over the instrument 's keyboard , and i noticed that he touched only its black keys , which gave his melodies a basically scottish color . soon he had forgotten my presence and was lost in a reverie that i no longer tried to dispel .",8
"it was by means of the shadow cast on the sand by the stick , a way which , for want of an instrument , would give him a suitable approach to the result which he wished to obtain .",23
"the shore was of course examined with the same care from the edge of the water to the cliff , and nothing could be discovered even with the aid of the instrument .",31
"never had mineralogists found themselves in so marvellous a situation to study nature in situ . what the boring machine , an insensible , inert instrument , was unable to bring to the surface of the inner structure of the globe , we were able to peruse with our own eyes and handle with our own hands .",25
"just then the chief officer drew the captain 's attention anew . the latter interrupted his strolling and aimed his spyglass at the point indicated . he observed it a good while . as for me , deeply puzzled , i went below to the lounge and brought back an excellent long - range telescope i habitually used . leaning my elbows on the beacon housing , which jutted from the stern of the platform , i got set to scour that whole stretch of sky and sea . but no sooner had i peered into the eyepiece than the instrument was snatched from my hands .",100
"near two o'clock i was busy organizing my notes in the lounge , when the captain opened the door and appeared . i bowed to him . he gave me an almost imperceptible bow in return , without saying a word to me . i resumed my work , hoping he might give me some explanation of the previous afternoon 's events . he did nothing of the sort . i stared at him . his face looked exhausted ; his reddened eyes had n't been refreshed by sleep ; his facial features expressed profound sadness , real chagrin . he walked up and down , sat and stood , picked up a book at random , discarded it immediately , consulted his instruments without taking his customary notes , and seemed unable to rest easy for an instant .",123
"i say 150 meters , although i had no instruments for estimating this distance . but i knew that the sun 's rays , even in the clearest seas , could reach no deeper . so at precisely this point the darkness became profound . not a single object was visible past ten paces . consequently , i had begun to grope my way when suddenly i saw the glow of an intense white light . captain nemo had just activated his electric device . his companion did likewise . conseil and i followed suit . by turning a switch , i established contact between the induction coil and the glass spiral , and the sea , lit up by our four lanterns , was illuminated for a radius of twenty - five meters .",9
"it was an instrument of excellent quality , a perfect pocket chronometer , which the reporter had not forgotten to wind up carefully every day .",3
"i speak particularly of the young ladies . st . john 's eyes , though clear enough in a literal sense , in a figurative one were difficult to fathom . he seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people 's thoughts , than as agents to reveal his own : the which combination of keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than to encourage .",38
"there was no denying it . we had all our instruments . as for tools and appliances , there they all lay on the ground -- ladders , ropes , picks , spades , etc .",10
"the instruments of transfer were drawn out : st . john , diana , mary , and i , each became possessed of a competency .",1
