""" my inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait did not lie , and that this fellow was indeed a baskerville . he was a son of that rodger baskerville , the younger brother of sir charles , who fled with a sinister reputation to south america , where he was said to have died unmarried . he did , as a matter of fact , marry , and had one child , this fellow , whose real name is the same as his father 's . he married beryl garcia , one of the beauties of costa rica , and , having purloined a considerable sum of public money , he changed his name to vandeleur and fled to england , where he established a school in the east of yorkshire . his reason for attempting this special line of business was that he had struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon the voyage home , and that he had used this man 's ability to make the undertaking a success . fraser , the tutor , died however , and the school which had begun well sank from disrepute into infamy . the vandeleurs found it convenient to change their name to stapleton , and he brought the remains of his fortune , his schemes for the future , and his taste for entomology to the south of england . i learned at the british museum that he was a recognized authority upon the subject , and that the name of vandeleur has been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had , in his yorkshire days , been the first to describe .",20,"('indeed', 'vraiment', 'efectivamente')",1
