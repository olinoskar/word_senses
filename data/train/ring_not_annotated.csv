"he was not long in making his toilet . he examined himself to see if advantage had been taken of his sleep , and having found his diamond ring on his finger , his purse in his pocket , and his pistols in his belt , he rose , paid for his bottle , and went out to try if he could have any better luck in his search after his lackey than he had had the night before . the first thing he perceived through the damp gray mist was honest planchet , who , with the two horses in hand , awaited him at the door of a little blind cabaret , before which d’artagnan had passed without even a suspicion of its existence .",28
just at this moment the parlour - bell rang .,8
"he was a picard , whom the glorious musketeer had picked up on the bridge tournelle , making rings and plashing in the water .",18
she rang her bell .,1
""" there 's been a woman here , "" he cried . "" it 's a woman 's wedding - ring . "" he held it out , as he spoke , upon the palm of his hand . we all gathered round him and gazed at it . there could be no doubt that that circlet of plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride .",20
""" ' oh , ' returned the fairy , ' that does not signify ! here is a talisman will remove all difficulties ; ' and she held out a pretty gold ring .",32
"the ring , adele , is in my breeches - pocket , under the disguise of a sovereign : but i mean soon to change it to a ring again . """,28
"whereupon i told her not to mind his badinage ; and she , on her part , evinced a fund of genuine french scepticism : denominating mr . rochester "" un vrai menteur , "" and assuring him that she made no account whatever of his "" contes de fee , "" and that "" du reste , il n'y avait pas de fees , et quand meme il y en avait : "" she was sure they would never appear to him , nor ever give him rings , or offer to live with him in the moon .",88
"he conjured the evil spirit with abundance of prayers offered up by the monks . but the devil does not suffer himself to be easily dispossessed from a place in which he has fixed his garrison . in proportion as they redoubled the exorcisms he redoubled the temptations ; so that day and night the bell was ringing full swing , announcing the extreme desire for mortification which the penitent experienced .",57
"while mr . rochester and the other gentlemen directed these alterations , the ladies were running up and down stairs ringing for their maids .",20
"and he returned d’artagnan the ring without , however , ceasing to look at it .",5
"i watched it ascending the drive with indifference ; carriages often came to gateshead , but none ever brought visitors in whom i was interested ; it stopped in front of the house , the door - bell rang loudly , the new - comer was admitted .",38
"from the bosom of his robe he then produced a casket , opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and earrings ; she acted astonishment and admiration ; kneeling , he laid the treasure at her feet ; incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks and gestures ; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the rings in her ears .",58
"he rang , and despatched an invitation to mrs . fairfax , who soon arrived , knitting - basket in hand .",1
"the post - chaise stopped ; the driver rang the door - bell , and a gentleman alighted attired in travelling garb ; but it was not mr . rochester ; it was a tall , fashionable - looking man , a stranger .",8
"with these words mr . brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn in a cover , and having rung for his carriage , he departed .",20
i rang the bell and ordered away the tray .,1
"as he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell . sherlock holmes rose softly and moved his chair in the direction of the door . we heard the servant pass along the hall , and the sharp click of the latch as she opened it .",7
"dorian strolled along by his side . the keen aromatic air , the brown and red lights that glimmered in the wood , the hoarse cries of the beaters ringing out from time to time , and the sharp snaps of the guns that followed , fascinated him and filled him with a sense of delightful freedom . he was dominated by the carelessness of happiness , by the high indifference of joy .",29
""" could you ring him up?--thank you ! and i should be glad to have change of this five - pound note . """,3
"with earliest day , i was up : i had my advertisement written , enclosed , and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school ; it ran thus:--",21
"then the hand was withdrawn , leaving in his an object which he perceived to be a ring .",17

"independently of the sacks of ballast , to which the cords of the net were fastened , the car was held by a strong cable passed through a ring in the pavement .",28

""" well , my theory is that he followed drebber as far as the brixton road . when there , a fresh altercation arose between them , in the course of which drebber received a blow from the stick , in the pit of the stomach , perhaps , which killed him without leaving any mark . the night was so wet that no one was about , so charpentier dragged the body of his victim into the empty house . as to the candle , and the blood , and the writing on the wall , and the ring , they may all be so many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent .

i bethought myself to ring the bell .,4
"now then , this second arm -- more accurately , a collar -- forms a ring of warm water around a section of cool , tranquil , motionless ocean called the sargasso sea . this is an actual lake in the open atlantic , and the great current 's waters take at least three years to circle it .",15

""" my dear fellow , "" said lord henry , elevating his eyebrows in surprise , "" i asked you because i thought you might be able to give me an answer . that is all . i was going through the park last sunday , and close by the marble arch there stood a little crowd of shabby - looking people listening to some vulgar street- preacher . as i passed by , i heard the man yelling out that question to his audience . it struck me as being rather dramatic . london is very rich in curious effects of that kind . a wet sunday , an uncouth christian in a mackintosh , a ring of sickly white faces under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas , and a wonderful phrase flung into the air by shrill hysterical lips -- it was really very good in its way , quite a suggestion . i thought of telling the prophet that art had a soul , but that man had not . i am afraid , however , he would not have understood me . """,117
"at these words he took up a silver bell , and rang it ; the officer entered .",11
"when i again unclosed my eyes , a loud bell was ringing ; the girls were up and dressing ; day had not yet begun to dawn , and a rushlight or two burned in the room .",11
"again the bell rang : all formed in file , two and two , and in that order descended the stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom : here prayers were read by miss miller ; afterwards she called out--",3
she rang the bell and kitty appeared .,1
"there was a cry heard , and a crash . the cry was so horrible in its agony that the frightened servants woke and crept out of their rooms . two gentlemen , who were passing in the square below , stopped and looked up at the great house . they walked on till they met a policeman and brought him back . the man rang the bell several times , but there was no answer . except for a light in one of the top windows , the house was all dark . after a time , he went away and stood in an adjoining portico and watched .",65
"midnight sounded , and almost at the same time the bell was rung in milady ’s chamber .",12
"the whole thing occurred in a moment — so quickly that i had no time to realize it . i have a vivid recollection of that instant , of holmes ' triumphant expression and the ring of his voice , of the cabman 's dazed , savage face , as he glared at the glittering handcuffs , which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists . for a second or two we might have been a group of statues . then , with an inarticulate roar of fury , the prisoner wrenched himself free from holmes 's grasp , and hurled himself through the window . woodwork and glass gave way before him ; but before he got quite through , gregson , lestrade , and holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds . he was dragged back into the room , and then commenced a terrific conflict . so powerful and so fierce was he , that the four of us were shaken off again and again . he appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit . his face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass , but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance . it was not until lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and half - strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail ; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his hands . that done , we rose to our feet breathless and panting .",35
"she said "" good morning , miss , "" in her usual phlegmatic and brief manner ; and taking up another ring and more tape , went on with her sewing .",21
"after a few moments he drew back the latch and slipped out , shutting the door very gently behind him . then he began ringing the bell . in about five minutes his valet appeared , half - dressed and looking very drowsy .",24
"the cardinal being left alone , reflected for an instant and then rang the bell a third time .",12
i laughed incredulously as sherlock holmes leaned back in his settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling .,15
"a group of old fakirs were capering and making a wild ado round the statue ; these were striped with ochre , and covered with cuts whence their blood issued drop by drop -- stupid fanatics , who , in the great indian ceremonies , still throw themselves under the wheels of juggernaut . some brahmins , clad in all the sumptuousness of oriental apparel , and leading a woman who faltered at every step , followed . this woman was young , and as fair as a european . her head and neck , shoulders , ears , arms , hands , and toes were loaded down with jewels and gems with bracelets , earrings , and rings ; while a tunic bordered with gold , and covered with a light muslin robe , betrayed the outline of her form .",118

"a groan broke from campbell 's lips and he shivered all over . the ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece seemed to him to be dividing time into separate atoms of agony , each of which was too terrible to be borne . he felt as if an iron ring was being slowly tightened round his forehead , as if the disgrace with which he was threatened had already come upon him . the hand upon his shoulder weighed like a hand of lead . it was intolerable . it seemed to crush him .",50
"recall the august yet harmonious lineaments , the grecian neck and bust ; let the round and dazzling arm be visible , and the delicate hand ; omit neither diamond ring nor gold bracelet ; portray faithfully the attire , aerial lace and glistening satin , graceful scarf and golden rose ; call it ' blanche , an accomplished lady of rank .

"near four o'clock in the morning , the submersible picked up speed . we could barely cope with this dizzying rush , and the waves battered us at close range . fortunately ned 's hands came across a big mooring ring fastened to the topside of this sheet - iron back , and we all held on for dear life .",40

"after renewing its air , the nautilus stayed at an average depth of fifteen meters , enabling it to return quickly to the surface of the waves . and , contrary to custom , it executed such a maneuver several times during that day of january 19 . the chief officer would then climb onto the platform , and his usual phrase would ring through the ship 's interior .",63
"the prediction of the mormon was only too well fulfilled . whether it was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which she had been forced , poor lucy never held up her head again , but pined away and died within a month . her sottish husband , who had married her principally for the sake of john ferrier 's property , did not affect any great grief at his bereavement ; but his other wives mourned over her , and sat up with her the night before the burial , as is the mormon custom . they were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning , when , to their inexpressible fear and astonishment , the door was flung open , and a savage - looking , weather - beaten man in tattered garments strode into the room . without a glance or a word to the cowering women , he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of lucy ferrier . stooping over her , he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead , and then , snatching up her hand , he took the wedding - ring from her finger . "" she shall not be buried in that , "" he cried with a fierce snarl , and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone . so strange and so brief was the episode , that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it , had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared .",209
"the whole steep slope was covered with gray circular rings of stone , a score of them at least .",9
"we had been gone from the nautilus for about an hour and a half . it was almost noon . i spotted this fact in the perpendicularity of the sun 's rays , which were no longer refracted . the magic of these solar colors disappeared little by little , with emerald and sapphire shades vanishing from our surroundings altogether . we walked with steady steps that rang on the seafloor with astonishing intensity . the tiniest sounds were transmitted with a speed to which the ear is unaccustomed on shore . in fact , water is a better conductor of sound than air , and under the waves noises carry four times as fast .",67
""" that ’s true , "" said athos , and he rang the bell .",11
"at last the mouse , who seemed to be a person of authority among them , called out , ' sit down , all of you , and listen to me ! i 'll soon make you dry enough ! ' they all sat down at once , in a large ring , with the mouse in the middle . alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it , for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon .",51
"our return journey began . captain nemo resumed the lead in our little band , always heading forward without hesitation . i noted that we did n't follow the same path in returning to the nautilus . this new route , very steep and hence very arduous , quickly took us close to the surface of the sea . but this return to the upper strata was n't so sudden that decompression took place too quickly , which could have led to serious organic disorders and given us those internal injuries so fatal to divers . with great promptness , the light reappeared and grew stronger ; and the refraction of the sun , already low on the horizon , again ringed the edges of various objects with the entire color spectrum .",121

"get up ! "" he continued his way toward the quai des grands augustins , while the two friends went to ring at the bell of the unfortunate porthos .",21
"alice thought the whole thing very absurd , but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh ; and , as she could not think of anything to say , she simply bowed , and took the thimble , looking as solemn as she could . the next thing was to eat the comfits : this caused some noise and confusion , as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs , and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back . however , it was over at last , and they sat down again in a ring , and begged the mouse to tell them something more .",107
"meanwhile the grave digging went slowly . fish fled here and there as their retreat was disturbed . i heard the pick ringing on the limestone soil , its iron tip sometimes giving off sparks when it hit a stray piece of flint on the sea bottom . the hole grew longer , wider , and soon was deep enough to receive the body .",22
"it was upon the 4th of march , as i have good reason to remember , that i rose somewhat earlier than usual , and found that sherlock holmes had not yet finished his breakfast . the landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared . with the unreasonable petulance of mankind i rang the bell and gave a curt intimation that i was ready . then i picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it , while my companion munched silently at his toast . one of the articles had a pencil mark at the heading , and i naturally began to run my eye through it .",65
