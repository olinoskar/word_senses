"fix looked intently at his companion , whose countenance was as serene as possible , and laughed with him . but passepartout persisted in chaffing him by asking him if he made much by his present occupation .",8

"phileas fogg gazed at the tempestuous sea , which seemed to be struggling especially to delay him , with his habitual tranquillity . he never changed countenance for an instant , though a delay of twenty hours , by making him too late for the yokohama boat , would almost inevitably cause the loss of the wager . but this man of nerve manifested neither impatience nor annoyance ; it seemed as if the storm were a part of his programme , and had been foreseen . aouda was amazed to find him as calm as he had been from the first time she saw him .",26
"now that she believed herself to be no longer observed , a sentiment resembling ferocity animated her countenance .",17

the countenance of milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other circumstances mme . bonacieux would have fled in terror ; but she was absorbed by jealousy .,1
""" i can not possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding , "" chimed in the dowager ingram .",5
"at this moment hans came , he saw my hand in my uncle 's , and i may safely say that there was joy in his countenance .",26
"d’artagnan approached her with his usual gallantry . she then made an extraordinary effort to receive him , but never did a more distressed countenance give the lie to a more amiable smile .",24
"his countenance reminded one of a lamp quenched , waiting to be re - lit -- and alas ! it was not himself that could now kindle the lustre of animated expression : he was dependent on another for that office !",1
"monseigneur , i was furnished with a description of your horses , your lackeys , your countenances -- nothing was omitted . """,16
"yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable . a cadaverousness of complexion ; an eye large , liquid , and luminous beyond comparison ; lips somewhat thin and very pallid , but of a surpassingly beautiful curve ; a nose of a delicate hebrew model , but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations ; a finely moulded chin , speaking , in its want of prominence , of a want of moral energy ; hair of a more than web - like softness and tenuity;—these features , with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple , made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten .",110
"he looked at me fixedly , compressing his well - cut lips while he did so . whether he was incensed or surprised , or what , it was not easy to tell : he could command his countenance thoroughly .",38

"amid all this , d’artagnan remarked also that not one countenance responded to the gallantries of porthos .",10
"this other musketeer formed a perfect contrast to his interrogator , who had just designated him by the name of aramis . he was a stout man , of about two- or three - and - twenty , with an open , ingenuous countenance , a black , mild eye , and cheeks rosy and downy as an autumn peach . his delicate mustache marked a perfectly straight line upon his upper lip ; he appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their veins should swell , and he pinched the tips of his ears from time to time to preserve their delicate pink transparency .",43
""" and we are going to be recompensed for our diligence ? "" continued the mercer , with a trifling alteration in his voice -- so trifling , indeed , that d’artagnan did not perceive it any more than he had the momentary shade which , an instant before , had darkened the countenance of the worthy man .",53
"miss miller was more ordinary ; ruddy in complexion , though of a careworn countenance ; hurried in gait and action , like one who had always a multiplicity of tasks on hand : she looked , indeed , what i afterwards found she really was , an under - teacher .",14
""" what man is that ? what man is that ? "" cried milady , suffocated by terror , her hair loosening itself , and rising above her livid countenance as if alive .",29
"i was one of the last to go out , and in passing the tables , i saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it ; she looked at the others ; all their countenances expressed displeasure , and one of them , the stout one , whispered--",38
"at that moment , if he did not share our natural emotion , at least his countenance expanded in a manner very unusual with him , and while with the ends of his fingers he lightly pressed our hands , i believe he smiled .",16

"passepartout did not change countenance on hearing this name . he thought that the time had not yet arrived to divulge to his master what had taken place between the detective and himself ; and , in the account he gave of his absence , he simply excused himself for having been overtaken by drunkenness , in smoking opium at a tavern in hong kong .",4
"the countenances of all gave evidence of terror , for notwithstanding the friendly adieu of his eminence , they plainly perceived that the cardinal went away with rage in his heart .",1
"i will not deny that when i called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom i met upon the staircase , on the day of my arrival at the house , i had no desire to oppose what i regarded as at best but a harmless , and by no means an unnatural , precaution .",12

"although the young man was brave , as we know , he was terrified at that wild countenance , those terribly dilated pupils , those pale cheeks , and those bleeding lips . he recoiled to the other side of the room as he would have done from a serpent which was crawling toward him , and his sword coming in contact with his nervous hand , he drew it almost unconsciously from the scabbard .",17
"informed of what had passed by the presence of the cardinal and the alteration in the king ’s countenance , m. de treville felt himself something like samson before the philistines .",18

"at length he raised his head , fixed his eagle look upon that loyal , open , and intelligent countenance , read upon that face , furrowed with tears , all the sufferings its possessor had endured in the course of a month , and reflected for the third or fourth time how much there was in that youth of twenty - one years before him , and what resources his activity , his courage , and his shrewdness might offer to a good master .",19
