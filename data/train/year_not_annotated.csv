"mr . phileas fogg lived , in 1872 , at no . 7 , saville row , burlington gardens , the house in which sheridan died in 1814 . he was one of the most noticeable members of the reform club , though he seemed always to avoid attracting attention ; an enigmatical personage , about whom little was known , except that he was a polished man of the world . people said that he resembled byron -- at least that his head was byronic ; but he was a bearded , tranquil byron , who might live on a thousand years without growing old .",102
"phileas fogg was seated squarely in his armchair , his feet close together like those of a grenadier on parade , his hands resting on his knees , his body straight , his head erect ; he was steadily watching a complicated clock which indicated the hours , the minutes , the seconds , the days , the months , and the years . at exactly half - past eleven mr . fogg would , according to his daily habit , quit saville row , and repair to the reform .",62
