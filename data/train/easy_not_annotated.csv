"often these chains of barren rocks made a dip towards the sea , and encroached upon the scanty pasturage : but there was always enough room to pass . besides , our horses instinctively chose the easiest places without ever slackening their pace . my uncle was refused even the satisfaction of stirring up his beast with whip or voice . he had no excuse for being impatient . i could not help smiling to see so tall a man on so small a pony , and as his long legs nearly touched the ground he looked like a six - legged centaur .",36
