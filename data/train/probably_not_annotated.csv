"in all probability , and such was also herbert 's opinion , some had been left by formidable wild beasts which doubtless would give them some trouble ; but nowhere did they observe the mark of an axe on the trees , nor the ashes of a fire , nor the impression of a human foot . on this they might probably congratulate themselves , for on any land in the middle of the pacific the presence of man was perhaps more to be feared than desired .",61
