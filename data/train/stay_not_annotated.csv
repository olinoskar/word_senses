"captain nemo walked in front , and his companion followed us a few steps to the rear . conseil and i stayed next to each other , as if daydreaming that through our metal carapaces , a little polite conversation might still be possible ! already i no longer felt the bulkiness of my clothes , footwear , and air tank , nor the weight of the heavy sphere inside which my head was rattling like an almond in its shell . once immersed in water , all these objects lost a part of their weight equal to the weight of the liquid they displaced , and thanks to this law of physics discovered by archimedes , i did just fine . i was no longer an inert mass , and i had , comparatively speaking , great freedom of movement .",21
"yes ; who but he ? such an expedient , however simple , would never have entered into our minds . true , it seemed most hazardous to strike a blow of the hammer in this part of the earth 's structure . suppose some displacement should occur and crush us all ! suppose the torrent , bursting through , should drown us in a sudden flood ! there was nothing vain in these fancies . but still no fears of falling rocks or rushing floods could stay us now ; and our thirst was so intense that , to satisfy it , we would have dared the waves of the north atlantic .",87
"then , besides the fat , which would insure for a long time a store of stearine and glycerine , there were still the bones , for which a use could doubtless be found , although there were neither umbrellas nor stays used at granite house .",41
""" fine , ned . stay on the lookout for such an opportunity , but do n't forget , one slipup will finish us . """,5
"i was near two months performing this last work , viz . rigging and fitting my masts and sails ; for i finished them very complete , making a small stay , and a sail , or foresail , to it , to assist if we should turn to windward ; and , what was more than all , i fixed a rudder to the stern of her to steer with . i was but a bungling shipwright , yet as i knew the usefulness and even necessity of such a thing , i applied myself with so much pains to do it , that at last i brought it to pass ; though , considering the many dull contrivances i had for it that failed , i think it cost me almost as much labour as making the boat .",30
"a sergeant told them that they must wait , the commandant could not speak to them ; and that the reverend father provincial did not suffer any spaniard to open his mouth but in his presence , or to stay above three hours in the province .",39
"i told you we shall be married in four weeks . the wedding is to take place quietly , in the church down below yonder ; and then i shall waft you away at once to town . after a brief stay there , i shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun : to french vineyards and italian plains ; and she shall see whatever is famous in old story and in modern record : she shall taste , too , of the life of cities ; and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison with others .

""" now , mind you do n't stay too long over your politics and scandal , "" cried lady narborough from the door . "" if you do , we are sure to squabble upstairs . """,7
"it was just at high - water when these people came on shore ; and while they rambled about to see what kind of a place they were in , they had carelessly stayed till the tide was spent , and the water was ebbed considerably away , leaving their boat aground . they had left two men in the boat , who , as i found afterwards , having drunk a little too much brandy , fell asleep ; however , one of them waking a little sooner than the other and finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it , hallooed out for the rest , who were straggling about : upon which they all soon came to the boat : but it was past all their strength to launch her , the boat being very heavy , and the shore on that side being a soft oozy sand , almost like a quicksand . in this condition , like true seamen , who are , perhaps , the least of all mankind given to forethought , they gave it over , and away they strolled about the country again ; and i heard one of them say aloud to another , calling them off from the boat , “ why , let her alone , jack , ca n’t you ? she ’ll float next tide ; ” by which i was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of what countrymen they were .",33
"the wounded man sank upon his knees , to again kiss the feet of his preserver ; but d’artagnan , who had no longer a motive for staying so near the enemy , abridged the testimonials of his gratitude .",27
"you must go into the drawing- room while it is empty , before the ladies leave the dinner - table ; choose your seat in any quiet nook you like ; you need not stay long after the gentlemen come in , unless you please : just let mr . rochester see you are there and then slip away -- nobody will notice you . """,34
"that 's how we ended this conversation , which later was to have such serious consequences . at first , i must say , events seemed to confirm my forecasts , much to the canadian 's despair . did captain nemo view us with distrust in these heavily traveled seas , or did he simply want to hide from the sight of those ships of every nation that plowed the mediterranean ? i have no idea , but usually he stayed in midwater and well out from any coast . either the nautilus surfaced only enough to let its pilothouse emerge , or it slipped away to the lower depths , although , between the greek islands and asia minor , we did n't find bottom even at 2,000 meters down .",80
"i have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage through france — nothing but what other travellers have given an account of with much more advantage than i can . i travelled from toulouse to paris , and without any considerable stay came to calais , and landed safe at dover the 14th of january , after having had a severe cold season to travel in .",43
"i estimate that this cast of the net brought in more than 1,000 pounds of fish . it was a fine catch but not surprising . in essence , these nets stayed in our wake for several hours , incarcerating an entire aquatic world in prisons made of thread . so we were never lacking in provisions of the highest quality , which the nautilus 's speed and the allure of its electric light could continually replenish .",31
""" i have a good mind to go to london with you , "" said the baronet . "" why should i stay here alone ? """,22
"here i stayed about twenty days , left them supplies of all necessary things , and particularly of arms , powder , shot , clothes , tools , and two workmen , which i had brought from england with me , viz . a carpenter and a smith .",2
"by evening there was still no improvement in our situation . the ice stayed between 400 and 500 meters deep . it was obviously shrinking , but what a barrier still lay between us and the surface of the ocean !",13
"dorian winced and looked round at the grotesque things that lay in such fantastic postures on the ragged mattresses . the twisted limbs , the gaping mouths , the staring lustreless eyes , fascinated him . he knew in what strange heavens they were suffering , and what dull hells were teaching them the secret of some new joy . they were better off than he was . he was prisoned in thought . memory , like a horrible malady , was eating his soul away . from time to time he seemed to see the eyes of basil hallward looking at him . yet he felt he could not stay . the presence of adrian singleton troubled him . he wanted to be where no one would know who he was . he wanted to escape from himself .",110

"there was a long silence after this , and alice could only hear whispers now and then ; such as , ' sure , i do n't like it , yer honour , at all , at all ! ' ' do as i tell you , you coward ! ' and at last she spread out her hand again , and made another snatch in the air . this time there were two little shrieks , and more sounds of broken glass . ' what a number of cucumber - frames there must be ! ' thought alice . ' i wonder what they 'll do next ! as for pulling me out of the window , i only wish they could ! i 'm sure i do n't want to stay in here any longer ! '",132

"the blizzard lasted until the next day . it was impossible to stay on the platform . from the lounge , where i was writing up the incidents of this excursion to the polar continent , i could hear the calls of petrel and albatross cavorting in the midst of the turmoil . the nautilus did n't stay idle , and cruising along the coast , it advanced some ten miles farther south amid the half light left by the sun as it skimmed the edge of the horizon .",12

"inside the mediterranean , then , i could catch no more of its fast - passing scenery than a traveler might see from an express train ; in other words , i could view only the distant horizons because the foregrounds flashed by like lightning . but conseil and i were able to observe those mediterranean fish whose powerful fins kept pace for a while in the nautilus 's waters . we stayed on watch before the lounge windows , and our notes enable me to reconstruct , in a few words , the ichthyology of this sea .",72
"but even so , was the man going to let us die of starvation , locked up in this cramped prison , exposed to those horrible temptations to which people are driven by extreme hunger ? this grim possibility took on a dreadful intensity in my mind , and fired by my imagination , i felt an unreasoning terror run through me . conseil stayed calm . ned land bellowed .",64
