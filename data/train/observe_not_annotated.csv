"i 'm not sure that conseil heeded my recommendation , because he seemed to be deep in thought , no doubt trying to calculate how many one - fifths of a millimeter are found in forty square miles . as for me , i continued to observe this phenomenon . for several hours the nautilus 's spur sliced through these whitish waves , and i watched it glide noiselessly over this soapy water , as if it were cruising through those foaming eddies that a bay 's currents and countercurrents sometimes leave between each other .",46

"most of these seals were sleeping on the rocks or the sand . among those properly termed seals -- which have no external ears , unlike sea lions whose ears protrude -- i observed several varieties of the species stenorhynchus , three meters long , with white hair , bulldog heads , and armed with ten teeth in each jaw : four incisors in both the upper and lower , plus two big canines shaped like the fleur - de - lis . among them slithered some sea elephants , a type of seal with a short , flexible trunk ; these are the giants of the species , with a circumference of twenty feet and a length of ten meters . they did n't move as we approached .",33
"on january 28 , in latitude 9 degrees 4 ' north , when the nautilus returned at noon to the surface of the sea , it lay in sight of land some eight miles to the west . right off , i observed a cluster of mountains about 2,000 feet high , whose shapes were very whimsically sculpted . after our position fix , i reentered the lounge , and when our bearings were reported on the chart , i saw that we were off the island of ceylon , that pearl dangling from the lower lobe of the indian peninsula .",42

"like a covey of snipe over a marsh , there rose underfoot schools of unusual fish from the genus monopterus , whose members have no fin but their tail . i recognized the javanese eel , a genuine eight - decimeter serpent with a bluish gray belly , which , without the gold lines over its flanks , could easily be confused with the conger eel . from the butterfish genus , whose oval bodies are very flat , i observed several adorned in brilliant colors and sporting a dorsal fin like a sickle , edible fish that , when dried and marinated , make an excellent dish known by the name "" karawade "" ; then some sea poachers , fish belonging to the genus aspidophoroides , whose bodies are covered with scaly armor divided into eight lengthwise sections .",80
"in the midst of this moving vegetation , under arbors of water plants , there raced legions of clumsy articulates , in particular some fanged frog crabs whose carapaces form a slightly rounded triangle , robber crabs exclusive to these waterways , and horrible parthenope crabs whose appearance was repulsive to the eye . one animal no less hideous , which i encountered several times , was the enormous crab that mr . darwin observed , to which nature has given the instinct and requisite strength to eat coconuts ; it scrambles up trees on the beach and sends the coconuts tumbling ; they fracture in their fall and are opened by its powerful pincers . here , under these clear waves , this crab raced around with matchless agility , while green turtles from the species frequenting the malabar coast moved sluggishly among the crumbling rocks .",74

"for five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he had already traversed on horseback . at night he flung himself down among the rocks , and snatched a few hours of sleep ; but before daybreak he was always well on his way . on the sixth day , he reached the eagle cañon , from which they had commenced their ill - fated flight . thence he could look down upon the home of the saints . worn and exhausted , he leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him . as he looked at it , he observed that there were flags in some of the principal streets , and other signs of festivity . he was still speculating as to what this might mean when he heard the clatter of horse 's hoofs , and saw a mounted man riding towards him . as he approached , he recognized him as a mormon named cowper , to whom he had rendered services at different times . he therefore accosted him when he got up to him , with the object of finding out what lucy ferrier 's fate had been .",112
