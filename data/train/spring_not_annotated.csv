"and there were provisions too : this was not a large parcel , but it was comforting to know that of essence of beef and biscuits there were six months ' consumption . spirits were the only liquid , and of water we took none ; but we had flasks , and my uncle depended on springs from which to fill them . whatever objections i hazarded as to their quality , temperature , and even absence , remained ineffectual .",56

"in essence , on july 20 , 1866 , the steamer governor higginson , from the calcutta & burnach steam navigation co. , encountered this moving mass five miles off the eastern shores of australia . captain baker at first thought he was in the presence of an unknown reef ; he was even about to fix its exact position when two waterspouts shot out of this inexplicable object and sprang hissing into the air some 150 feet . so , unless this reef was subject to the intermittent eruptions of a geyser , the governor higginson had fair and honest dealings with some aquatic mammal , until then unknown , that could spurt from its blowholes waterspouts mixed with air and steam .",70

"it is true that the old house stood slightly off the perpendicular , and bulged out a little towards the street ; its roof sloped a little to one side , like the cap over the left ear of a tugendbund student ; its lines wanted accuracy ; but after all , it stood firm , thanks to an old elm which buttressed it in front , and which often in spring sent its young sprays through the window panes .",71

"" she shall not be buried in that , "" he cried with a fierce snarl , and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone . so strange and so brief was the episode , that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it , had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared .",238

"we had arranged no plan of campaign , but the baronet is a man to whom the most direct way is always the most natural . he walked into the room , and as he did so barrymore sprang up from the window with a sharp hiss of his breath and stood , livid and trembling , before us . his dark eyes , glaring out of the white mask of his face , were full of horror and astonishment as he gazed from sir henry to me .",38
