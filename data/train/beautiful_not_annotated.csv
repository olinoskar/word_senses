the young woman only replied by the beautiful glow which mounted to her cheeks .,7
""" i hate them for it , "" cried hallward .

it was one of those rare and beautiful days in winter when england remembers that there is a sun .,7
"you came -- oh , my beautiful love!-- and you freed my soul from prison . you taught me what reality really is . to - night , for the first time in my life , i saw through the hollowness , the sham , the silliness of the empty pageant in which i had always played . to- night , for the first time , i became conscious that the romeo was hideous , and old , and painted , that the moonlight in the orchard was false , that the scenery was vulgar , and that the words i had to speak were unreal , were not my words , were not what i wanted to say . you had brought me something higher , something of which all art is but a reflection . you had made me understand what love really is . my love ! my love ! prince charming ! prince of life !",6
she bit her handkerchief with her beautiful teeth .,6

her beautiful face was distorted with agony ; her glassy eyes had no longer their sight ; a convulsive shuddering shook her whole body ; the sweat rolled from her brow .,1
"the officer who had stopped in front of her and studied her with so much care might have been twenty - five or twenty - six years of age . he was of pale complexion , with clear blue eyes , rather deeply set ; his mouth , fine and well cut , remained motionless in its correct lines ; his chin , strongly marked , denoted that strength of will which in the ordinary britannic type denotes mostly nothing but obstinacy ; a brow a little receding , as is proper for poets , enthusiasts , and soldiers , was scarcely shaded by short thin hair which , like the beard which covered the lower part of his face , was of a beautiful deep chestnut color .",124
"but till then the guns had not spoken , and the first report which awoke the echoes of the forest of the far west was provoked by the appearance of a beautiful bird , resembling the kingfisher .",31
"yet it was watching him , with its beautiful marred face and its cruel smile . its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight . its blue eyes met his own . a sense of infinite pity , not for himself , but for the painted image of himself , came over him . it had altered already , and would alter more . its gold would wither into grey . its red and white roses would die . for every sin that he committed , a stain would fleck and wreck its fairness . but he would not sin . the picture , changed or unchanged , would be to him the visible emblem of conscience . he would resist temptation . he would not see lord henry any more -- would not , at any rate , listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in basil hallward 's garden had first stirred within him the passion for impossible things . he would go back to sibyl vane , make her amends , marry her , try to love her again . yes , it was his duty to do so . she must have suffered more than he had . poor child ! he had been selfish and cruel to her . the fascination that she had exercised over him would return . they would be happy together . his life with her would be beautiful and pure .",237
"the train passed rapidly across the state of iowa , by council bluffs , des moines , and iowa city . during the night it crossed the mississippi at davenport , and by rock island entered illinois . the next day , which was the 10th , at four o'clock in the evening , it reached chicago , already risen from its ruins , and more proudly seated than ever on the borders of its beautiful lake michigan .",75
"the officer leaned forward , looked at her in his turn , and appeared surprised to see that face , just before so beautiful , distorted with passion and almost hideous .",23
""" no , you do n't feel it now . some day , when you are old and wrinkled and ugly , when thought has seared your forehead with its lines , and passion branded your lips with its hideous fires , you will feel it , you will feel it terribly . now , wherever you go , you charm the world . will it always be so ? . . . you have a wonderfully beautiful face , mr . gray . do n't frown . you have . and beauty is a form of genius-- is higher , indeed , than genius , as it needs no explanation . it is of the great facts of the world , like sunlight , or spring - time , or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon . it can not be questioned . it has its divine right of sovereignty . it makes princes of those who have it .",77

"such as were only beautiful gave their beauty , whence , without doubt , comes the proverb , "" the most beautiful girl in the world can only give what she has . "" such as were rich gave in addition a part of their money ; and a vast number of heroes of that gallant period may be cited who would neither have won their spurs in the first place , nor their battles afterward , without the purse , more or less furnished , which their mistress fastened to the saddle bow .",4
""" how beautiful ! "" conseil exclaimed .",2
"aside and in special compartments , strings of supremely beautiful pearls were spread out , the electric light flecking them with little fiery sparks : pink pearls pulled from saltwater fan shells in the red sea ; green pearls from the rainbow abalone ; yellow , blue , and black pearls , the unusual handiwork of various mollusks from every ocean and of certain mussels from rivers up north ; in short , several specimens of incalculable worth that had been oozed by the rarest of shellfish . some of these pearls were bigger than a pigeon egg ; they more than equaled the one that the explorer tavernier sold the shah of persia for 3,000,000 francs , and they surpassed that other pearl owned by the imam of muscat , which i had believed to be unrivaled in the entire world .",9
"a fine and white stocking , a silken robe , a lace kerchief , a pretty slipper on the foot , a tasty ribbon on the head do not make an ugly woman pretty , but they make a pretty woman beautiful , without reckoning the hands , which gain by all this ; the hands , among women particularly , to be beautiful must be idle .",41

"dâ€™artagnan , reflecting on his future amours , addressing himself to the beautiful night , and smiling at the stars , ascended the rue cherish - midi , or chase - midi , as it was then called .",12
"and besides , my dear old basil , if you really want to console me , teach me rather to forget what has happened , or to see it from a proper artistic point of view . was it not gautier who used to write about la consolation des arts ? i remember picking up a little vellum - covered book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase . well , i am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at marlow together , the young man who used to say that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life . i love beautiful things that one can touch and handle . old brocades , green bronzes , lacquer - work , carved ivories , exquisite surroundings , luxury , pomp -- there is much to be got from all these . but the artistic temperament that they create , or at any rate reveal , is still more to me .",116
""" oh , you beautiful , good little creature ! "" said milady .",4
"he had been known , in the circle of the musketeers , to win in one night three thousand pistoles ; to lose them even to the gold - embroidered belt for gala days , win all this again with the addition of a hundred louis , without his beautiful eyebrow being heightened or lowered half a line , without his hands losing their pearly hue , without his conversation , which was cheerful that evening , ceasing to be calm and agreeable .",49
"she became excessively pale , leaned her beautiful hand upon a console , which hand appeared then like one of wax , and looking at the king with terror in her eyes , she was unable to reply by a single syllable .",7
"arrived at the spot on which grew the first beautiful trees of the forest , their foliage slightly agitated by the breeze , the stranger appeared greedily to drink in the penetrating odor which filled the atmosphere , and a long sigh escaped from his chest .",9
"on looking around him , however , as he could perceive no threatening object , as nothing indicated that he ran any real danger , as the bench was comfortably covered with a well - stuffed cushion , as the wall was ornamented with a beautiful cordova leather , and as large red damask curtains , fastened back by gold clasps , floated before the window , he perceived by degrees that his fear was exaggerated , and he began to turn his head to the right and the left , upward and downward .",45
"the colonists knew this beautiful wooded coast , since they had already explored it on foot , and yet it again excited their admiration .",4
"it was not such a shore as is usually formed by nature , either by extending a vast carpet of sand , or by grouping masses of rock , but a beautiful border consisting of the most splendid trees .",31

"yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable . a cadaverousness of complexion ; an eye large , liquid , and luminous beyond comparison ; lips somewhat thin and very pallid , but of a surpassingly beautiful curve ; a nose of a delicate hebrew model , but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations ; a finely moulded chin , speaking , in its want of prominence , of a want of moral energy ; hair of a more than web - like softness and tenuity;â€”these features , with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple , made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten .",40
"the sun rising above a clear horizon , announced a magnificent day , one of those beautiful autumn days which are like the last farewells of the warm season .",16
""" i liked bonbons too in those days , miss eyre , and i was _ croquant_--(overlook the barbarism)--_croquant _ chocolate comfits , and smoking alternately , watching meantime the equipages that rolled along the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera - house , when in an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of english horses , and distinctly seen in the brilliant city - night , i recognised the ' voiture ' i had given celine .",53

""" alas ! "" said felton , looking at those beautiful hands , and shaking his head sorrowfully .",10
milady received this look like a resigned victim ; it was impossible to imagine a more submissive or a more mild expression than that which prevailed on her beautiful countenance .,28
"then he turned his attention to embroideries and to the tapestries that performed the office of frescoes in the chill rooms of the northern nations of europe . as he investigated the subject-- and he always had an extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the moment in whatever he took up -- he was almost saddened by the reflection of the ruin that time brought on beautiful and wonderful things . he , at any rate , had escaped that . summer followed summer , and the yellow jonquils bloomed and died many times , and nights of horror repeated the story of their shame , but he was unchanged . no winter marred his face or stained his flowerlike bloom .",67
"so i called conseil to my side , while at an average depth of eight to nine meters , the nautilus slowly skimmed every beautiful rock on the easterly coast .",24
"there was a horrible fascination in them all . he saw them at night , and they troubled his imagination in the day . the renaissance knew of strange manners of poisoning-- poisoning by a helmet and a lighted torch , by an embroidered glove and a jewelled fan , by a gilded pomander and by an amber chain . dorian gray had been poisoned by a book . there were moments when he looked on evil simply as a mode through which he could realize his conception of the beautiful .",90

"once more she found herself in the long hall , and close to the little glass table . ' now , i 'll manage better this time , ' she said to herself , and began by taking the little golden key , and unlocking the door that led into the garden . then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom ( she had kept a piece of it in her pocket ) till she was about a foot high : then she walked down the little passage : and then -- she found herself at last in the beautiful garden , among the bright flower - beds and the cool fountains .",100
""" you forget that beautiful handkerchief with the coat of arms . """,4
"i likewise marveled at the numerous medusas , including the most beautiful of their breed , the compass jellyfish , unique to the falkland seas . some of these jellyfish were shaped like very smooth , semispheric parasols with russet stripes and fringes of twelve neat festoons . others looked like upside - down baskets from which wide leaves and long red twigs were gracefully trailing . they swam with quiverings of their four leaflike arms , letting the opulent tresses of their tentacles dangle in the drift . i wanted to preserve a few specimens of these delicate zoophytes , but they were merely clouds , shadows , illusions , melting and evaporating outside their native element .",11
"he loves ( as he _ can _ love , and that is not as you love ) a beautiful young lady called rosamond . he wanted to marry me only because he thought i should make a suitable missionary 's wife , which she would not have done .",19
"having nothing better to do , i decided to dredge these beautiful , clear waters , which exhibited a profusion of shells , zoophytes , and open - sea plants . besides , it was the last day the nautilus would spend in these waterways , if , tomorrow , it still floated off to the open sea as captain nemo had promised .",11

"like true settlers , the colonists spared the largest and most beautiful trees , which would besides have cost immense labor to fell , and the small ones only were sacrificed , but the result was that the road took a very winding direction , and lengthened itself by numerous detours .",11
"then i took a childish pleasure in exploring the city ; my uncle let me take him with me , but he took notice of nothing , neither the insignificant king 's palace , nor the pretty seventeenth century bridge , which spans the canal before the museum , nor that immense cenotaph of thorwaldsen 's , adorned with horrible mural painting , and containing within it a collection of the sculptor 's works , nor in a fine park the toylike chateau of rosenberg , nor the beautiful renaissance edifice of the exchange , nor its spire composed of the twisted tails of four bronze dragons , nor the great windmill on the ramparts , whose huge arms dilated in the sea breeze like the sails of a ship .",88
