"mr . phileas fogg lived , in 1872 , at no . 7 , saville row , burlington gardens , the house in which sheridan died in 1814 . he was one of the most noticeable members of the reform club , though he seemed always to avoid attracting attention ; an enigmatical personage , about whom little was known , except that he was a polished man of the world . people said that he resembled byron -- at least that his head was byronic ; but he was a bearded , tranquil byron , who might live on a thousand years without growing old .",70
"had he travelled ? it was likely , for no one seemed to know the world more familiarly ; there was no spot so secluded that he did not appear to have an intimate acquaintance with it . he often corrected , with a few clear words , the thousand conjectures advanced by members of the club as to lost and unheard - of travellers , pointing out the true probabilities , and seeming as if gifted with a sort of second sight , so often did events justify his predictions . he must have travelled everywhere , at least in the spirit .",15

"he was so exact that he was never in a hurry , was always ready , and was economical alike of his steps and his motions . he never took one step too many , and always went to his destination by the shortest cut ; he made no superfluous gestures , and was never seen to be moved or agitated . he was the most deliberate person in the world , yet always reached his destination at the exact moment . he lived alone , and , so to speak , outside of every social relation ; and as he knew that in this world account must be taken of friction , and that friction retards , he never rubbed against anybody .",105

"the nautilus kept to its southeasterly heading . on december 1 it cut the equator at longitude 142 degrees , and on the 4th of the same month , after a quick crossing marked by no incident , we raised the marquesas islands . three miles off , in latitude 8 degrees 57 ' south and longitude 139 degrees 32 ' west , i spotted martin point on nuku hiva , chief member of this island group that belongs to france . i could make out only its wooded mountains on the horizon , because captain nemo hated to hug shore . there our nets brought up some fine fish samples : dolphinfish with azure fins , gold tails , and flesh that 's unrivaled in the entire world , wrasse from the genus hologymnosus that were nearly denuded of scales but exquisite in flavor , knifejaws with bony beaks , yellowish albacore that were as tasty as bonito , all fish worth classifying in the ship 's pantry .",128
"the abbess , who was the daughter of a noble house , took particular delight in stories of the court , which so seldom travel to the extremities of the kingdom , and which , above all , have so much difficulty in penetrating the walls of convents , at whose threshold the noise of the world dies away .",56
"i had n't seen captain nemo for over a week , when , on the morning of the 27th , he entered the main lounge , as usual acting as if he 'd been gone for just five minutes . i was busy tracing the nautilus 's course on the world map . the captain approached , placed a finger over a position on the chart , and pronounced just one word :",50
"fix did not have the same thoughts , and could scarcely conceal his agitation . he walked feverishly up and down the platform , but soon resumed his outward composure . he now saw the folly of which he had been guilty in letting fogg go alone . what ! this man , whom he had just followed around the world , was permitted now to separate himself from him ! he began to accuse and abuse himself , and , as if he were director of police , administered to himself a sound lecture for his greenness .",60
"it was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog had lifted . meanwhile we left lestrade in possession of the house while holmes and i went back with the baronet to baskerville hall . the story of the stapletons could no longer be withheld from him , but he took the blow bravely when he learned the truth about the woman whom he had loved . but the shock of the night 's adventures had shattered his nerves , and before morning he lay delirious in a high fever , under the care of dr . mortimer . the two of them were destined to travel together round the world before sir henry had become once more the hale , hearty man that he had been before he became master of that ill - omened estate .",114
"so the nautilus hove before the entrance to the world 's most dangerous strait , a passageway that even the boldest navigators hesitated to clear : the strait that luis vaez de torres faced on returning from the south seas in melanesia , the strait in which sloops of war under captain dumont d'urville ran aground in 1840 and nearly miscarried with all hands . and even the nautilus , rising superior to every danger in the sea , was about to become intimate with its coral reefs .",9
"i estimate -- but perhaps i 'm mistaken -- that the nautilus 's haphazard course continued for fifteen or twenty days , and i 'm not sure how long this would have gone on without the catastrophe that ended our voyage . as for captain nemo , he was no longer in the picture . as for his chief officer , the same applied . not one crewman was visible for a single instant . the nautilus cruised beneath the waters almost continuously . when it rose briefly to the surface to renew our air , the hatches opened and closed as if automated . no more positions were reported on the world map . i did n't know where we were .",112

"gideon spilett ranked among the first of those reporters : a man of great merit , energetic , prompt and ready for anything , full of ideas , having traveled over the whole world , soldier and artist , enthusiastic in council , resolute in action , caring neither for trouble , fatigue , nor danger , when in pursuit of information , for himself first , and then for his journal , a perfect treasury of knowledge on all sorts of curious subjects , of the unpublished , of the unknown , and of the impossible . he was one of those intrepid observers who write under fire , "" reporting "" among bullets , and to whom every danger is welcome .",33
"but perhaps it had been only his fancy that had called vengeance out of the night and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him . actual life was chaos , but there was something terribly logical in the imagination . it was the imagination that set remorse to dog the feet of sin . it was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen brood . in the common world of fact the wicked were not punished , nor the good rewarded . success was given to the strong , failure thrust upon the weak . that was all . besides , had any stranger been prowling round the house , he would have been seen by the servants or the keepers . had any foot - marks been found on the flower - beds , the gardeners would have reported it . yes , it had been merely fancy . sibyl vane 's brother had not come back to kill him . he had sailed away in his ship to founder in some winter sea . from him , at any rate , he was safe . why , the man did not know who he was , could not know who he was . the mask of youth had saved him .",71
"at noon the next day , a man mounted the bridge to ascertain the vessel 's position . it might be thought that this was captain speedy . not the least in the world . it was phileas fogg , esquire . as for captain speedy , he was shut up in his cabin under lock and key , and was uttering loud cries , which signified an anger at once pardonable and excessive .",33
"fix , it must be confessed , understood nothing of what was going on . the conquest of the henrietta , the bribery of the crew , fogg managing the boat like a skilled seaman , amazed and confused him . he did not know what to think . for , after all , a man who began by stealing fifty - five thousand pounds might end by stealing a vessel ; and fix was not unnaturally inclined to conclude that the henrietta under fogg 's command , was not going to liverpool at all , but to some part of the world where the robber , turned into a pirate , would quietly put himself in safety . the conjecture was at least a plausible one , and the detective began to seriously regret that he had embarked on the affair .",102
