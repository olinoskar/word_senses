"there are two currents here : an upper current , long known to exist , that carries the ocean 's waters into the mediterranean basin ; then a lower countercurrent , the only present - day proof of its existence being logic . in essence , the mediterranean receives a continual influx of water not only from the atlantic but from rivers emptying into it ; since local evaporation is n't enough to restore the balance , the total amount of added water should make this sea 's level higher every year . yet this is n't the case , and we 're naturally forced to believe in the existence of some lower current that carries the mediterranean 's surplus through the strait of gibraltar and into the atlantic basin .",13
