"there once more , through the panels opening into these caribbean waters ten meters below the surface of the waves , i found so many fascinating exhibits to describe in my daily notes ! among other zoophytes there were portuguese men - of - war known by the name physalia pelagica , like big , oblong bladders with a pearly sheen , spreading their membranes to the wind , letting their blue tentacles drift like silken threads ; to the eye delightful jellyfish , to the touch actual nettles that ooze a corrosive liquid . among the articulates there were annelid worms one and a half meters long , furnished with a pink proboscis , equipped with 1,700 organs of locomotion , snaking through the waters , and as they went , throwing off every gleam in the solar spectrum . from the fish branch there were manta rays , enormous cartilaginous fish ten feet long and weighing 600 pounds , their pectoral fin triangular , their midback slightly arched , their eyes attached to the edges of the face at the front of the head ; they floated like wreckage from a ship , sometimes fastening onto our windows like opaque shutters . there were american triggerfish for which nature has ground only black and white pigments , feather - shaped gobies that were long and plump with yellow fins and jutting jaws , sixteen - decimeter mackerel with short , sharp teeth , covered with small scales , and related to the albacore species . next came swarms of red mullet corseted in gold stripes from head to tail , their shining fins all aquiver , genuine masterpieces of jewelry , formerly sacred to the goddess diana , much in demand by rich romans , and about which the old saying goes : "" he who catches them does n't eat them ! "" finally , adorned with emerald ribbons and dressed in velvet and silk , golden angelfish passed before our eyes like courtiers in the paintings of veronese ; spurred gilthead stole by with their swift thoracic fins ; thread herring fifteen inches long were wrapped in their phosphorescent glimmers ; gray mullet thrashed the sea with their big fleshy tails ; red salmon seemed to mow the waves with their slicing pectorals ; and silver moonfish , worthy of their name , rose on the horizon of the waters like the whitish reflections of many moons .",257
"the next day the settlers went to collect some , and returned to granite house with an ample supply of cycas stems .",1
the whole of the next day the gallery opened before us its endless arcades . we moved on almost without a word . hans ' silence seemed to be infecting us .,4
""" yes , my gallant ned , "" conseil replied . "" and note well , even when one has grasped all this , one still knows next to nothing , because these families are subdivided into genera , subgenera , species , varieties-- """,27
"the next day , the 17th of april , the sailor 's first words were addressed to gideon spilett .",1
"the next day , november 9 , i woke up only after a long , twelve - hour slumber . conseil , a creature of habit , came to ask "" how master 's night went , "" and to offer his services . he had left his canadian friend sleeping like a man who had never done anything else .",1
next day we started early . we had to hasten forward . it was a three days ' march to the cross roads .,0
"next day , november 10 : the same neglect , the same solitude . i did n't see a soul from the crew . ned and conseil spent the better part of the day with me . they were astonished at the captain 's inexplicable absence . was this eccentric man ill ? did he want to change his plans concerning us ?",0
"this being properly done , they drew the comte de wardes close to his servant ; and as night was approaching , and as the wounded man and the bound man were at some little distance within the wood , it was evident they were likely to remain there till the next day .",51
"felton cast his eyes round for means of escape , and seeing the door free , he rushed into the next chamber , in which , as we have said , the deputies from la rochelle were waiting , crossed it as quickly as possible , and rushed toward the staircase ; but upon the first step he met lord de winter , who , seeing him pale , confused , livid , and stained with blood both on his hands and face , seized him by the throat , crying , "" i knew it ! i guessed it !",20
"when i woke up the next day , november 17 , i sensed that the nautilus was completely motionless . i dressed hurriedly and entered the main lounge .",5
"it was accordingly arranged that ayrton should proceed thither the next day , the 7th of january ; and as he was sufficient for the task , to which he was accustomed , pencroft and the rest were somewhat surprised on hearing the engineer say to ayrton--",10
"whatever might be the sailor 's opinion , the expedition projected by the engineer was settled for the next day .",18
"the next day , at dawn , cyrus harding and ayrton , mounting the cart drawn by two onagers , took the road to the corral and set off at a round trot .",1

"her guests this evening were rather tedious . the fact was , as she explained to dorian , behind a very shabby fan , one of her married daughters had come up quite suddenly to stay with her , and , to make matters worse , had actually brought her husband with her .

"" of course i go and stay with them every summer after i come from homburg , but then an old woman like me must have fresh air sometimes , and besides , i really wake them up . you do n't know what an existence they lead down there . it is pure unadulterated country life . they get up early , because they have so much to do , and go to bed early , because they have so little to think about . there has not been a scandal in the neighbourhood since the time of queen elizabeth , and consequently they all fall asleep after dinner . you sha n't sit next either of them . you shall sit by me and amuse me .

"captain nemo walked in front , and his companion followed us a few steps to the rear . conseil and i stayed next to each other , as if daydreaming that through our metal carapaces , a little polite conversation might still be possible ! already i no longer felt the bulkiness of my clothes , footwear , and air tank , nor the weight of the heavy sphere inside which my head was rattling like an almond in its shell . once immersed in water , all these objects lost a part of their weight equal to the weight of the liquid they displaced , and thanks to this law of physics discovered by archimedes , i did just fine . i was no longer an inert mass , and i had , comparatively speaking , great freedom of movement .",22
the next day was as fine as its predecessor : it was devoted by the party to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood .,1
"the next day , the 8th day of january , after a day and night passed at the corral , where they left all in order , cyrus harding and ayrton arrived at granite house .",1
"by the next day we had forgotten all our sufferings . at first , i was wondering that i was no longer thirsty , and i was for asking for the reason . the answer came in the murmuring of the stream at my feet .",2

"by the next morning , november 18 , i was fully recovered from my exhaustion of the day before , and i climbed onto the platform just as the nautilus 's chief officer was pronouncing his daily phrase . it then occurred to me that these words either referred to the state of the sea , or that they meant : "" there 's nothing in sight .

"the next day , june 1 , the nautilus kept to the same tack . it was obviously trying to locate some precise spot in the ocean . just as on the day before , captain nemo came to take the altitude of the sun . the sea was smooth , the skies clear . eight miles to the east , a big steamship was visible on the horizon line . no flag was flapping from the gaff of its fore - and - aft sail , and i could n't tell its nationality .",1
"i was n't sure what to think , but next to me i heard captain nemo 's voice slowly say :",9
"accordingly , that same evening milady commenced her journey . night overtook her ; she stopped , and slept at an inn . at five o’clock the next morning she again proceeded , and in three hours after entered bethune .",27

"madrepores , which one must guard against confusing with precious coral , clothe their tissue in a limestone crust , and their variations in structure have led my famous mentor professor milne - edwards to classify them into five divisions . the tiny microscopic animals that secrete this polypary live by the billions in the depths of their cells . their limestone deposits build up into rocks , reefs , islets , islands . in some places , they form atolls , a circular ring surrounding a lagoon or small inner lake that gaps place in contact with the sea . elsewhere , they take the shape of barrier reefs , such as those that exist along the coasts of new caledonia and several of the tuamotu islands . in still other localities , such as réunion island and the island of mauritius , they build fringing reefs , high , straight walls next to which the ocean 's depth is considerable .",153

"a week later dorian gray was sitting in the conservatory at selby royal , talking to the pretty duchess of monmouth , who with her husband , a jaded - looking man of sixty , was amongst his guests . it was tea- time , and the mellow light of the huge , lace - covered lamp that stood on the table lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service at which the duchess was presiding . her white hands were moving daintily among the cups , and her full red lips were smiling at something that dorian had whispered to her . lord henry was lying back in a silk - draped wicker chair , looking at them . on a peach - coloured divan sat lady narborough , pretending to listen to the duke 's description of the last brazilian beetle that he had added to his collection . three young men in elaborate smoking - suits were handing tea - cakes to some of the women . the house - party consisted of twelve people , and there were more expected to arrive on the next day .",191
"then , swallowing the contents of his glass , which he put down close to him , athos arose carelessly , took the musket next to him , and drew near to one of the loopholes .",24
"towards two o'clock in the afternoon , while it was snowing hard , long whistles were heard approaching from the east . a great shadow , preceded by a wild light , slowly advanced , appearing still larger through the mist , which gave it a fantastic aspect . no train was expected from the east , neither had there been time for the succour asked for by telegraph to arrive ; the train from omaha to san francisco was not due till the next day . the mystery was soon explained .",84

"the next day about nine o’clock in the morning , he landed at st . valery .",1
"at three o'clock in the morning , full of uneasiness , i climbed onto the platform . captain nemo had n't left it . he stood in the bow next to his flag , which a mild breeze was unfurling above his head . his eyes never left that vessel . the extraordinary intensity of his gaze seemed to attract it , beguile it , and draw it more surely than if he had it in tow !",29
"the next day , the 8th of may , the engineer began his manipulations .",1
"the train passed rapidly across the state of iowa , by council bluffs , des moines , and iowa city . during the night it crossed the mississippi at davenport , and by rock island entered illinois . the next day , which was the 10th , at four o'clock in the evening , it reached chicago , already risen from its ruins , and more proudly seated than ever on the borders of its beautiful lake michigan .",39

"the skiff was put at our disposal for the next morning . i hardly needed to ask whether captain nemo would be coming along . i likewise assumed that no crewmen would be assigned to us , that ned land would be in sole charge of piloting the longboat . besides , the shore lay no more than two miles off , and it would be child 's play for the canadian to guide that nimble skiff through those rows of reefs so ill - fated for big ships .",9
"the next day , january 5 , after its deck paneling was opened , the skiff was wrenched from its socket and launched to sea from the top of the platform . two men were sufficient for this operation . the oars were inside the longboat and we had only to take our seats .",1
"the next day , the 21st of may , at daybreak , the miners went to the point which formed the eastern shore of lake grant , and was only five hundred feet from the coast .",1
"the next day he did not leave the house , and , indeed , spent most of the time in his own room , sick with a wild terror of dying , and yet indifferent to life itself . the consciousness of being hunted , snared , tracked down , had begun to dominate him . if the tapestry did but tremble in the wind , he shook . the dead leaves that were blown against the leaded panes seemed to him like his own wasted resolutions and wild regrets . when he closed his eyes , he saw again the sailor 's face peering through the mist- stained glass , and horror seemed once more to lay its hand upon his heart .",1
"at noon the next day , a man mounted the bridge to ascertain the vessel 's position . it might be thought that this was captain speedy . not the least in the world . it was phileas fogg , esquire . as for captain speedy , he was shut up in his cabin under lock and key , and was uttering loud cries , which signified an anger at once pardonable and excessive .",3

"phileas fogg counted on gaining twelve hours in the same way . instead of arriving at liverpool the next evening by the henrietta , he would be there by noon , and would therefore have time to reach london before a quarter before nine in the evening .",18
"the next day , january 6 : nothing new on board . not a sound inside , not a sign of life . the skiff stayed alongside in the same place we had left it . we decided to return to gueboroa island . ned land hoped for better luck in his hunting than on the day before , and he wanted to visit a different part of the forest .",1

"it happened one time , that going a - fishing in a calm morning , a fog rose so thick that , though we were not half a league from the shore , we lost sight of it ; and rowing we knew not whither or which way , we laboured all day , and all the next night ; and when the morning came we found we had pulled off to sea instead of pulling in for the shore ; and that we were at least two leagues from the shore . however , we got well in again , though with a great deal of labour and some danger ; for the wind began to blow pretty fresh in the morning ; but we were all very hungry .",57

"on this note i was about to withdraw ; but captain nemo detained me and invited me to take a seat next to him . he questioned me with interest on our excursions ashore and on our hunting , but seemed not to understand the canadian 's passionate craving for red meat . then our conversation skimmed various subjects , and without being more forthcoming , captain nemo proved more affable .",21

"alice thought the whole thing very absurd , but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh ; and , as she could not think of anything to say , she simply bowed , and took the thimble , looking as solemn as she could . the next thing was to eat the comfits : this caused some noise and confusion , as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs , and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back . however , it was over at last , and they sat down again in a ring , and begged the mouse to tell them something more .",51
