"a quarter of an hour afterwards , amidst an extraordinary turmoil of applause , sibyl vane stepped on to the stage . yes , she was certainly lovely to look at-- one of the loveliest creatures , lord henry thought , that he had ever seen . there was something of the fawn in her shy grace and startled eyes . a faint blush , like the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver , came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded enthusiastic house . she stepped back a few paces and her lips seemed to tremble . basil hallward leaped to his feet and began to applaud . motionless , and as one in a dream , sat dorian gray , gazing at her . lord henry peered through his glasses , murmuring , "" charming ! charming !

"and at these words , as if all her strength was exhausted , milady sank , weak and languishing , into the arms of the young officer , who , intoxicated with love , anger , and voluptuous sensations hitherto unknown , received her with transport , pressed her against his heart , all trembling at the breath from that charming mouth , bewildered by the contact with that palpitating bosom .",54
"d’artagnan unfolded it with one hand , whose trembling he did not even attempt to conceal , to read :",8
"the lad started and drew back . he was bareheaded , and the leaves had tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads . there was a look of fear in his eyes , such as people have when they are suddenly awakened . his finely chiselled nostrils quivered , and some hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling .",65

"for there would be a real pleasure in watching it . he would be able to follow his mind into its secret places . this portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors . as it had revealed to him his own body , so it would reveal to him his own soul . and when winter came upon it , he would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of summer . when the blood crept from its face , and left behind a pallid mask of chalk with leaden eyes , he would keep the glamour of boyhood . not one blossom of his loveliness would ever fade . not one pulse of his life would ever weaken . like the gods of the greeks , he would be strong , and fleet , and joyous . what did it matter what happened to the coloured image on the canvas ? he would be safe . that was everything .",70

"the next day he did not leave the house , and , indeed , spent most of the time in his own room , sick with a wild terror of dying , and yet indifferent to life itself . the consciousness of being hunted , snared , tracked down , had begun to dominate him . if the tapestry did but tremble in the wind , he shook . the dead leaves that were blown against the leaded panes seemed to him like his own wasted resolutions and wild regrets . when he closed his eyes , he saw again the sailor 's face peering through the mist- stained glass , and horror seemed once more to lay its hand upon his heart .",61

"if my eyes were able to range afar over this great sea , it was because a peculiar light brought to view every detail of it . it was not the light of the sun , with his dazzling shafts of brightness and the splendour of his rays ; nor was it the pale and uncertain shimmer of the moonbeams , the dim reflection of a nobler body of light . no ; the illuminating power of this light , its trembling diffusiveness , its bright , clear whiteness , and its low temperature , showed that it must be of electric origin . it was like an aurora borealis , a continuous cosmical phenomenon , filling a cavern of sufficient extent to contain an ocean .",81

on the landing d’artagnan blushed ; in the antechamber he trembled .,10
"there , to his great astonishment , d’artagnan heard the policy which made all europe tremble criticized aloud and openly , as well as the private life of the cardinal , which so many great nobles had been punished for trying to pry into . that great man who was so revered by d’artagnan the elder served as an object of ridicule to the musketeers of treville , who cracked their jokes upon his bandy legs and his crooked back . some sang ballads about mme . d’aguillon , his mistress , and mme . cambalet , his niece ; while others formed parties and plans to annoy the pages and guards of the cardinal duke -- all things which appeared to d’artagnan monstrous impossibilities .",15
"the warm pressure made d’artagnan tremble , as if by the touch that fever which consumed milady attacked himself .",5

"despite the powerful pressures it was undergoing , the nautilus sank still deeper . i could feel its sheet - iron plates trembling down to their riveted joins ; metal bars arched ; bulkheads groaned ; the lounge windows seemed to be warping inward under the water 's pressure . and this whole sturdy mechanism would surely have given way , if , as its captain had said , it were n't capable of resisting like a solid block .",22

"passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie . up to his arrival at bombay , he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there ; but , now that they were plainly whirling across india at full speed , a sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams . his old vagabond nature returned to him ; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took possession of him . he came to regard his master 's project as intended in good earnest , believed in the reality of the bet , and therefore in the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail within the designated period . already he began to worry about possible delays , and accidents which might happen on the way . he recognised himself as being personally interested in the wager , and trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable folly of the night before . being much less cool - headed than mr . fogg , he was much more restless , counting and recounting the days passed over , uttering maledictions when the train stopped , and accusing it of sluggishness , and mentally blaming mr . fogg for not having bribed the engineer . the worthy fellow was ignorant that , while it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer , it could not be done on the railway .",146

"ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes , jefferson hope had the scanty provisions and water , while lucy had a small bundle containing a few of her more valued possessions . opening the window very slowly and carefully , they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night , and then one by one passed through into the little garden . with bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it , and gained the shelter of the hedge , which they skirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfields . they had just reached this point when the young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the shadow , where they lay silent and trembling .",126

"jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive glance of some stranger . he had that dislike of being stared at , which comes on geniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace . sibyl , however , was quite unconscious of the effect she was producing . her love was trembling in laughter on her lips . she was thinking of prince charming , and , that she might think of him all the more , she did not talk of him , but prattled on about the ship in which jim was going to sail , about the gold he was certain to find , about the wonderful heiress whose life he was to save from the wicked , red - shirted bushrangers . for he was not to remain a sailor , or a supercargo , or whatever he was going to be . oh , no ! a sailor 's existence was dreadful . fancy being cooped up in a horrid ship , with the hoarse , hump - backed waves trying to get in , and a black wind blowing the masts down and tearing the sails into long screaming ribands !",55
"how strange a chequer - work of providence is the life of man ! and by what secret different springs are the affections hurried about , as different circumstances present ! to - day we love what to - morrow we hate ; to - day we seek what to - morrow we shun ; to - day we desire what to - morrow we fear , nay , even tremble at the apprehensions of . this was exemplified in me , at this time , in the most lively manner imaginable ; for i , whose only affliction was that i seemed banished from human society , that i was alone , circumscribed by the boundless ocean , cut off from mankind , and condemned to what i call silent life ; that i was as one whom heaven thought not worthy to be numbered among the living , or to appear among the rest of his creatures ; that to have seen one of my own species would have seemed to me a raising me from death to life , and the greatest blessing that heaven itself , next to the supreme blessing of salvation , could bestow ; i say , that i should now tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a man , and was ready to sink into the ground at but the shadow or silent appearance of a man having set his foot in the island .",208

"our lights produced a thousand delightful effects while playing over these brightly colored boughs . i fancied i saw these cylindrical , membrane - filled tubes trembling beneath the water 's undulations . i was tempted to gather their fresh petals , which were adorned with delicate tentacles , some newly in bloom , others barely opened , while nimble fish with fluttering fins brushed past them like flocks of birds . but if my hands came near the moving flowers of these sensitive , lively creatures , an alarm would instantly sound throughout the colony . the white petals retracted into their red sheaths , the flowers vanished before my eyes , and the bush changed into a chunk of stony nipples .",26
