"the abraham lincoln had been perfectly chosen and fitted out for its new assignment . it was a high - speed frigate furnished with superheating equipment that allowed the tension of its steam to build to seven atmospheres . under this pressure the abraham lincoln reached an average speed of 18.3 miles per hour , a considerable speed but still not enough to cope with our gigantic cetacean .",45

"the wharves of brooklyn , and every part of new york bordering the east river , were crowded with curiosity seekers . departing from 500,000 throats , three cheers burst forth in succession . thousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses , hailing the abraham lincoln until it reached the waters of the hudson river , at the tip of the long peninsula that forms new york city .",51

"in an hour we had reached the islet . two hours later we had completed a full circle around it . it measured four to five miles in circumference . a narrow channel separated it from a considerable shore , perhaps a continent whose limits we could n't see . the existence of this shore seemed to bear out commander maury 's hypotheses . in essence , this ingenious american has noted that between the south pole and the 60th parallel , the sea is covered with floating ice of dimensions much greater than any found in the north atlantic . from this fact he drew the conclusion that the antarctic circle must contain considerable shores , since icebergs ca n't form on the high seas but only along coastlines . according to his calculations , this frozen mass enclosing the southernmost pole forms a vast ice cap whose width must reach 4,000 kilometers .",151
