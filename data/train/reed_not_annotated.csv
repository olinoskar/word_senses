""" but john reed knocked me down , and my aunt shut me up in the red - room . """,3
""" i do n't know . i asked aunt reed once , and she said possibly i might have some poor , low relations called eyre , but she knew nothing about them . """,9
"bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind , or means anything by the words ; but she told miss reed and miss georgiana , and advised them to send for you .",23
""" i can not tell ; aunt reed says if i have any , they must be a beggarly set : i should not like to go a begging . """,7
"sir george lynn was talking of a reed of gateshead yesterday , who , he said , was one of the veriest rascals on town ; and ingram was mentioning a georgiana reed of the same place , who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago in london . """,32
""" what would uncle reed say to you , if he were alive ? "" was my scarcely voluntary demand .",4

"she had a turn for traffic , and a marked propensity for saving ; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens , but also in driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower - roots , seeds , and slips of plants ; that functionary having orders from mrs . reed to buy of his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell : and eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a handsome profit thereby .",53
"the soil was formed of clayey flint - earth , mingled with vegetable matter , such as the remains of rushes , reeds , grass , etc .",22

""" what should i see besides aunt reed in the apartment?--a man or a woman ? """,7
""" deceit is , indeed , a sad fault in a child , "" said mr . brocklehurst ; "" it is akin to falsehood , and all liars will have their portion in the lake burning with fire and brimstone ; she shall , however , be watched , mrs . reed . i will speak to miss temple and the teachers . """,52
""" this is the state of things i quite approve , "" returned mrs . reed ; "" had i sought all england over , i could scarcely have found a system more exactly fitting a child like jane eyre .",15
""" mrs . reed ? ah ! mama , you mean ; she is extremely poorly : i doubt if you can see her to - night . """,3

"my fingers had fastened on her hand which lay outside the sheet : had she pressed mine kindly , i should at that moment have experienced true pleasure . but unimpressionable natures are not so soon softened , nor are natural antipathies so readily eradicated . mrs . reed took her hand away , and , turning her face rather from me , she remarked that the night was warm .",48
""" i am not deceitful : if i were , i should say i loved you ; but i declare i do not love you : i dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except john reed ; and this book about the liar , you may give to your girl , georgiana , for it is she who tells lies , and not i. """,38

""" the miss reeds could not play as well ! "" said she exultingly . "" i always said you would surpass them in learning : and can you draw ? """,3
""" well , that is beautiful , miss jane ! it is as fine a picture as any miss reed 's drawing - master could paint , let alone the young ladies themselves , who could not come near it : and have you learnt french ? """,19

"we had been wandering , indeed , in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning ; but since dinner ( mrs . reed , when there was no company , dined early ) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre , and a rain so penetrating , that further out - door exercise was now out of the question .",23
""" it is well i drew the curtain , "" thought i ; and i wished fervently he might not discover my hiding - place : nor would john reed have found it out himself ; he was not quick either of vision or conception ; but eliza just put her head in at the door , and said at once--",29
"john reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old ; four years older than i , for i was but ten : large and stout for his age , with a dingy and unwholesome skin ; thick lineaments in a spacious visage , heavy limbs and large extremities .",1
"there were moments when i was bewildered by the terror he inspired , because i had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his inflictions ; the servants did not like to offend their young master by taking my part against him , and mrs . reed was blind and deaf on the subject : she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me , though he did both now and then in her very presence , more frequently , however , behind her back .",47
"accustomed to john reed 's abuse , i never had an idea of replying to it ; my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the insult .",3
"aid was near him : eliza and georgiana had run for mrs . reed , who was gone upstairs : she now came upon the scene , followed by bessie and her maid abbot .",13

"miss abbot joined in-- "" and you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the misses reed and master reed , because missis kindly allows you to be brought up with them .",21
"in such vault i had been told did mr . reed lie buried ; and led by this thought to recall his idea , i dwelt on it with gathering dread .",10
"my eyes fail under the dazzling light , my ears are stunned with the incessant crash of thunder . i must be bound to the mast , which bows like a reed before the mighty strength of the storm .",31
