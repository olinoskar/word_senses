"the carriage was ready : they were bringing it round to the front , and my master was pacing the pavement , pilot following him backwards and forwards .",12
"here he is ! "" d’artagnan , walking and soliloquizing , had arrived within a few steps of the hotel d’arguillon and in front of that hotel perceived aramis , chatting gaily with three gentlemen ; but as he had not forgotten that it was in presence of this young man that m. de treville had been so angry in the morning , and as a witness of the rebuke the musketeers had received was not likely to be at all agreeable , he pretended not to see him .",23
""" professor , "" the commander replied swiftly , "" i 'm not what you term a civilized man ! i 've severed all ties with society , for reasons that i alone have the right to appreciate . therefore i obey none of its regulations , and i insist that you never invoke them in front of me ! """,56
"in the northeast there emerged two volcanic islands of unequal size , surrounded by a coral reef whose circuit measured forty miles . we were facing the island of vanikoro proper , to which captain dumont d'urville had given the name "" island of the search "" ; we lay right in front of the little harbor of vana , located in latitude 16 degrees 4 ' south and longitude 164 degrees 32 ' east . its shores seemed covered with greenery from its beaches to its summits inland , crowned by mt . kapogo , which is 476 fathoms high .",52
"there were only two men in the room , sir henry and stapleton . they sat with their profiles towards me on either side of the round table . both of them were smoking cigars , and coffee and wine were in front of them . stapleton was talking with animation , but the baronet looked pale and distrait . perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the ill - omened moor was weighing heavily upon his mind .",42
""" and was that the head and front of his offending ? "" demanded mr . rochester .",7
"a sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor . crouching among the stones we stared intently at the silver - tipped bank in front of us . the steps grew louder , and through the fog , as through a curtain , there stepped the man whom we were awaiting . he looked round him in surprise as he emerged into the clear , starlit night . then he came swiftly along the path , passed close to where we lay , and went on up the long slope behind us . as he walked he glanced continually over either shoulder , like a man who is ill at ease .",26
"a long line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips , and of yellow and red roses , defiled in front of him , threading their way through the huge , jade - green piles of vegetables . under the portico , with its grey , sun - bleached pillars , loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls , waiting for the auction to be over . others crowded round the swinging doors of the coffee - house in the piazza . the heavy cart - horses slipped and stamped upon the rough stones , shaking their bells and trappings . some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks . iris - necked and pink - footed , the pigeons ran about picking up seeds .",20
"the officer who had stopped in front of her and studied her with so much care might have been twenty - five or twenty - six years of age . he was of pale complexion , with clear blue eyes , rather deeply set ; his mouth , fine and well cut , remained motionless in its correct lines ; his chin , strongly marked , denoted that strength of will which in the ordinary britannic type denotes mostly nothing but obstinacy ; a brow a little receding , as is proper for poets , enthusiasts , and soldiers , was scarcely shaded by short thin hair which , like the beard which covered the lower part of his face , was of a beautiful deep chestnut color .",6
"as usual , dinner was served me in my stateroom . full of anxiety , i ate little . i left the table at seven o'clock . 120 minutes-- i was keeping track of them -- still separated me from the moment i was to rejoin ned land . my agitation increased . my pulse was throbbing violently . i could n't stand still . i walked up and down , hoping to calm my troubled mind with movement . the possibility of perishing in our reckless undertaking was the least of my worries ; my heart was pounding at the thought that our plans might be discovered before we had left the nautilus , at the thought of being hauled in front of captain nemo and finding him angered , or worse , saddened by my deserting him .",122
"it was long past noon when he awoke . his valet had crept several times on tiptoe into the room to see if he was stirring , and had wondered what made his young master sleep so late . finally his bell sounded , and victor came in softly with a cup of tea , and a pile of letters , on a small tray of old sevres china , and drew back the olive - satin curtains , with their shimmering blue lining , that hung in front of the three tall windows .",88
"all sad feelings seemed now driven from the house , all gloomy associations forgotten : there was life everywhere , movement all day long . you could not now traverse the gallery , once so hushed , nor enter the front chambers , once so tenantless , without encountering a smart lady's - maid or a dandy valet .",40
"suddenly his eye fell on the screen that he had placed in front of the portrait , and he started .",12
"i watched it ascending the drive with indifference ; carriages often came to gateshead , but none ever brought visitors in whom i was interested ; it stopped in front of the house , the door - bell rang loudly , the new - comer was admitted .",29
"there mr . fogg examined a curious vehicle , a kind of frame on two long beams , a little raised in front like the runners of a sledge , and upon which there was room for five or six persons . a high mast was fixed on the frame , held firmly by metallic lashings , to which was attached a large brigantine sail . this mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist a jib - sail . behind , a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle . it was , in short , a sledge rigged like a sloop . during the winter , when the trains are blocked up by the snow , these sledges make extremely rapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another . provided with more sails than a cutter , and with the wind behind them , they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not superior to that of the express trains .",22
"while pondering this new idea , i heard the front door open ; mr . bates came out , and with him was a nurse .",9
"the latter rose from the front of the window , upon the sill of which he had leaned with his elbow , and knitted his brow like a man disquieted .",5
"taking advantage of this situation , my two companions and i found seats on the ever - deserted platform . in front of us stood the pilothouse , and unless i 'm extremely mistaken , captain nemo must have been inside , steering his nautilus himself .",21
"audley court was not an attractive locality . the narrow passage led us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings . we picked our way among groups of dirty children , and through lines of discoloured linen , until we came to number 46 , the door of which was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name rance was engraved . on enquiry we found that the constable was in bed , and we were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming .",87
"the nurse closed the front door ; i went in by the side entrance which led to the schoolroom : i was just in time ; it was nine o'clock , and miss miller was calling the pupils to go to bed .",4
"the hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends , and athos , advancing a few paces in front of the others , cried in a firm voice , "" who goes there ? """,18
"my uncle raised his spectacles , took up a strong lens , and carefully examined the blank pages of the book . on the front of the second , the title - page , he noticed a sort of stain which looked like an ink blot . but in looking at it very closely he thought he could distinguish some half - effaced letters . my uncle at once fastened upon this as the centre of interest , and he laboured at that blot , until by the help of his microscope he ended by making out the following runic characters which he read without difficulty .",24
"one of the two riders , he who had spoken second , was ten paces in front of his companion . athos made a sign to porthos and aramis also to remain in the rear , and advanced alone .",16
we heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang of the front door . in an instant holmes had changed from the languid dreamer to the man of action .,15
"he drew the screen back into its former place in front of the picture , smiling as he did so , and passed into his bedroom , where his valet was already waiting for him . an hour later he was at the opera , and lord henry was leaning over his chair .",10
"we had been sauntering slowly down regent street during this conversation , and dr . mortimer , with his companion , had long vanished in front of us .",25
"d’artagnan had just passed the rue cassette , and already perceived the door of his friend ’s house , shaded by a mass of sycamores and clematis which formed a vast arch opposite the front of it , when he perceived something like a shadow issuing from the rue servandoni .",34
"suddenly from a lumpy tussock of old grass some twenty yards in front of them , with black - tipped ears erect and long hinder limbs throwing it forward , started a hare . it bolted for a thicket of alders . sir geoffrey put his gun to his shoulder , but there was something in the animal 's grace of movement that strangely charmed dorian gray , and he cried out at once , "" do n't shoot it , geoffrey . let it live . """,12
"the painter stared at him . "" my dear boy , what nonsense ! "" he cried . "" do you mean to say you do n't like what i did of you ? where is it ? why have you pulled the screen in front of it ? let me look at it . it is the best thing i have ever done . do take the screen away , dorian . it is simply disgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that . i felt the room looked different as i came in .

"top and jup , the latter armed with his club , sometimes in front , sometimes beating the wood at the sides of the road , signalized no danger .",13
""" what is ? "" asked lord henry . "" oh ! this accident , i suppose . my dear fellow , it ca n't be helped . it was the man 's own fault . why did he get in front of the guns ? besides , it is nothing to us . it is rather awkward for geoffrey , of course . it does not do to pepper beaters . it makes people think that one is a wild shot . and geoffrey is not ; he shoots very straight . but there is no use talking about the matter . """,41
"i was certainly feeling very weary , so i obeyed his injunction . i left holmes seated in front of the smouldering fire , and long into the watches of the night i heard the low , melancholy wailings of his violin , and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem which he had set himself to unravel .",18
"dorian shook his head . "" you must not ask me that , basil . i could not possibly let you stand in front of that picture . """,23
"there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house , and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it : a dormouse was sitting between them , fast asleep , and the other two were using it as a cushion , resting their elbows on it , and talking over its head . ' very uncomfortable for the dormouse , ' thought alice ; ' only , as it 's asleep , i suppose it does n't mind . '",10
"at half - past ten , to the great surprise of cyrus harding , herbert , who was a little in front , suddenly stopped and exclaimed,--",21
""" i dreamt another dream , sir : that thornfield hall was a dreary ruin , the retreat of bats and owls . i thought that of all the stately front nothing remained but a shell - like wall , very high and very fragile - looking . i wandered , on a moonlight night , through the grass- grown enclosure within : here i stumbled over a marble hearth , and there over a fallen fragment of cornice .",30
"this smile appeared to d’artagnan to be of bad augury . only , as our gascon was not easily intimidated -- or rather , thanks to a great pride natural to the men of his country , he did not allow one easily to see what was passing in his mind when that which was passing at all resembled fear -- he placed himself haughtily in front of messieurs the guards , and waited with his hand on his hip , in an attitude by no means deficient in majesty .",66

"often , on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were his friends , or thought that they were so , he himself would creep upstairs to the locked room , open the door with the key that never left him now , and stand , with a mirror , in front of the portrait that basil hallward had painted of him , looking now at the evil and aging face on the canvas , and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him from the polished glass . the very sharpness of the contrast used to quicken his sense of pleasure . he grew more and more enamoured of his own beauty , more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul . he would examine with minute care , and sometimes with a monstrous and terrible delight , the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth , wondering sometimes which were the more horrible , the signs of sin or the signs of age . he would place his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture , and smile . he mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs .",64
"a long cloak of crimson velvet fell in graceful folds from his shoulders , disclosing in front the splendid baldric , from which was suspended a gigantic rapier .",16
"however , pencroft observed that the shore was more equal , that the ground rose , and he declared that it was joined by a long slope to a hill , whose massive front he thought that he could see looming indistinctly through the mist .",33
"we now slowly ascended a drive , and came upon the long front of a house : candlelight gleamed from one curtained bow - window ; all the rest were dark . the car stopped at the front door ; it was opened by a maid - servant ; i alighted and went in .",12

"as he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and placed it in front of the terrier , who speedily licked it dry . sherlock holmes ' earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in silence , watching the animal intently , and expecting some startling effect . none such appeared , however . the dog continued to lie stretched upon the cushion , breathing in a laboured way , but apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught .",18
"what a hot and strong grasp he had ! and how like quarried marble was his pale , firm , massive front at this moment ! how his eye shone , still watchful , and yet wild beneath !",21
"there once more , through the panels opening into these caribbean waters ten meters below the surface of the waves , i found so many fascinating exhibits to describe in my daily notes ! among other zoophytes there were portuguese men - of - war known by the name physalia pelagica , like big , oblong bladders with a pearly sheen , spreading their membranes to the wind , letting their blue tentacles drift like silken threads ; to the eye delightful jellyfish , to the touch actual nettles that ooze a corrosive liquid . among the articulates there were annelid worms one and a half meters long , furnished with a pink proboscis , equipped with 1,700 organs of locomotion , snaking through the waters , and as they went , throwing off every gleam in the solar spectrum . from the fish branch there were manta rays , enormous cartilaginous fish ten feet long and weighing 600 pounds , their pectoral fin triangular , their midback slightly arched , their eyes attached to the edges of the face at the front of the head ; they floated like wreckage from a ship , sometimes fastening onto our windows like opaque shutters . there were american triggerfish for which nature has ground only black and white pigments , feather - shaped gobies that were long and plump with yellow fins and jutting jaws , sixteen - decimeter mackerel with short , sharp teeth , covered with small scales , and related to the albacore species . next came swarms of red mullet corseted in gold stripes from head to tail , their shining fins all aquiver , genuine masterpieces of jewelry , formerly sacred to the goddess diana , much in demand by rich romans , and about which the old saying goes : "" he who catches them does n't eat them ! "" finally , adorned with emerald ribbons and dressed in velvet and silk , golden angelfish passed before our eyes like courtiers in the paintings of veronese ; spurred gilthead stole by with their swift thoracic fins ; thread herring fifteen inches long were wrapped in their phosphorescent glimmers ; gray mullet thrashed the sea with their big fleshy tails ; red salmon seemed to mow the waves with their slicing pectorals ; and silver moonfish , worthy of their name , rose on the horizon of the waters like the whitish reflections of many moons .",182
""" yes ! fish ! "" conseil exclaimed . "" one would think he was in front of an aquarium ! """,16
"in front of them the lys rolled its waters like a river of molten tin ; while on the other side was a black mass of trees , profiled on a stormy sky , invaded by large coppery clouds which created a sort of twilight amid the night .",1
"a steep curve of heath - clad land , an outlying spur of the moor , lay in front of us . on the summit , hard and clear like an equestrian statue upon its pedestal , was a mounted soldier , dark and stern , his rifle poised ready over his forearm . he was watching the road along which we travelled .",18
"in search of a place proper for this , i found a little plain on the side of a rising hill , whose front towards this little plain was steep as a house - side , so that nothing could come down upon me from the top . on the one side of the rock there was a hollow place , worn a little way in , like the entrance or door of a cave but there was not really any cave or way into the rock at all .",23
""" i have , at least , a well - polished , silver - plated coffee - pot in front of me , "" said he . "" but , tell me , watson , what do you make of our visitor 's stick ? since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion of his errand , this accidental souvenir becomes of importance . let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it .

"he had started running swiftly over the moor , and i had followed at his heels . but now from somewhere among the broken ground immediately in front of us there came one last despairing yell , and then a dull , heavy thud . we halted and listened . not another sound broke the heavy silence of the windless night .",27
"but here , to alice 's great surprise , the duchess 's voice died away , even in the middle of her favourite word ' moral , ' and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble . alice looked up , and there stood the queen in front of them , with her arms folded , frowning like a thunderstorm .",50
"i saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed about him . the light beat upon him where he stood , but long shadows trailed down the walls and hung like a black canopy above him . barrymore had returned from taking our luggage to our rooms . he stood in front of us now with the subdued manner of a well - trained servant . he was a remarkable - looking man , tall , handsome , with a square black beard and pale , distinguished features .",56
"still holding me fast , he left the church : the three gentlemen came after . at the front door of the hall we found the carriage .",18
"after his examination he had no doubt that the ball , entering in front , between the seventh and eighth ribs , had issued behind between the third and fourth .",13
"i drew aside my curtains before i went to bed and looked out from my window . it opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of the hall door . beyond , two copses of trees moaned and swung in a rising wind . a half moon broke through the rifts of racing clouds . in its cold light i saw beyond the trees a broken fringe of rocks , and the long , low curve of the melancholy moor . i closed the curtain , feeling that my last impression was in keeping with the rest .",26
"and then she had such a fine head of hair ; raven - black and so becomingly arranged : a crown of thick plaits behind , and in front the longest , the glossiest curls i ever saw .",28
"i went over to the captain . "" an unusual assortment of devilfish , "" i told him , as carefree as a collector in front of an aquarium .",25
"there was just time to run to the rescue of the baleen whales . the nautilus proceeded to midwater . conseil , ned , and i sat in front of the lounge windows . captain nemo made his way to the helmsman 's side to operate his submersible as an engine of destruction . soon i felt the beats of our propeller getting faster , and we picked up speed .",28
"from a position fronting my own , he had gradually brought round his chair , so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber ; and thus i could but partially perceive his features , although i saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly .",3
"just as we were crowding each other to reach the platform , two more arms lashed the air , swooped on the seaman stationed in front of captain nemo , and carried the fellow away with irresistible violence . captain nemo gave a shout and leaped outside . we rushed after him .",25
""" we must make our start at once , "" said jefferson hope , speaking in a low but resolute voice , like one who realizes the greatness of the peril , but has steeled his heart to meet it .

"captain nemo walked in front , and his companion followed us a few steps to the rear . conseil and i stayed next to each other , as if daydreaming that through our metal carapaces , a little polite conversation might still be possible ! already i no longer felt the bulkiness of my clothes , footwear , and air tank , nor the weight of the heavy sphere inside which my head was rattling like an almond in its shell . once immersed in water , all these objects lost a part of their weight equal to the weight of the liquid they displaced , and thanks to this law of physics discovered by archimedes , i did just fine . i was no longer an inert mass , and i had , comparatively speaking , great freedom of movement .",4
