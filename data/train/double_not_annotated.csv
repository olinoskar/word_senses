"soon the canadian announced that the craft was a big battleship , a double - decker ironclad complete with ram . dark , dense smoke burst from its two funnels . its furled sails merged with the lines of its yardarms . the gaff of its fore - and - aft sail flew no flag . its distance still kept us from distinguishing the colors of its pennant , which was fluttering like a thin ribbon .",13
"there , in place of natural wonders , the watery mass offered some thrilling and dreadful scenes to my eyes . in essence , we were then crossing that part of the whole mediterranean so fertile in casualties . from the coast of algiers to the beaches of provence , how many ships have wrecked , how many vessels have vanished ! compared to the vast liquid plains of the pacific , the mediterranean is a mere lake , but it 's an unpredictable lake with fickle waves , today kindly and affectionate to those frail single - masters drifting between a double ultramarine of sky and water , tomorrow bad - tempered and turbulent , agitated by the winds , demolishing the strongest ships beneath sudden waves that smash down with a headlong wallop .",102

"part of the night passed without incident . we kept watch for an opportunity to take action . we talked little , being too keyed up . ned land was all for jumping overboard . i forced him to wait . as i saw it , the nautilus would attack the double - decker on the surface of the waves , and then it would be not only possible but easy to escape .",51
"i understood this maneuver . it was too late to take action . the nautilus was n't going to strike the double - decker where it was clad in impenetrable iron armor , but below its waterline , where the metal carapace no longer protected its planking .",21
"besides , his intention was formed to make the brave musketeer all suitable apologies , but without meanness or weakness , fearing that might result from this duel which generally results from an affair of this kind , when a young and vigorous man fights with an adversary who is wounded and weakened -- if conquered , he doubles the triumph of his antagonist ; if a conqueror , he is accused of foul play and want of courage .",58
"an enormous mass was sinking beneath the waters , and the nautilus , missing none of its death throes , was descending into the depths with it . ten meters away , i could see its gaping hull , into which water was rushing with a sound of thunder , then its double rows of cannons and railings . its deck was covered with dark , quivering shadows .",52
"the city carpenters had erected scaffolds upon which the invited ladies were to be placed ; the city grocer had ornamented the chambers with two hundred flambeaux of white wax , a piece of luxury unheard of at that period ; and twenty violins were ordered , and the price for them fixed at double the usual rate , upon condition , said the report , that they should be played all night .",54

"alice caught the baby with some difficulty , as it was a queer- shaped little creature , and held out its arms and legs in all directions , ' just like a star - fish , ' thought alice . the poor little thing was snorting like a steam - engine when she caught it , and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again , so that altogether , for the first minute or two , it was as much as she could do to hold it .",58
"what a sight ! how can i describe it ! how can i portray these woods and rocks in this liquid setting , their lower parts dark and sullen , their upper parts tinted red in this light whose intensity was doubled by the reflecting power of the waters ! we scaled rocks that crumbled behind us , collapsing in enormous sections with the hollow rumble of an avalanche . to our right and left there were carved gloomy galleries where the eye lost its way . huge glades opened up , seemingly cleared by the hand of man , and i sometimes wondered whether some residents of these underwater regions would suddenly appear before me .",41
"commander farragut , to my thinking , had made a wise move in hiring on this man . with his eye and his throwing arm , he was worth the whole crew all by himself . i can do no better than to compare him with a powerful telescope that could double as a cannon always ready to fire .",51
"willingly would i now have gone and asked mrs . reed 's pardon ; but i knew , partly from experience and partly from instinct , that was the way to make her repulse me with double scorn , thereby re - exciting every turbulent impulse of my nature .",36

"it would have taken the settlers four hours to do this , on a clear ground and without hurrying themselves ; but as it was they needed double the time , for what with trees to go round , bushes to cut down , and creepers to chop away , they were impeded at every step , these obstacles greatly lengthening their journey .",27

"as there was no want of wood , pencroft proposed to the engineer to give a double lining to the hull , to insure the strength of the vessel .",16
"from this moment on , for nineteen days from february 23 to march 12 , the nautilus stayed in the middle of the atlantic , hustling us along at a constant speed of 100 leagues every twenty - four hours . it was obvious that captain nemo wanted to carry out his underwater program , and i had no doubt that he intended , after doubling cape horn , to return to the pacific south seas .",65
"my mistake . it wanted to retreat , but the unearthly animal came at us with a speed double our own .",18

"the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo : she succeeded in getting its body tucked away , comfortably enough , under her arm , with its legs hanging down , but generally , just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out , and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head , it would twist itself round and look up in her face , with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing : and when she had got its head down , and was going to begin again , it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself , and was in the act of crawling away : besides all this , there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to , and , as the doubled - up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground , alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed .",153

"we were traveling due west and on january 11 we doubled cape wessel , located in longitude 135 degrees and latitude 10 degrees north , the western tip of the gulf of carpentaria . reefs were still numerous but more widely scattered and were fixed on the chart with the greatest accuracy . the nautilus easily avoided the money breakers to port and the victoria reefs to starboard , positioned at longitude 130 degrees on the tenth parallel , which we went along rigorously .",10
"after our position fix , the nautilus 's latitude bearings were modulated to the southwest . our prow pointed to the indian ocean . where would captain nemo 's fancies take us ? would he head up to the shores of asia ? would he pull nearer to the beaches of europe ? unlikely choices for a man who avoided populated areas ! so would he go down south ? would he double the cape of good hope , then cape horn , and push on to the antarctic pole ? finally , would he return to the seas of the pacific , where his nautilus could navigate freely and easily ? time would tell .",72
