toward six o’clock d’artagnan awoke with that uncomfortable feeling which generally accompanies the break of day after a bad night .,8
"the pleasure of riding on horseback over an unknown country made me easy to be pleased at our first start . i threw myself wholly into the pleasure of the trip , and enjoyed the feeling of freedom and satisfied desire . i was beginning to take a real share in the enterprise .",35
""" do n't talk any more of those days , sir , "" i interrupted , furtively dashing away some tears from my eyes ; his language was torture to me ; for i knew what i must do -- and do soon -- and all these reminiscences , and these revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult .",54
""" i disliked mr . brocklehurst ; and i was not alone in the feeling .",14
"in consequence of this feeling of repugnance , he was about to pass without speaking to him , but , as he had done the day before , m. bonacieux accosted him .",4
"i had the pleasure of feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly , and that what i had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home .",5
"mrs . fairfax had said mr . rochester possessed a fine voice : he did -- a mellow , powerful bass , into which he threw his own feeling , his own force ; finding a way through the ear to the heart , and there waking sensation strangely .",28
""" now is my time to make peace with this gallant man , "" said d’artagnan to himself , having stood on one side during the whole of the latter part of the conversation ; and with this good feeling drawing near to aramis , who was departing without paying any attention to him , "" monsieur , "" said he , "" you will excuse me , i hope . """,39
i half believed her ; for i felt indeed only bad feelings surging in my breast .,11
"all sad feelings seemed now driven from the house , all gloomy associations forgotten : there was life everywhere , movement all day long . you could not now traverse the gallery , once so hushed , nor enter the front chambers , once so tenantless , without encountering a smart lady's - maid or a dandy valet .",2
""" he will sacrifice all to his long - framed resolves , "" she said : "" natural affection and feelings more potent still .",20
"i thought diana very provoking , and felt uncomfortably confused ; and while i was thus thinking and feeling , st . john bent his head ; his greek face was brought to a level with mine , his eyes questioned my eyes piercingly -- he kissed me .",18
"october 16th.--a dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain . the house is banked in with rolling clouds , which rise now and then to show the dreary curves of the moor , with thin , silver veins upon the sides of the hills , and the distant boulders gleaming where the light strikes upon their wet faces . it is melancholy outside and in . the baronet is in a black reaction after the excitements of the night . i am conscious myself of a weight at my heart and a feeling of impending danger -- ever present danger , which is the more terrible because i am unable to define it .",94
but i was not jealous : or very rarely;--the nature of the pain i suffered could not be explained by that word . miss ingram was a mark beneath jealousy : she was too inferior to excite the feeling .,38
"i must not forget that these coarsely - clad little peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of gentlest genealogy ; and that the germs of native excellence , refinement , intelligence , kind feeling , are as likely to exist in their hearts as in those of the best - born .",38
""" yes , "" said gideon spilett , "" but his reserve does him honor , and it is right to respect the feeling which he has about his sad past . """,23
"what was he doing just then ? i listened at the door to his stateroom . i heard the sound of footsteps . captain nemo was inside . he had n't gone to bed . with his every movement i imagined he would appear and ask me why i wanted to escape ! i felt in a perpetual state of alarm . my imagination magnified this sensation . the feeling became so acute , i wondered whether it would n't be better to enter the captain 's stateroom , dare him face to face , brave it out with word and deed !",69
"doing nothing , expecting nothing ; merging night in day ; feeling but the sensation of cold when i let the fire go out , of hunger when i forgot to eat : and then a ceaseless sorrow , and , at times , a very delirium of desire to behold my jane again . yes : for her restoration i longed , far more than for that of my lost sight .",11
""" well , how about you , conseil ? what are your feelings about these man - eaters ? """,12
"from the day she left i was no longer the same : with her was gone every settled feeling , every association that had made lowood in some degree a home to me .",18
"the onagers being unharnessed , were thence led to their stable , and pencroft before going to sleep gave vent to his feelings in a deep sigh of satisfaction that awoke all the echoes of granite house .",22
"my father , indeed , imposed the determination , but since his death , i have not a legitimate obstacle to contend with ; some affairs settled , a successor for morton provided , an entanglement or two of the feelings broken through or cut asunder -- a last conflict with human weakness , in which i know i shall overcome , because i have vowed that i _ will _ overcome -- and i leave europe for the east . """,40
"barrymore hesitated for a moment , as if he regretted his outburst , or found it difficult to express his own feelings in words .",21
i would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking ; fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre indignation .,20
"what were pencroft 's feelings , sheltered under a rock on the islet ! what were those of harding , the reporter , herbert , and neb , crouched in the chimneys , when they heard the reports on board the brig !",4
the detective had a feeling akin to humiliation in profiting by the kindness of mr . fogg .,4
"however , my tenderest feelings are about to receive a shock : such is my presentiment ; stay now , to see whether it will be realised . """,4
"fix , as he bowed , had a stifled feeling , and , going forward , where he ensconced himself , did not open his mouth for the rest of the day .",9
"had i attended to the suggestions of pride and ire , i should immediately have left him ; but something worked within me more strongly than those feelings could .",27
""" the flame flickers in the eye ; the eye shines like dew ; it looks soft and full of feeling ; it smiles at my jargon : it is susceptible ; impression follows impression through its clear sphere ; where it ceases to smile , it is sad ; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid : that signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness . it turns from me ; it will not suffer further scrutiny ; it seems to deny , by a mocking glance , the truth of the discoveries i have already made,--to disown the charge both of sensibility and chagrin : its pride and reserve only confirm me in my opinion .",20
"for a minute i stood there with the paper in my hands thinking out the meaning of this curt message . it was i , then , and not sir henry , who was being dogged by this secret man . he had not followed me himself , but he had set an agent -- the boy , perhaps -- upon my track , and this was his report . possibly i had taken no step since i had been upon the moor which had not been observed and reported . always there was this feeling of an unseen force , a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and delicacy , holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme moment that one realized that one was indeed entangled in its meshes .",95
"a twisted flash of pain shot across the painter 's face . he paused for a moment , and a wild feeling of pity came over him . after all , what right had he to pry into the life of dorian gray ? if he had done a tithe of what was rumoured about him , how much he must have suffered ! then he straightened himself up , and walked over to the fire - place , and stood there , looking at the burning logs with their frostlike ashes and their throbbing cores of flame .",21
"when this happened he grumbled vigorously , and , by way of venting his feelings , did the work of six men .",14
"distrust , the very feeling i dreaded , appeared in hannah 's face .",4
"he would not want me to love him ; and if i showed the feeling , he would make me sensible that it was a superfluity , unrequired by him , unbecoming in me . i know he would . """,14
"i remark that professor liedenbrock has a tendency to relapse into an impatient mood , and i make a note of it in my log . all my danger and sufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him ; but now that i am well his nature has resumed its sway . and yet , what cause was there for anger ? is not the voyage prospering as favourably as possible under the circumstances ? is not the raft spinning along with marvellous speed ?",39
"after two hours the guide stopped the elephant , and gave him an hour for rest , during which kiouni , after quenching his thirst at a neighbouring spring , set to devouring the branches and shrubs round about him . neither sir francis nor mr . fogg regretted the delay , and both descended with a feeling of relief . "" why , he 's made of iron ! "" exclaimed the general , gazing admiringly on kiouni .",57
"each picture told a story ; mysterious often to my undeveloped understanding and imperfect feelings , yet ever profoundly interesting : as interesting as the tales bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings , when she chanced to be in good humour ; and when , having brought her ironing - table to the nursery hearth , she allowed us to sit about it , and while she got up mrs . reed 's lace frills , and crimped her nightcap borders , fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads ; or ( as at a later period i discovered ) from the pages of pamela , and henry , earl of moreland .",14
"had grace been young and handsome , i should have been tempted to think that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced mr . rochester in her behalf ; but , hard - favoured and matronly as she was , the idea could not be admitted .",16
"suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it through , and passed at once to my head and extremities .",7
"pencroft was not mistaken , and he gave vent to his feelings in a tremendous hurrah , adding,--",11
"hannah , the servant , was my most frequent visitor . her coming disturbed me . i had a feeling that she wished me away : that she did not understand me or my circumstances ; that she was prejudiced against me .",19
"although i had eaten nothing since the evening before , my fears prevented my feeling hunger .",14
"cyrus harding gazed at the unfortunate man for a few moments with a feeling of deep commiseration ; then,--",13
"with what feelings i welcomed single trees i knew , and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill between them !",2
milady saw at a single glance all the painful feelings she inspired in felton by dwelling on every detail of her recital ; but she would not spare him a single pang .,9
"the next thing i remember is , waking up with a feeling as if i had had a frightful nightmare , and seeing before me a terrible red glare , crossed with thick black bars .",11
"cyrus harding alone waited with his habitual patience , although his strong mind was exasperated at being confronted with such an inexplicable fact , and he was provoked at himself for allowing a feeling to which he could not give a name , to gain an influence over him .",33
""" i _ do _ love you , "" i said , "" more than ever : but i must not show or indulge the feeling : and this is the last time i must express it . """,25
"' perhaps it does n't understand english , ' thought alice ; ' i daresay it 's a french mouse , come over with william the conqueror . ' ( for , with all her knowledge of history , alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened . ) so she began again : ' ou est ma chatte ? ' which was the first sentence in her french lesson - book . the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water , and seemed to quiver all over with fright . ' oh , i beg your pardon ! ' cried alice hastily , afraid that she had hurt the poor animal 's feelings . ' i quite forgot you did n't like cats . '",119
""" it was nearer one than twelve , and a wild , bleak night , blowing hard and raining in torrents . dismal as it was outside , i was glad within — so glad that i could have shouted out from pure exultation . if any of you gentlemen have ever pined for a thing , and longed for it during twenty long years , and then suddenly found it within your reach , you would understand my feelings . i lit a cigar , and puffed at it to steady my nerves , but my hands were trembling , and my temples throbbing with excitement . as i drove , i could see old john ferrier and sweet lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me , just as plain as i see you all in this room . all the way they were ahead of me , one on each side of the horse until i pulled up at the house in the brixton road .",79
""" tell me where i can get you a glass of water , "" said st . john ; "" you must really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings . """,29
"it was with a renewed feeling of disappointment that she waved the tattered lace handkerchief from the window , as her son drove away . she was conscious that a great opportunity had been wasted . she consoled herself by telling sibyl how desolate she felt her life would be , now that she had only one child to look after . she remembered the phrase . it had pleased her . of the threat she said nothing . it was vividly and dramatically expressed . she felt that they would all laugh at it some day .",5
mr . brocklehurst again paused -- perhaps overcome by his feelings .,10
"and i do not want a stranger -- unsympathising , alien , different from me ; i want my kindred : those with whom i have full fellow- feeling .",28
""" complaining does n't have to do good , it just feels good ! and if these pirates -- i say pirates out of consideration for the professor 's feelings , since he does n't want us to call them cannibals-- if these pirates think they 're going to smother me in this cage without hearing what cusswords spice up my outbursts , they 've got another think coming ! look here , professor aronnax , speak frankly . how long do you figure they 'll keep us in this iron box ?

"unfortunately , the qualities of this horse were so well concealed under his strange - colored hide and his unaccountable gait , that at a time when everybody was a connoisseur in horseflesh , the appearance of the aforesaid pony at meung -- which place he had entered about a quarter of an hour before , by the gate of beaugency -- produced an unfavorable feeling , which extended to his rider .",65
herbert shared in some degree the sailor 's feelings .,8
""" harry , "" said basil hallward , looking him straight in the face , "" every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist , not of the sitter . the sitter is merely the accident , the occasion . it is not he who is revealed by the painter ; it is rather the painter who , on the coloured canvas , reveals himself . the reason i will not exhibit this picture is that i am afraid that i have shown in it the secret of my own soul .

"as for our neglect , our isolation in the depths of this cell , i was afraid to guess at how long it might last . little by little , hopes i had entertained after our interview with the ship 's commander were fading away . the gentleness of the man 's gaze , the generosity expressed in his facial features , the nobility of his bearing , all vanished from my memory . i saw this mystifying individual anew for what he inevitably must be : cruel and merciless . i viewed him as outside humanity , beyond all feelings of compassion , the implacable foe of his fellow man , toward whom he must have sworn an undying hate !",100
