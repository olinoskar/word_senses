"he threw himself into a chair and began to think . suddenly there flashed across his mind what he had said in basil hallward 's studio the day the picture had been finished . yes , he remembered it perfectly . he had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain young , and the portrait grow old ; that his own beauty might be untarnished , and the face on the canvas bear the burden of his passions and his sins ; that the painted image might be seared with the lines of suffering and thought , and that he might keep all the delicate bloom and loveliness of his then just conscious boyhood . surely his wish had not been fulfilled ? such things were impossible . it seemed monstrous even to think of them . and , yet , there was the picture before him , with the touch of cruelty in the mouth .",70
"as if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast gloom of the moor that strange cry which i had already heard upon the borders of the great grimpen mire . it came with the wind through the silence of the night , a long , deep mutter , then a rising howl , and then the sad moan in which it died away . again and again it sounded , the whole air throbbing with it , strident , wild , and menacing . the baronet caught my sleeve and his face glimmered white through the darkness .",96
"yet it was watching him , with its beautiful marred face and its cruel smile . its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight . its blue eyes met his own . a sense of infinite pity , not for himself , but for the painted image of himself , came over him . it had altered already , and would alter more . its gold would wither into grey . its red and white roses would die . for every sin that he committed , a stain would fleck and wreck its fairness . but he would not sin . the picture , changed or unchanged , would be to him the visible emblem of conscience . he would resist temptation . he would not see lord henry any more -- would not , at any rate , listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in basil hallward 's garden had first stirred within him the passion for impossible things . he would go back to sibyl vane , make her amends , marry her , try to love her again . yes , it was his duty to do so . she must have suffered more than he had . poor child ! he had been selfish and cruel to her . the fascination that she had exercised over him would return . they would be happy together . his life with her would be beautiful and pure .",10

"then he rose from the table , lit a cigarette , and flung himself down on a luxuriously cushioned couch that stood facing the screen . the screen was an old one , of gilt spanish leather , stamped and wrought with a rather florid louis - quatorze pattern . he scanned it curiously , wondering if ever before it had concealed the secret of a man 's life .",22

"i stood amazed . my uncle had uplifted his long arms to the vault which was our sky ; his mouth gaping wide , his eyes flashing behind his shining spectacles , his head balancing with an up - and - down motion , his whole attitude denoted unlimited astonishment . here he stood facing an immense collection of scattered leptotheria , mericotheria , lophiodia , anoplotheria , megatheria , mastodons , protopithecæ , pterodactyles , and all sorts of extinct monsters here assembled together for his special satisfaction . fancy an enthusiastic bibliomaniac suddenly brought into the midst of the famous alexandrian library burnt by omar and restored by a miracle from its ashes ! just such a crazed enthusiast was my uncle , professor liedenbrock .",54
