"at eleven o'clock the rangoon rode out of singapore harbour , and in a few hours the high mountains of malacca , with their forests , inhabited by the most beautifully - furred tigers in the world , were lost to view . singapore is distant some thirteen hundred miles from the island of hong kong , which is a little english colony near the chinese coast . phileas fogg hoped to accomplish the journey in six days , so as to be in time for the steamer which would leave on the 6th of november for yokohama , the principal japanese port .",45
"on the 28th of march , 1863 , some excavators working under the direction of m. boucher de perthes , in the stone quarries of moulin quignon , near abbeville , in the department of somme , found a human jawbone fourteen feet beneath the surface . it was the first fossil of this nature that had ever been brought to light . not far distant were found stone hatchets and flint arrow - heads stained and encased by lapse of time with a uniform coat of rust .",65
""" i am very ignorant of these matters , "" said the abbess , at length ; "" but however distant from the court we may be , however remote from the interests of the world we may be placed , we have very sad examples of what you have related . and one of our boarders has suffered much from the vengeance and persecution of the cardinal !

"on leaving rejkiavik hans took us by the seashore . we passed lean pastures which were trying very hard , but in vain , to look green ; yellow came out best . the rugged peaks of the trachyte rocks presented faint outlines on the eastern horizon ; at times a few patches of snow , concentrating the vague light , glittered upon the slopes of the distant mountains ; certain peaks , boldly uprising , passed through the grey clouds , and reappeared above the moving mists , like breakers emerging in the heavens .",67
"we had long lost sight of the sea shore behind the hills of bones . the rash professor , careless of losing his way , hurried me forward . we advanced in silence , bathed in luminous electric fluid . by some phenomenon which i am unable to explain , it lighted up all sides of every object equally . such was its diffusiveness , there being no central point from which the light emanated , that shadows no longer existed . you might have thought yourself under the rays of a vertical sun in a tropical region at noonday and the height of summer . no vapour was visible . the rocks , the distant mountains , a few isolated clumps of forest trees in the distance , presented a weird and wonderful aspect under these totally new conditions of a universal diffusion of light . we were like hoffmann 's shadowless man .",115
"they kept a sharp look - out , for either lincoln island could not be far distant and would be sighted at daybreak , or the "" bonadventure , "" carried away by currents , had drifted so much that it would be impossible to rectify her course .",16
""" the deepest parts of the ocean are totally unknown to us . no soundings have been able to reach them . what goes on in those distant depths ? what creatures inhabit , or could inhabit , those regions twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the water ? what is the constitution of these animals ? it 's almost beyond conjecture .",27

"' what can all that green stuff be ? ' said alice . ' and where have my shoulders got to ? and oh , my poor hands , how is it i ca n't see you ? ' she was moving them about as she spoke , but no result seemed to follow , except a little shaking among the distant green leaves .",61
"october 16th.--a dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain . the house is banked in with rolling clouds , which rise now and then to show the dreary curves of the moor , with thin , silver veins upon the sides of the hills , and the distant boulders gleaming where the light strikes upon their wet faces . it is melancholy outside and in . the baronet is in a black reaction after the excitements of the night . i am conscious myself of a weight at my heart and a feeling of impending danger -- ever present danger , which is the more terrible because i am unable to define it .",49
"it gazed and gazed on me . it spoke to my spirit : immeasurably distant was the tone , yet so near , it whispered in my heart--",14
"all around had disappeared in the abyss ; the inferior cone of mount franklin , rent asunder by the explosion ; the lava jaws of shark gulf , the plateau of prospect heights , safety islet , the granite rocks of port balloon , the basalts of dakkar grotto , the long serpentine peninsula , so distant nevertheless from the center of the eruption .",56

i knew mr . rochester had been a traveller : mrs . fairfax had said so ; but i thought the continent of europe had bounded his wanderings ; till now i had never heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores .,42
"to judge by the distant appearance of the summit of snæfell , it would have seemed too steep to ascend on our side . fortunately , after an hour of fatigue and athletic exercises , in the midst of the vast surface of snow presented by the hollow between the two peaks , a kind of staircase appeared unexpectedly which greatly facilitated our ascent . it was formed by one of those torrents of stones flung up by the eruptions , called ' sting ' by the icelanders . if this torrent had not been arrested in its fall by the formation of the sides of the mountain , it would have gone on to the sea and formed more islands .",4
"another long fiber , previously impregnated with sulphur , was attached to the middle of the first , by one end , while the other lay on the ground several feet distant from the mine .",31
"those piles of stones just mentioned were laid out on the ocean floor with a distinct but inexplicable symmetry . i spotted gigantic furrows trailing off into the distant darkness , their length incalculable . there also were other peculiarities i could n't make sense of . it seemed to me that my heavy lead soles were crushing a litter of bones that made a dry crackling noise . so what were these vast plains we were now crossing ? i wanted to ask the captain , but i still did n't grasp that sign language that allowed him to chat with his companions when they went with him on his underwater excursions .",28
"my uncle pointed out to me in the far west a light steam or mist , a semblance of land , which bounded the distant horizon of waters .",24
"in fact , four men such as they were -- four men devoted to one another , from their purses to their lives ; four men always supporting one another , never yielding , executing singly or together the resolutions formed in common ; four arms threatening the four cardinal points , or turning toward a single point -- must inevitably , either subterraneously , in open day , by mining , in the trench , by cunning , or by force , open themselves a way toward the object they wished to attain , however well it might be defended , or however distant it may seem .",104

"i gazed upon these wonders in silence . words failed me to express my feelings . i felt as if i was in some distant planet uranus or neptune -- and in the presence of phenomena of which my terrestrial experience gave me no cognisance . for such novel sensations , new words were wanted ; and my imagination failed to supply them . i gazed , i thought , i admired , with a stupefaction mingled with a certain amount of fear .",24

"the effect of these replies upon the already suspicious and excited detective may be imagined . the hasty departure from london soon after the robbery ; the large sum carried by mr . fogg ; his eagerness to reach distant countries ; the pretext of an eccentric and foolhardy bet -- all confirmed fix in his theory . he continued to pump poor passepartout , and learned that he really knew little or nothing of his master , who lived a solitary existence in london , was said to be rich , though no one knew whence came his riches , and was mysterious and impenetrable in his affairs and habits . fix felt sure that phileas fogg would not land at suez , but was really going on to bombay .",39
"a distant bell tinkled : immediately three ladies entered the room , each walked to a table and took her seat .",1
"we were hardly thinking of that . stromboli ! what an effect this unexpected name produced upon my mind ! we were in the midst of the mediterranean sea , on an island of the æolian archipelago , in the ancient strongyle , where æolus kept the winds and the storms chained up , to be let loose at his will . and those distant blue mountains in the east were the mountains of calabria . and that threatening volcano far away in the south was the fierce etna .",64

"i had three encouragements—1st , a smooth , calm sea ; 2ndly , the tide rising , and setting in to the shore ; 3rdly , what little wind there was blew me towards the land . and thus , having found two or three broken oars belonging to the boat — and , besides the tools which were in the chest , i found two saws , an axe , and a hammer ; with this cargo i put to sea . for a mile or thereabouts my raft went very well , only that i found it drive a little distant from the place where i had landed before ; by which i perceived that there was some indraft of the water , and consequently i hoped to find some creek or river there , which i might make use of as a port to get to land with my cargo .",102

"we had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from the road and wound away across the moor . a steep , boulder - sprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone days been cut into a granite quarry . the face which was turned towards us formed a dark cliff , with ferns and brambles growing in its niches . from over a distant rise there floated a gray plume of smoke .",70
"finally this long night was over . my imperfect memories wo n't let me recall my every impression of it . a single detail comes back to me . several times , during various lulls of wind and sea , i thought i heard indistinct sounds , a sort of elusive harmony produced by distant musical chords . what was the secret behind this underwater navigating , whose explanation the whole world had sought in vain ? what beings lived inside this strange boat ? what mechanical force allowed it to move about with such prodigious speed ?",54

"inside the mediterranean , then , i could catch no more of its fast - passing scenery than a traveler might see from an express train ; in other words , i could view only the distant horizons because the foregrounds flashed by like lightning . but conseil and i were able to observe those mediterranean fish whose powerful fins kept pace for a while in the nautilus 's waters . we stayed on watch before the lounge windows , and our notes enable me to reconstruct , in a few words , the ichthyology of this sea .",36

"presentiments are strange things ! and so are sympathies ; and so are signs ; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not yet found the key . i never laughed at presentiments in my life , because i have had strange ones of my own . sympathies , i believe , exist ( for instance , between far - distant , long - absent , wholly estranged relatives asserting , notwithstanding their alienation , the unity of the source to which each traces his origin ) whose workings baffle mortal comprehension . and signs , for aught we know , may be but the sympathies of nature with man .",64
