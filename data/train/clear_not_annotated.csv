"just then the gulf stream 's speed was 2.25 meters per second . so distinct is its current from the surrounding sea , its confined waters stand out against the ocean and operate on a different level from the colder waters . murky as well , and very rich in saline material , their pure indigo contrasts with the green waves surrounding them . moreover , their line of demarcation is so clear that abreast of the carolinas , the nautilus 's spur cut the waves of the gulf stream while its propeller was still churning those belonging to the ocean .",72
"firm , faithful , and devoted , full of energy , and zeal , and truth , he labours for his race ; he clears their painful way to improvement ; he hews down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it .",24
"on the 11th we reached cape portland . the clear open weather gave us a good view of myrdals jokul , which overhangs it . the cape is merely a low hill with steep sides , standing lonely by the beach .",9

"the next day i woke up with my head unusually clear . much to my surprise , i was in my stateroom . no doubt my companions had been put back in their cabin without noticing it any more than i had . like me , they would have no idea what took place during the night , and to unravel this mystery i could count only on some future happenstance .",10

"at the point where the sailor had left his raft of wood , it began to run between the two high granite walls ; but if on the left bank the wall remained clear and abrupt , on the right bank , on the contrary , it sank gradually , the massive sides changed to isolated rocks , the rocks to stones , the stones to shingle running to the extremity of the point .",33
"we had finally arrived on the outskirts of this forest , surely one of the finest in captain nemo 's immense domains . he regarded it as his own and had laid the same claim to it that , in the first days of the world , the first men had to their forests on land . besides , who else could dispute his ownership of this underwater property ? what other , bolder pioneer would come , ax in hand , to clear away its dark underbrush ?",83
"he jumped up and seized her roughly by the arm . "" show him to me . which is he ? point him out . i must see him ! "" he exclaimed ; but at that moment the duke of berwick 's four - in - hand came between , and when it had left the space clear , the carriage had swept out of the park .",58

"the captain stopped suddenly . a gesture from him brought us to a halt , and however much i wanted to clear this wall , i had to stop . here ended the domains of captain nemo . he had no desire to pass beyond them . farther on lay a part of the globe he would no longer tread underfoot .",21

"they dispersed about the room , reminding me , by the lightness and buoyancy of their movements , of a flock of white plumy birds . some of them threw themselves in half - reclining positions on the sofas and ottomans : some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books : the rest gathered in a group round the fire : all talked in a low but clear tone which seemed habitual to them .",70
"meanwhile preparations for this daring attempt were getting under way . the nautilus 's powerful pumps forced air down into the tanks and stored it under high pressure . near four o'clock captain nemo informed me that the platform hatches were about to be closed . i took a last look at the dense ice bank we were going to conquer . the weather was fair , the skies reasonably clear , the cold quite brisk , namely -12 degrees centigrade ; but after the wind had lulled , this temperature did n't seem too unbearable .",70
"we had , first and last , killed about threescore of them , and had it been daylight we had killed many more . the field of battle being thus cleared , we made forward again , for we had still near a league to go . we heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the woods as we went several times , and sometimes we fancied we saw some of them ; but the snow dazzling our eyes , we were not certain . in about an hour more we came to the town where we were to lodge , which we found in a terrible fright and all in arms ; for , it seems , the night before the wolves and some bears had broken into the village , and put them in such terror that they were obliged to keep guard night and day , but especially in the night , to preserve their cattle , and indeed their people .",30
"> from this point onward i will follow the course of events by transcribing my own letters to mr . sherlock holmes which lie before me on the table . one page is missing , but otherwise they are exactly as written and show my feelings and suspicions of the moment more accurately than my memory , clear as it is upon these tragic events , can possibly do .",57
"the place was cleared , carefully weeded , and searched for insects and worms ; then a bed of good earth , improved with a little lime , was made ; it was surrounded by a railing ; and the grain was buried in the damp earth .",3
"because newfoundland is simply an underwater peak , you could call these cod mountain fish . while the nautilus was clearing a path through their tight ranks , conseil could n't refrain from making this comment :",20
"i speak particularly of the young ladies . st . john 's eyes , though clear enough in a literal sense , in a figurative one were difficult to fathom . he seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people 's thoughts , than as agents to reveal his own : the which combination of keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than to encourage .",15

"there the ocean floor formed a valley 120 kilometers wide , into which you could fit mt . blanc without its summit poking above the surface of the waves . this valley is closed off to the east by a sheer wall 2,000 meters high . we arrived there on may 28 , and the nautilus lay no farther than 150 kilometers from ireland . would captain nemo head up north and beach us on the british isles ? no . much to my surprise , he went back down south and returned to european seas . as we swung around the emerald isle , i spotted cape clear for an instant , plus the lighthouse on fastnet rock that guides all those thousands of ships setting out from glasgow or liverpool .",108
"the next day , june 1 , the nautilus kept to the same tack . it was obviously trying to locate some precise spot in the ocean . just as on the day before , captain nemo came to take the altitude of the sun . the sea was smooth , the skies clear . eight miles to the east , a big steamship was visible on the horizon line . no flag was flapping from the gaff of its fore - and - aft sail , and i could n't tell its nationality .",53

"but as beautiful as it was , i could get only a quick look at this basin whose surface area comprises 2,000,000 square kilometers . even captain nemo 's personal insights were denied me , because that mystifying individual did n't appear one single time during our high - speed crossing . i estimate that the nautilus covered a track of some 600 leagues under the waves of this sea , and this voyage was accomplished in just twenty - four hours times two . departing from the waterways of greece on the morning of february 16 , we cleared the strait of gibraltar by sunrise on the 18th .",99
