"meanwhile they were progressing famously , and john bunsby was in high hope . he several times assured mr . fogg that they would reach shanghai in time ; to which that gentleman responded that he counted upon it . the crew set to work in good earnest , inspired by the reward to be gained . there was not a sheet which was not tightened , not a sail which was not vigorously hoisted ; not a lurch could be charged to the man at the helm . they worked as desperately as if they were contesting in a royal yacht regatta .",55

"traversing the long and matted gallery , i descended the slippery steps of oak ; then i gained the hall : i halted there a minute ; i looked at some pictures on the walls ( one , i remember , represented a grim man in a cuirass , and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace ) , at a bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling , at a great clock whose case was of oak curiously carved , and ebon black with time and rubbing .",17
"for the next hour our frigate kept up this pace without gaining a fathom ! this was humiliating for one of the fastest racers in the american navy . the crew were working up into a blind rage . sailor after sailor heaved insults at the monster , which could n't be bothered with answering back . commander farragut was no longer content simply to twist his goatee ; he chewed on it .",11

"the steamer which was about to depart from yokohama to san francisco belonged to the pacific mail steamship company , and was named the general grant . she was a large paddle - wheel steamer of two thousand five hundred tons ; well equipped and very fast . the massive walking - beam rose and fell above the deck ; at one end a piston - rod worked up and down ; and at the other was a connecting - rod which , in changing the rectilinear motion to a circular one , was directly connected with the shaft of the paddles . the general grant was rigged with three masts , giving a large capacity for sails , and thus materially aiding the steam power . by making twelve miles an hour , she would cross the ocean in twenty - one days . phileas fogg was therefore justified in hoping that he would reach san francisco by the 2nd of december , new york by the 11th , and london on the 20th -- thus gaining several hours on the fatal date of the 21st of december .",177
"in journeying eastward he had gone towards the sun , and the days therefore diminished for him as many times four minutes as he crossed degrees in this direction . there are three hundred and sixty degrees on the circumference of the earth ; and these three hundred and sixty degrees , multiplied by four minutes , gives precisely twenty - four hours -- that is , the day unconsciously gained . in other words , while phileas fogg , going eastward , saw the sun pass the meridian eighty times , his friends in london only saw it pass the meridian seventy - nine times . this is why they awaited him at the reform club on saturday , and not sunday , as mr . fogg thought .",70
"phileas fogg , then , had won the twenty thousand pounds ; but , as he had spent nearly nineteen thousand on the way , the pecuniary gain was small . his object was , however , to be victorious , and not to win money . he divided the one thousand pounds that remained between passepartout and the unfortunate fix , against whom he cherished no grudge . he deducted , however , from passepartout 's share the cost of the gas which had burned in his room for nineteen hundred and twenty hours , for the sake of regularity .",27

"the two castaways , john ferrier and the little girl who had shared his fortunes and had been adopted as his daughter , accompanied the mormons to the end of their great pilgrimage . little lucy ferrier was borne along pleasantly enough in elder stangerson 's waggon , a retreat which she shared with the mormon 's three wives and with his son , a headstrong forward boy of twelve . having rallied , with the elasticity of childhood , from the shock caused by her mother 's death , she soon became a pet with the women , and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving canvas - covered home . in the meantime ferrier having recovered from his privations , distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable hunter . so rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions , that when they reached the end of their wanderings , it was unanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers , with the exception of young himself , and of stangerson , kemball , johnston , and drebber , who were the four principal elders .",139

"aouda , leaning upon mr . fogg 's arm , observed the tumultuous scene with surprise , while fix asked a man near him what the cause of it all was . before the man could reply , a fresh agitation arose ; hurrahs and excited shouts were heard ; the staffs of the banners began to be used as offensive weapons ; and fists flew about in every direction . thumps were exchanged from the tops of the carriages and omnibuses which had been blocked up in the crowd . boots and shoes went whirling through the air , and mr . fogg thought he even heard the crack of revolvers mingling in the din , the rout approached the stairway , and flowed over the lower step . one of the parties had evidently been repulsed ; but the mere lookers - on could not tell whether mandiboy or camerfield had gained the upper hand .",153

"ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes , jefferson hope had the scanty provisions and water , while lucy had a small bundle containing a few of her more valued possessions . opening the window very slowly and carefully , they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night , and then one by one passed through into the little garden . with bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it , and gained the shelter of the hedge , which they skirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfields . they had just reached this point when the young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the shadow , where they lay silent and trembling .",77

""" this was the first point gained . i then walked slowly down the garden path , which happened to be composed of a clay soil , peculiarly suitable for taking impressions . no doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush , but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning . there is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps . happily , i have always laid great stress upon it , and much practice has made it second nature to me . i saw the heavy footmarks of the constables , but i saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden . it was easy to tell that they had been before the others , because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them . in this way my second link was formed , which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number , one remarkable for his height ( as i calculated from the length of his stride ) , and the other fashionably dressed , to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots .",6
