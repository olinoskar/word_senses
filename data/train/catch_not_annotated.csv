"when the nautilus returned to the surface of the ocean , i could take in reao island over its whole flat , wooded expanse . obviously its madreporic rocks had been made fertile by tornadoes and thunderstorms . one day , carried off by a hurricane from neighboring shores , some seed fell onto these limestone beds , mixing with decomposed particles of fish and marine plants to form vegetable humus . propelled by the waves , a coconut arrived on this new coast . its germ took root . its tree grew tall , catching steam off the water . a brook was born . little by little , vegetation spread . tiny animals -- worms , insects -- rode ashore on tree trunks snatched from islands to windward . turtles came to lay their eggs . birds nested in the young trees . in this way animal life developed , and drawn by the greenery and fertile soil , man appeared . and that 's how these islands were formed , the immense achievement of microscopic animals .",95

"just then my eye was caught by some etchings hanging on the wall , which i had n't noticed during my first visit . they were portraits of great men of history who had spent their lives in perpetual devotion to a great human ideal : thaddeus kosciusko , the hero whose dying words had been finis poloniae ; markos botzaris , for modern greece the reincarnation of sparta 's king leonidas ; daniel o'connell , ireland 's defender ; george washington , founder of the american union ; daniele manin , the italian patriot ; abraham lincoln , dead from the bullet of a believer in slavery ; and finally , that martyr for the redemption of the black race , john brown , hanging from his gallows as victor hugo 's pencil has so terrifyingly depicted .",5

"at half - past twelve the travellers caught sight for an instant of fort halleck , which commands that section ; and in a few more hours the rocky mountains were crossed . there was reason to hope , then , that no accident would mark the journey through this difficult country . the snow had ceased falling , and the air became crisp and cold . large birds , frightened by the locomotive , rose and flew off in the distance . no wild beast appeared on the plain . it was a desert in its vast nakedness .",7
"jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive glance of some stranger . he had that dislike of being stared at , which comes on geniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace . sibyl , however , was quite unconscious of the effect she was producing . her love was trembling in laughter on her lips . she was thinking of prince charming , and , that she might think of him all the more , she did not talk of him , but prattled on about the ship in which jim was going to sail , about the gold he was certain to find , about the wonderful heiress whose life he was to save from the wicked , red - shirted bushrangers . for he was not to remain a sailor , or a supercargo , or whatever he was going to be . oh , no ! a sailor 's existence was dreadful . fancy being cooped up in a horrid ship , with the hoarse , hump - backed waves trying to get in , and a black wind blowing the masts down and tearing the sails into long screaming ribands !",8
the three friends looked at one another and laughed ; they were caught .,12
"the train was about to start from allahabad , and mr . fogg proceeded to pay the guide the price agreed upon for his service , and not a farthing more ; which astonished passepartout , who remembered all that his master owed to the guide 's devotion . he had , indeed , risked his life in the adventure at pillaji , and , if he should be caught afterwards by the indians , he would with difficulty escape their vengeance . kiouni , also , must be disposed of . what should be done with the elephant , which had been so dearly purchased ? phileas fogg had already determined this question .",69

"she made her brother talk of himself , his hopes , his prospects . he spoke slowly and with effort . they passed words to each other as players at a game pass counters . sibyl felt oppressed . she could not communicate her joy . a faint smile curving that sullen mouth was all the echo she could win . after some time she became silent . suddenly she caught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing lips , and in an open carriage with two ladies dorian gray drove past .",70

"at ten o'clock in the evening , the skies caught on fire . the air was streaked with violent flashes of lightning . i could n't stand this brightness , but captain nemo stared straight at it , as if to inhale the spirit of the storm . a dreadful noise filled the air , a complicated noise made up of the roar of crashing breakers , the howl of the wind , claps of thunder . the wind shifted to every point of the horizon , and the cyclone left the east to return there after passing through north , west , and south , moving in the opposite direction of revolving storms in the southern hemisphere .",9

"one of these , concerning which i have said little , is the escaped convict upon the moor . there is strong reason now to believe that he has got right away , which is a considerable relief to the lonely householders of this district . a fortnight has passed since his flight , during which he has not been seen and nothing has been heard of him . it is surely inconceivable that he could have held out upon the moor during all that time . of course , so far as his concealment goes there is no difficulty at all . any one of these stone huts would give him a hiding - place . but there is nothing to eat unless he were to catch and slaughter one of the moor sheep . we think , therefore , that he has gone , and the outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence .",127

"from the corner of the divan of persian saddle - bags on which he was lying , smoking , as was his custom , innumerable cigarettes , lord henry wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey - sweet and honey- coloured blossoms of a laburnum , whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs ; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore - silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window , producing a kind of momentary japanese effect , and making him think of those pallid , jade - faced painters of tokio who , through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile , seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion .",32

"all in all , we enjoyed a highly satisfactory state of health . the diet on board agreed with us perfectly , and for my part , i could easily have gone without those changes of pace that ned land , in a spirit of protest , kept taxing his ingenuity to supply us . what 's more , in this constant temperature we did n't even have to worry about catching colds . besides , the ship had a good stock of the madrepore dendrophylia , known in provence by the name sea fennel , and a poultice made from the dissolved flesh of its polyps will furnish an excellent cough medicine .",71

"inside the mediterranean , then , i could catch no more of its fast - passing scenery than a traveler might see from an express train ; in other words , i could view only the distant horizons because the foregrounds flashed by like lightning . but conseil and i were able to observe those mediterranean fish whose powerful fins kept pace for a while in the nautilus 's waters . we stayed on watch before the lounge windows , and our notes enable me to reconstruct , in a few words , the ichthyology of this sea .",8
