"passing near these unusual animals , i could examine them at my leisure since they did n't stir . their hides were rough and heavy , a tan color leaning toward a reddish brown ; their coats were short and less than abundant . some were four meters long . more tranquil and less fearful than their northern relatives , they posted no sentinels on guard duty at the approaches to their campsite .",20
