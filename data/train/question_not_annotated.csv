"the question of carrying the city by assault , though often debated in the council of the king , had been always rejected . in the first place , la rochelle appeared impregnable . then the cardinal , whatever he said , very well knew that the horror of bloodshed in this encounter , in which frenchman would combat against frenchman , was a retrograde movement of sixty years impressed upon his policy ; and the cardinal was at that period what we now call a man of progress .",1
