""" what a place to find one 's divinity in ! "" said lord henry .",14
""" look here , barrymore , "" said sir henry , sternly ; "" we have made up our minds to have the truth out of you , so it will save you trouble to tell it sooner rather than later . come , now ! no lies ! what were you doing at that window ? """,9
"a quarter of an hour afterwards , amidst an extraordinary turmoil of applause , sibyl vane stepped on to the stage . yes , she was certainly lovely to look at-- one of the loveliest creatures , lord henry thought , that he had ever seen . there was something of the fawn in her shy grace and startled eyes . a faint blush , like the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver , came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded enthusiastic house . she stepped back a few paces and her lips seemed to tremble . basil hallward leaped to his feet and began to applaud . motionless , and as one in a dream , sat dorian gray , gazing at her . lord henry peered through his glasses , murmuring , "" charming ! charming ! """,132
"a week later dorian gray was sitting in the conservatory at selby royal , talking to the pretty duchess of monmouth , who with her husband , a jaded - looking man of sixty , was amongst his guests . it was tea- time , and the mellow light of the huge , lace - covered lamp that stood on the table lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service at which the duchess was presiding . her white hands were moving daintily among the cups , and her full red lips were smiling at something that dorian had whispered to her . lord henry was lying back in a silk - draped wicker chair , looking at them . on a peach - coloured divan sat lady narborough , pretending to listen to the duke 's description of the last brazilian beetle that he had added to his collection . three young men in elaborate smoking - suits were handing tea - cakes to some of the women . the house - party consisted of twelve people , and there were more expected to arrive on the next day .",107
lord henry stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his patent - leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane .,1
""" then why wo n't you exhibit his portrait ? "" asked lord henry .",13
""" i wo n't hear of it , "" laughed lord henry , sinking into a chair . "" from a label there is no escape ! i refuse the title . """,11
""" they are both simply forms of imitation , "" remarked lord henry . "" but do let us go . dorian , you must not stay here any longer . it is not good for one 's morals to see bad acting . besides , i do n't suppose you will want your wife to act , so what does it matter if she plays juliet like a wooden doll ? she is very lovely , and if she knows as little about life as she does about acting , she will be a delightful experience . there are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating-- people who know absolutely everything , and people who know absolutely nothing . good heavens , my dear boy , do n't look so tragic ! the secret of remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming . come to the club with basil and myself . we will smoke cigarettes and drink to the beauty of sibyl vane . she is beautiful . what more can you want ? """,12
""" let us go , basil , "" said lord henry with a strange tenderness in his voice , and the two young men passed out together .",10
""" days in summer , basil , are apt to linger , "" murmured lord henry . "" perhaps you will tire sooner than he will . it is a sad thing to think of , but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty . that accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over - educate ourselves . in the wild struggle for existence , we want to have something that endures , and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts , in the silly hope of keeping our place . the thoroughly well - informed man -- that is the modern ideal . and the mind of the thoroughly well - informed man is a dreadful thing . it is like a bric - a - brac shop , all monsters and dust , with everything priced above its proper value .",15
""" ah , my dear basil , that is exactly why i can feel it . those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love : it is the faithless who know love 's tragedies . "" and lord henry struck a light on a dainty silver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a self - conscious and satisfied air , as if he had summed up the world in a phrase .",41
"when they were gone we looked out of the window again . sir henry had flung it open , and the cold night wind beat in upon our faces . far away in the black distance there still glowed that one tiny point of yellow light .",13
""" you must introduce me now , "" cried lord henry , laughing .",10
""" what nonsense you talk ! "" said lord henry , smiling , and taking hallward by the arm , he almost led him into the house .",9
""" what business ? "" asked sir henry sharply . "" it seems to me that all you gentlemen know a great deal more than i do about my own affairs . """,7
""" you have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you , mr . gray , "" said lord henry , stepping forward and extending his hand . "" my aunt has often spoken to me about you . you are one of her favourites , and , i am afraid , one of her victims also . """,18
"yet it was watching him , with its beautiful marred face and its cruel smile . its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight . its blue eyes met his own . a sense of infinite pity , not for himself , but for the painted image of himself , came over him . it had altered already , and would alter more . its gold would wither into grey . its red and white roses would die . for every sin that he committed , a stain would fleck and wreck its fairness . but he would not sin . the picture , changed or unchanged , would be to him the visible emblem of conscience . he would resist temptation . he would not see lord henry any more -- would not , at any rate , listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in basil hallward 's garden had first stirred within him the passion for impossible things . he would go back to sibyl vane , make her amends , marry her , try to love her again . yes , it was his duty to do so . she must have suffered more than he had . poor child ! he had been selfish and cruel to her . the fascination that she had exercised over him would return . they would be happy together . his life with her would be beautiful and pure .",128

"" i do n't think there will be any difficulty about that . sit down again , harry . and now , dorian , get up on the platform , and do n't move about too much , or pay any attention to what lord henry says . he has a very bad influence over all his friends , with the single exception of myself . """,49
"dorian gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young greek martyr , and made a little moue of discontent to lord henry , to whom he had rather taken a fancy . he was so unlike basil . they made a delightful contrast . and he had such a beautiful voice . after a few moments he said to him , "" have you really a very bad influence , lord henry ? as bad as basil says ?

"he made no answer at first , but remained quite still . the knocking still continued and grew louder . yes , it was better to let lord henry in , and to explain to him the new life he was going to lead , to quarrel with him if it became necessary to quarrel , to part if parting was inevitable . he jumped up , drew the screen hastily across the picture , and unlocked the door .",28
""" and yet , "" continued lord henry , in his low , musical voice , and with that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of him , and that he had even in his eton days , "" i believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and completely , were to give form to every feeling , expression to every thought , reality to every dream -- i believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism , and return to the hellenic ideal-- to something finer , richer than the hellenic ideal , it may be . but the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself . the mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self - denial that mars our lives . we are punished for our refusals .",7
""" i am so sorry for it all , dorian , "" said lord henry as he entered . "" but you must not think too much about it . """,14
""" yes , of course , "" answered lord henry , sinking into a chair and slowly pulling off his yellow gloves . "" it is dreadful , from one point of view , but it was not your fault . tell me , did you go behind and see her , after the play was over ? """,9
"it was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog had lifted . meanwhile we left lestrade in possession of the house while holmes and i went back with the baronet to baskerville hall . the story of the stapletons could no longer be withheld from him , but he took the blow bravely when he learned the truth about the woman whom he had loved . but the shock of the night 's adventures had shattered his nerves , and before morning he lay delirious in a high fever , under the care of dr . mortimer . the two of them were destined to travel together round the world before sir henry had become once more the hale , hearty man that he had been before he became master of that ill - omened estate .",117
"with his subtle smile , lord henry watched him . he knew the precise psychological moment when to say nothing . he felt intensely interested . he was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had produced , and , remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen , a book which had revealed to him much that he had not known before , he wondered whether dorian gray was passing through a similar experience . he had merely shot an arrow into the air . had it hit the mark ? how fascinating the lad was !",6
""" like all good reputations , gladys , "" interrupted lord henry . "" every effect that one produces gives one an enemy . to be popular one must be a mediocrity . """,11
""" my dear gladys ! "" cried lord henry . "" how can you say that ? romance lives by repetition , and repetition converts an appetite into an art . besides , each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved . difference of object does not alter singleness of passion . it merely intensifies it . we can have in life but one great experience at best , and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible . """,8
"a cry of pain broke from the lad 's lips , and he leaped to his feet , tearing his hands away from lord henry 's grasp .",24
""" let us go and sit in the shade , "" said lord henry . "" parker has brought out the drinks , and if you stay any longer in this glare , you will be quite spoiled , and basil will never paint you again . you really must not allow yourself to become sunburnt . it would be unbecoming . """,13
""" even when one has been wounded by it , harry ? "" asked the duchess after a pause . "" especially when one has been wounded by it , "" answered lord henry .",33

"they walked side by side in the direction of the avenue for nearly fifty yards without speaking . then dorian looked at lord henry and said , with a heavy sigh , "" it is a bad omen , harry , a very bad omen . """,23
""" what is ? "" asked lord henry . "" oh ! this accident , i suppose . my dear fellow , it ca n't be helped . it was the man 's own fault . why did he get in front of the guns ? besides , it is nothing to us . it is rather awkward for geoffrey , of course . it does not do to pepper beaters . it makes people think that one is a wild shot . and geoffrey is not ; he shoots very straight . but there is no use talking about the matter . """,7
""" what a fuss people make about fidelity ! "" exclaimed lord henry . "" why , even in love it is purely a question for physiology . it has nothing to do with our own will . young men want to be faithful , and are not ; old men want to be faithless , and can not : that is all one can say . """,12

""" look at sir charles 's death ! that was bad enough , for all that the coroner said . look at the noises on the moor at night . there 's not a man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for it . look at this stranger hiding out yonder , and watching and waiting ! what 's he waiting for ? what does it mean ? it means no good to anyone of the name of baskerville , and very glad i shall be to be quit of it all on the day that sir henry 's new servants are ready to take over the hall . """,100
"dorian gray drew a long breath . the colour came back to his cheeks , and a smile played about his lips . the peril was over . he was safe for the time . yet he could not help feeling infinite pity for the painter who had just made this strange confession to him , and wondered if he himself would ever be so dominated by the personality of a friend . lord henry had the charm of being very dangerous . but that was all . he was too clever and too cynical to be really fond of . would there ever be some one who would fill him with a strange idolatry ? was that one of the things that life had in store ?",74
""" i wish i could trust myself , "" said lord henry , laughing . "" come , mr . gray , my hansom is outside , and i can drop you at your own place . good - bye , basil . it has been a most interesting afternoon . """,11
""" he is very good - looking , "" assented lord henry .",11
""" i do n't know , "" answered lord henry . "" i fancy that the boy will be well off . he is not of age yet . he has selby , i know . he told me so . and . . . his mother was very beautiful ? """,9
"he shuddered , and for a moment he regretted that he had not told basil the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away . basil would have helped him to resist lord henry 's influence , and the still more poisonous influences that came from his own temperament . the love that he bore him -- for it was really love-- had nothing in it that was not noble and intellectual . it was not that mere physical admiration of beauty that is born of the senses and that dies when the senses tire . it was such love as michelangelo had known , and montaigne , and winckelmann , and shakespeare himself . yes , basil could have saved him . but it was too late now . the past could always be annihilated . regret , denial , or forgetfulness could do that . but the future was inevitable . there were passions in him that would find their terrible outlet , dreams that would make the shadow of their evil real .",36
"she laughed again . her teeth showed like white seeds in a scarlet fruit . upstairs , in his own room , dorian gray was lying on a sofa , with terror in every tingling fibre of his body . life had suddenly become too hideous a burden for him to bear . the dreadful death of the unlucky beater , shot in the thicket like a wild animal , had seemed to him to pre - figure death for himself also . he had nearly swooned at what lord henry had said in a chance mood of cynical jesting .",90
the old gentleman growled approvingly and rang the bell for his servant . lord henry passed up the low arcade into burlington street and turned his steps in the direction of berkeley square .,14
"he sighed , and having poured himself out some tea , opened lord henry 's note . it was simply to say that he sent him round the evening paper , and a book that might interest him , and that he would be at the club at eight - fifteen . he opened the st . james 's languidly , and looked through it . a red pencil - mark on the fifth page caught his eye . it drew attention to the following paragraph :",13
"he frowned , and tearing the paper in two , went across the room and flung the pieces away . how ugly it all was ! and how horribly real ugliness made things ! he felt a little annoyed with lord henry for having sent him the report . and it was certainly stupid of him to have marked it with red pencil . victor might have read it . the man knew more than enough english for that .",41
"his eye fell on the yellow book that lord henry had sent him . what was it , he wondered . he went towards the little , pearl - coloured octagonal stand that had always looked to him like the work of some strange egyptian bees that wrought in silver , and taking up the volume , flung himself into an arm - chair and began to turn over the leaves . after a few minutes he became absorbed . it was the strangest book that he had ever read . it seemed to him that in exquisite raiment , and to the delicate sound of flutes , the sins of the world were passing in dumb show before him . things that he had dimly dreamed of were suddenly made real to him . things of which he had never dreamed were gradually revealed .",9
""" american novels , "" answered lord henry , helping himself to some quail .",7
"it was almost nine o'clock before he reached the club , where he found lord henry sitting alone , in the morning - room , looking very much bored .",15
""" i should think the novelty of the emotion must have given you a thrill of real pleasure , dorian , "" interrupted lord henry . "" but i can finish your idyll for you . you gave her good advice and broke her heart . that was the beginning of your reformation . """,24
""" and weep over a faithless florizel , "" said lord henry , laughing , as he leaned back in his chair .

""" ah , you have discovered that ? "" murmured lord henry . and they passed into the dining - room .",11
""" they go to america , "" murmured lord henry .",9
"there were moments , indeed , at night , when , lying sleepless in his own delicately scented chamber , or in the sordid room of the little ill - famed tavern near the docks which , under an assumed name and in disguise , it was his habit to frequent , he would think of the ruin he had brought upon his soul with a pity that was all the more poignant because it was purely selfish . but moments such as these were rare . that curiosity about life which lord henry had first stirred in him , as they sat together in the garden of their friend , seemed to increase with gratification . the more he knew , the more he desired to know . he had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them .",93
""" how dreadful ! "" cried lord henry . "" i can stand brute force , but brute reason is quite unbearable . there is something unfair about its use . it is hitting below the intellect . """,7
"my feelings towards him were very far from being friendly after what i had heard of his treatment of his daughter , but i was anxious to send perkins and the wagonette home , and the opportunity was a good one . i alighted and sent a message to sir henry that i should walk over in time for dinner . then i followed frankland into his dining - room .",50
""" i do , lord henry , "" murmured mr . erskine , with a smile .",5
"dorian heaved a sigh , and lord henry strolled across the room and began to stroke the head of a curious java parrot , a large , grey - plumaged bird with pink crest and tail , that was balancing itself upon a bamboo perch . as his pointed fingers touched it , it dropped the white scurf of crinkled lids over black , glasslike eyes and began to sway backwards and forwards .",7
""" i want him to play to me , "" cried lord henry , smiling , and he looked down the table and caught a bright answering glance .",12
"yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many his strange and dangerous charm . his great wealth was a certain element of security . society -- civilized society , at least-- is never very ready to believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and fascinating . it feels instinctively that manners are of more importance than morals , and , in its opinion , the highest respectability is of much less value than the possession of a good chef . and , after all , it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has given one a bad dinner , or poor wine , is irreproachable in his private life . even the cardinal virtues can not atone for half - cold entrées , as lord henry remarked once , in a discussion on the subject , and there is possibly a good deal to be said for his view . for the canons of good society are , or should be , the same as the canons of art . form is absolutely essential to it . it should have the dignity of a ceremony , as well as its unreality , and should combine the insincere character of a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us . is insincerity such a terrible thing ? i think not . it is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities .",138
""" i can sympathize with everything except suffering , "" said lord henry , shrugging his shoulders . "" i can not sympathize with that . it is too ugly , too horrible , too distressing . there is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain . one should sympathize with the colour , the beauty , the joy of life . the less said about life 's sores , the better .

"he was walking home about eleven o'clock from lord henry 's , where he had been dining , and was wrapped in heavy furs , as the night was cold and foggy . at the corner of grosvenor square and south audley street , a man passed him in the mist , walking very fast and with the collar of his grey ulster turned up . he had a bag in his hand . dorian recognized him . it was basil hallward . a strange sense of fear , for which he could not account , came over him . he made no sign of recognition and went on quickly in the direction of his own house .",9

"barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against the glass . his profile was half turned towards me , and his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the moor . for some minutes he stood watching intently . then he gave a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light . instantly i made my way back to my room , and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing once more upon their return journey . long afterwards when i had fallen into a light sleep i heard a key turn somewhere in a lock , but i could not tell whence the sound came . what it all means i can not guess , but there is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of . i do not trouble you with my theories , for you asked me to furnish you only with facts . i have had a long talk with sir henry this morning , and we have made a plan of campaign founded upon my observations of last night . i will not speak about it just now , but it should make my next report interesting reading .",184
""" of course it is true , lord henry . if we women did not love you for your defects , where would you all be ? not one of you would ever be married . you would be a set of unfortunate bachelors . not , however , that that would alter you much . nowadays all the married men live like bachelors , and all the bachelors like married men . """,8
""" ah , my dear , "" cried lady narborough , putting on her gloves , "" do n't tell me that you have exhausted life . when a man says that one knows that life has exhausted him . lord henry is very wicked , and i sometimes wish that i had been ; but you are made to be good-- you look so good . i must find you a nice wife . lord henry , do n't you think that mr . gray should get married ? """,41
""" i am always telling him so , lady narborough , "" said lord henry with a bow .",14
""" what nonsense people talk about happy marriages ! "" exclaimed lord henry . "" a man can be happy with any woman , as long as he does not love her . """,12
""" pray do n't , lady ruxton , "" said lord henry . "" moderation is a fatal thing . enough is as bad as a meal . more than enough is as good as a feast . """,11
""" yes . i was telling sir henry that it was rather late for him to see the true beauties of the moor . """,7
""" i like him , "" said lord henry . "" a great many people do n't , but i find him charming . he atones for being occasionally somewhat overdressed by being always absolutely over - educated . he is a very modern type . """,8
""" no , no . i remember the thrill in your voice . i remember the look in your eyes . please , please , be frank with me , miss stapleton , for ever since i have been here i have been conscious of shadows all round me . life has become like that great grimpen mire , with little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track . tell me then what it was that you meant , and i will promise to convey your warning to sir henry . """,98
"i suppose you have heard the news , basil ? "" said lord henry that evening as hallward was shown into a little private room at the bristol where dinner had been laid for three .",13
""" because it is the place of danger . that is sir henry 's nature . i fear that unless you can give me some more definite information than this it would be impossible to get him to move . """,12
"lying back in the hansom , with his hat pulled over his forehead , dorian gray watched with listless eyes the sordid shame of the great city , and now and then he repeated to himself the words that lord henry had said to him on the first day they had met , "" to cure the soul by means of the senses , and the senses by means of the soul . "" yes , that was the secret . he had often tried it , and would try it again now . there were opium dens where one could buy oblivion , dens of horror where the memory of old sins could be destroyed by the madness of sins that were new .",40
""" did the boy deliver it into your own hands ? "" asked sir henry .",14
""" and i do n't forgive you for being late for dinner , "" broke in lord henry , putting his hand on the lad 's shoulder and smiling as he spoke . "" come , let us sit down and try what the new chef here is like , and then you will tell us how it all came about . """,17
""" none . the only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was rodger baskerville , the youngest of three brothers of whom poor sir charles was the elder . the second brother , who died young , is the father of this lad henry . the third , rodger , was the black sheep of the family . he came of the old masterful baskerville strain , and was the very image , they tell me , of the family picture of old hugo . he made england too hot to hold him , fled to central america , and died there in 1876 of yellow fever . henry is the last of the baskervilles . in one hour and five minutes i meet him at waterloo station . i have had a wire that he arrived at southampton this morning . now , mr . holmes , what would you advise me to do with him ? """,111
""" have you seen her to - day ? "" asked lord henry .",12
"his plan of campaign was beginning to be evident . he would use the baronet in order to convince the stapletons that we were really gone , while we should actually return at the instant when we were likely to be needed . that telegram from london , if mentioned by sir henry to the stapletons , must remove the last suspicions from their minds . already i seemed to see our nets drawing closer around that lean - jawed pike .",52
lord henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed .,1
"lord henry sipped his champagne in a meditative manner . "" at what particular point did you mention the word marriage , dorian ? and what did she say in answer ? perhaps you forgot all about it . """,1
"lord henry looked across the table . "" dorian is never annoyed with me , "" he answered . "" i asked the question for the best reason possible , for the only reason , indeed , that excuses one for asking any question-- simple curiosity . i have a theory that it is always the women who propose to us , and not we who propose to the women . except , of course , in middle - class life . but then the middle classes are not modern . """,1
""" and those are ... ? "" asked lord henry , helping himself to some salad .",9
""" being natural is simply a pose , and the most irritating pose i know , "" cried lord henry , laughing ; and the two young men went out into the garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush . the sunlight slipped over the polished leaves . in the grass , white daisies were tremulous .",19
"after a pause , lord henry pulled out his watch . "" i am afraid i must be going , basil , "" he murmured , "" and before i go , i insist on your answering a question i put to you some time ago . """,5
""" yes , "" echoed dorian , leaning back in his chair and looking at lord henry over the heavy clusters of purple - lipped irises that stood in the centre of the table , "" what do you mean by good , harry ? """,16
""" he could not hope to frighten sir henry to death as he had done the old uncle with his bogie hound . """,8
""" nothing is ever quite true , "" said lord henry .",10
"lord henry smiled , and leaning down , plucked a pink - petalled daisy from the grass and examined it . "" i am quite sure i shall understand it , "" he replied , gazing intently at the little golden , white - feathered disk , "" and as for believing things , i can believe anything , provided that it is quite incredible . """,1
"we had arranged no plan of campaign , but the baronet is a man to whom the most direct way is always the most natural . he walked into the room , and as he did so barrymore sprang up from the window with a sharp hiss of his breath and stood , livid and trembling , before us . his dark eyes , glaring out of the white mask of his face , were full of horror and astonishment as he gazed from sir henry to me .",85
"for some reason or other , the house was crowded that night , and the fat jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear to ear with an oily tremulous smile . he escorted them to their box with a sort of pompous humility , waving his fat jewelled hands and talking at the top of his voice . dorian gray loathed him more than ever . he felt as if he had come to look for miranda and had been met by caliban . lord henry , upon the other hand , rather liked him . at least he declared he did , and insisted on shaking him by the hand and assuring him that he was proud to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone bankrupt over a poet .",90
