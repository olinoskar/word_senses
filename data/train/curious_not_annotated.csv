"was phileas fogg rich ? undoubtedly . but those who knew him best could not imagine how he had made his fortune , and mr . fogg was the last person to whom to apply for the information . he was not lavish , nor , on the contrary , avaricious ; for , whenever he knew that money was needed for a noble , useful , or benevolent purpose , he supplied it quietly and sometimes anonymously . he was , in short , the least communicative of men . he talked very little , and seemed all the more mysterious for his taciturn manner . his daily habits were quite open to observation ; but whatever he did was so exactly the same thing that he had always done before , that the wits of the curious were fairly puzzled .",138

"candide and cacambo were placed on this machine , and they took with them two large red sheep , bridled and saddled , to ride upon , when they got on the other side of the mountains ; twenty others to serve as sumpters for carrying provisions ; thirty laden with presents of whatever was most curious in the country , and fifty with gold , diamonds , and other precious stones .",56
"there mr . fogg examined a curious vehicle , a kind of frame on two long beams , a little raised in front like the runners of a sledge , and upon which there was room for five or six persons . a high mast was fixed on the frame , held firmly by metallic lashings , to which was attached a large brigantine sail . this mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist a jib - sail . behind , a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle . it was , in short , a sledge rigged like a sloop . during the winter , when the trains are blocked up by the snow , these sledges make extremely rapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another . provided with more sails than a cutter , and with the wind behind them , they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not superior to that of the express trains .",6
