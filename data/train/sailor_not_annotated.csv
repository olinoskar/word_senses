"cyrus harding smiled at the sailor 's idea , and , yielding to his wish , he opened exactly at a place where the leaves were separated by a marker .",5
""" do you know what this plant is ? "" asked herbert of the sailor .",14
the hardy sailor could not restrain a burst of laughter on seeing the efforts of the lad to succeed where he had failed .,2
""" it is not more difficult than that , "" cried the reporter , striking the sailor on the shoulder .",16
"however , pencroft had thought of doing so , but cyrus harding having told him that even if he managed to count three hundred grains a minute , or nine thousand an hour , it would take him nearly five thousand five - hundred years to finish his task , the honest sailor considered it best to give up the idea .",52
""" yes , fire ! "" said the obstinate sailor again .",9
"the boat was pushed on through the forest , which gradually became thicker again , and appeared also to have more inhabitants ; for if the eyes of the sailor did not deceive him , he thought he saw bands of monkeys springing among the trees .",29
""" pencroft , "" said herbert , taking the sailor 's hand , "" we will build another ' bonadventure'--a larger one .",9
"the passengers , with the exception of the sailor , scarcely slept as well on board the "" bonadventure "" as they would have done in their rooms at granite house , but they did sleep however .",8
"as may be seen , the sailor 's confidence in the tutelary deity of his island was absolute , and , certainly , the occult power , manifested until now in so many inexplicable ways , appeared to be unlimited ; but also it knew how to escape the colonists ' most minute researches , for , in spite of all their efforts , in spite of the more than zeal,--the obstinacy,--with which they carried on their exploration , the retreat of the mysterious being could not be discovered .",6
"pencroft , as a good sailor , was prepared for anything .",5
"and the sailor sounded with a long cord , which served him as a lead - line , and to which was fastened a lump of iron .",2
"for the next hour our frigate kept up this pace without gaining a fathom ! this was humiliating for one of the fastest racers in the american navy . the crew were working up into a blind rage . sailor after sailor heaved insults at the monster , which could n't be bothered with answering back . commander farragut was no longer content simply to twist his goatee ; he chewed on it .",39

"and the sailor pointed to a great white rag , caught in the top of the pine , a fallen scrap of which the dog had brought to them .",2
the sailor 's sentence was cut short by a new tinkle of the bell .,1
"harding could not help smiling , and the sailor 's idea was adopted .",8
"jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive glance of some stranger . he had that dislike of being stared at , which comes on geniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace . sibyl , however , was quite unconscious of the effect she was producing . her love was trembling in laughter on her lips . she was thinking of prince charming , and , that she might think of him all the more , she did not talk of him , but prattled on about the ship in which jim was going to sail , about the gold he was certain to find , about the wonderful heiress whose life he was to save from the wicked , red - shirted bushrangers . for he was not to remain a sailor , or a supercargo , or whatever he was going to be . oh , no ! a sailor 's existence was dreadful . fancy being cooped up in a horrid ship , with the hoarse , hump - backed waves trying to get in , and a black wind blowing the masts down and tearing the sails into long screaming ribands !",137

"as he was saying these words , the door opened . a steward entered . he brought us some clothes , jackets and sailor 's pants , made out of a fabric whose nature i did n't recognize . i hurried to change into them , and my companions followed suit .",23
""" what will be the good of that ? "" thought the sailor .",12
"and , at this moment , as if to bear witness to the truth of the sailor 's words , two or three quadrumana showed themselves at the windows , from which they had pushed back the shutters , and saluted the real proprietors of the place with a thousand hideous grimaces .",16
"and , while thus speaking , the sailor never left the glass .",7
""" but we must drive these vagabonds out somehow , "" cried the sailor .",13
""" oh ! "" shouted the sailor , "" and i never thought of that . """,6
"the honest sailor did not hide his regret at being reduced for dinner to the singing pheasants , but fortune once more showed itself obliging to him .",2
"had these pirates -- for the sailors of the brig could be nothing else -- already visited the island , since on approaching it they had hoisted their colors .",6
""" you 're right , professor aronnax , "" he told me . "" if i ca n't take the sun 's altitude tomorrow , i wo n't be able to try again for another six months . but precisely because sailors ' luck has led me into these seas on march 21 , it will be easy to get our bearings if the noonday sun does appear before our eyes . """,41
"as if in reply to the sailor 's observation , a bright light flashed in the darkness , and a cannon - shot was heard .",6
"the fire was lighted , and neb and pencroft , on whom the functions of cooks naturally devolved , to the one in his quality of negro , to the other in that of sailor , quickly prepared some broiled agouti , to which they did great justice .",34
two hurrahs from the sailor was the reply .,4
there were drying several pairs of sailors ' trousers .,6
"what ayrton felt when he overheard this fragment of conversation may be understood when it is known that in this bob harvey he recognized one of his old australian companions , a daring sailor , who had continued his criminal career .",33
"on this day , the engineer , seeing a plant belonging to the wormwood genus , the principal species of which are absinthe , balm - mint , tarragon , etc . , gathered several tufts , and , presenting them to the sailor , said,--",43
""" do n’t be afraid . i am a sailor . """,9
"there they talked , they instructed each other , they made plans , and the rough good - humor of the sailor always amused this little world , in which the most perfect harmony had never ceased to reign .",21
"he brushed their clothes , he turned the spit , he waited at table , he swept the rooms , he gathered wood , and he performed another admirable piece of service which delighted pencroft -- he never went to sleep without first coming to tuck up the worthy sailor in his bed .",49
"and without waiting for a reply to this proposal , knowing that it would be approved of , the sailor and neb detached a quantity of the molluscs .",19
""" what you say is true , my boy , "" replied the sailor .",13
""" i would rather be here than in the hands of the southerners , "" cried the sailor , "" especially since the captain has been kind enough to come and join us again . """,17
"the next day , the 17th of april , the sailor 's first words were addressed to gideon spilett .",10
"at that moment , cyrus harding , ayrton , the sailor , and herbert , were rejoined by neb and gideon spilett .",10
all at once the tall figure of the sailor appeared .,8
"cyrus harding and neb were taken into confidence , and the sailor suspected nothing during the whole time , necessarily somewhat long , which was required in order to dry the small leaves , chop them up , and subject them to a certain torrefaction on hot stones .",11
"and pencroft returned to his work , not without uttering a sigh of regret , for every sailor is a born fisherman , and if the pleasure of fishing is in exact proportion to the size of the animal , one can judge how a whaler feels in sight of a whale .",17
"all at once he started . his eyes became fixed upon a point of the sea , commanded by the terrace where he was . with the eagle glance of a sailor he had recognized there , where another would have seen only a gull hovering over the waves , the sail of a sloop which was directed toward the cost of france .",31
"pencroft had formerly served on board a whaling - ship , and he could methodically direct the operation of cutting up , a sufficiently disagreeable operation lasting three days , but from which the settlers did not flinch , not even gideon spilett , who , as the sailor said , would end by making a "" real good castaway . """,48
""" yes ! yes ! "" replied the sailor , "" but that is not the question .",8
"but the engineer did not reply to the sailor except by proposing to examine the cliff more attentively , from the mouth of the river to the angle which terminated it on the north .",8
and it must be confessed that the sailor 's arguments were reasonable .,7
""" at any rate , "" observed gideon spilett to the sailor , "" the explosion , if there has been one , has produced singular effects !",11
"the sailor endeavored to speak , but could not get out a word ; so , seizing the pipe , he carried it to his lips , then applying the coal , he drew five or six great whiffs .",1
""" well , my friends , i will repay you some day , "" replied the sailor .",16
"the reporter and the sailor talked with him , and he could not conceal his astonishment .",4
""" it may be so , "" said the obstinate sailor ; "" but as to a rock , there is not one in the channel ! """,10
"and every moment burst forth the hurrahs of the delighted sailor when he caught sight of the barrels of gunpowder , firearms and sidearms , balls of cotton , implements of husbandry , carpenter 's , joiner 's , and blacksmith 's tools , and boxes of all kinds of seeds , not in the least injured by their short sojourn in the water .",10
""" pencroft , "" replied the engineer , placing his hand on the sailor 's shoulder , "" if any misfortune happens to you , or to this lad , whom chance has made our child , do you think we could ever cease to blame ourselves ? """,13
"the drowsy sailor leaped to his feet as she spoke , and looked wildly round . the sound of the shutting of the hall door fell on his ear . he rushed out as if in pursuit .",2
"sailors ' luck led the nautilus straight to reao island , one of the most unusual in this group , which was discovered in 1822 by captain bell aboard the minerva . so i was able to study the madreporic process that has created the islands in this ocean .",0
""" that 's evident , "" replied the sailor , "" and there can be no other explanation to give . quiet there , top ! "" added pencroft , turning to the dog , "" and you , jup , be off to your room ! """,8
"they look like shipwrecked sailors who have not eaten for six weeks . """,4
""" pencroft , think of ayrton ! "" said herbert , taking the sailor 's hand .",13
"the next day he did not leave the house , and , indeed , spent most of the time in his own room , sick with a wild terror of dying , and yet indifferent to life itself . the consciousness of being hunted , snared , tracked down , had begun to dominate him . if the tapestry did but tremble in the wind , he shook . the dead leaves that were blown against the leaded panes seemed to him like his own wasted resolutions and wild regrets . when he closed his eyes , he saw again the sailor 's face peering through the mist- stained glass , and horror seemed once more to lay its hand upon his heart .",101
"not one of the former colonists of lincoln island was absent , for they had sworn to live always together . neb was with his master ; ayrton was there ready to sacrifice himself for all ; pencroft was more a farmer than he had ever been a sailor ; herbert , who completed his studies under the superintendence of cyrus harding , and gideon spilett , who founded the new lincoln herald , the best - informed journal in the world .",48
"the courageous boy knew of the sailor 's plan , and it was not without anxiety that he awaited the result of the proposal being made to the engineer .",6
""" it is becoming more and more interesting , "" murmured gideon spilett in the sailor 's ear , who nodded .",15
"but from this day master jup had a pipe of his own , the sailor 's ex - pipe , which was hung in his room near his store of tobacco .",14
it may readily be understood that this similarity of tastes of jup and pencroft served to tighten the bonds of friendship which already existed between the honest ape and the worthy sailor .,31
""" yes , sir . he looks as if he had been a sort of sailor ; tattooed on both arms , and that kind of thing . """,15
"the sailor thought he recognized gulls and cormorants , whose shrill cries rose above the roaring of the sea .",1
"cyrus harding was equally anxious to try the vessel , the model of which had originated with him , although on the sailor 's advice he had altered some parts of it , but he did not share pencroft 's confidence in her , and as the latter had not again spoken of the voyage to tabor island , harding hoped he had given it up .",22
""" here , "" replied the engineer , showing the sturdy sailor a considerable recess in the side , which would much diminish the thickness .",11
"the sailor was right ; they had been thrown , not on a continent , not even on an island , but on an islet which was not more than two miles in length , with even a less breadth .",1
"however , pencroft , accustomed with his sailor eyes to piece through the gloom , was almost certain that he could clearly distinguish in the west confused masses which indicated an elevated coast .",7
"the anabaptist , being upon deck , lent a helping hand as well as the rest , when a brutish sailor gave him a blow and laid him speechless ; but , not withstanding , with the violence of the blow the tar himself tumbled headforemost overboard , and fell upon a piece of the broken mast , which he immediately grasped .",20
"the obstinate sailor did not reply , and let the conversation drop , quite determined to resume it again .",2
"the sailor nodded ; besides , his eyes could not deceive him .",1
"that evil influence which carried me first away from my father ’s house — which hurried me into the wild and indigested notion of raising my fortune , and that impressed those conceits so forcibly upon me as to make me deaf to all good advice , and to the entreaties and even the commands of my father — i say , the same influence , whatever it was , presented the most unfortunate of all enterprises to my view ; and i went on board a vessel bound to the coast of africa ; or , as our sailors vulgarly called it , a voyage to guinea .",99
"this was the only voyage which i may say was successful in all my adventures , which i owe to the integrity and honesty of my friend the captain ; under whom also i got a competent knowledge of the mathematics and the rules of navigation , learned how to keep an account of the ship ’s course , take an observation , and , in short , to understand some things that were needful to be understood by a sailor ; for , as he took delight to instruct me , i took delight to learn ; and , in a word , this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant ; for i brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold - dust for my adventure , which yielded me in london , at my return , almost £ 300 ; and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts which have since so completed my ruin .",80

"the sailor trusted herbert as he would himself , and his confidence was justified by the coolness and judgment of the lad .",1
"on seeing herbert senseless , the sailor 's grief was terrible .",6
"they were light and active , and pencroft , as a sailor , accustomed to run up the masts and shrouds , was able to give them lessons .",11
""" here are mussels ! "" cried the sailor ; "" these will do instead of eggs ! """,8
"the sailor could rely upon herbert ; the young boy was well up in natural history , and always had had quite a passion for the science .",1
"however , the sailor thought that by stopping - up some of the openings with a mixture of stones and sand , the chimneys could be rendered habitable .",3
""" so we can , my boy , "" replied the sailor , "" and these chimneys will serve our turn .",11
the sailor then struck a light and set fire to a twig .,1
herbert and the sailor began their ascent ; thanks to the vigor of their muscles they reached the summit in a few minutes ; and proceeded to the point above the mouth of the river .,3
how long the night appeared to the sailor and his companions !,7
"herbert , not attaching much importance to his discovery , was going to throw away the grain in question ; but harding took it , examined it , found that it was in good condition , and looking the sailor full in the face--""pencroft , "" he asked quietly , "" do you know how many ears one grain of corn can produce ? """,39
at any rate the sailor was not sorry to go to breakfast on board .,4
"a few dozen being collected , were packed in the sailor 's handkerchief , and as the time when the tide would be full was approaching , pencroft and herbert began to redescend towards the watercourse .",10
and the sailor and spilett immediately ran at full speed towards the spot from whence the cries proceeded .,2
"the prisoner remained quiet in the fore - cabin , and as he had been a sailor it appeared that the motion of the vessel might produce on him a salutary reaction .",16
"on this occasion pencroft and his companions , who were occupied with loosing themselves , received unexpected aid from the prisoner , who emerged from the hatchway as if his sailor 's instinct had suddenly returned , broke a piece out of the bulwarks with a spar so as to let the water which filled the deck escape . then the vessel being clear , he descended to his cabin without having uttered a word .",30
"the officer conversed a few instants with the captain , gave him several papers , of which he was the bearer , to read , and upon the order of the merchant captain the whole crew of the vessel , both passengers and sailors , were called upon deck .",43
""" pencroft , "" said harding , taking the sailor 's arm , "" that is a wicked idea of yours , and you will distress me much if you persist in speaking thus .",9
"herbert then in a few words related the incidents of the voyage , and dwelt on the curious fact of the sort of passing gleam in the prisoner 's mind , when for an instant in the height of the storm he had become a sailor .",45
"according to the sailor , any animal , whatever it was , would be a lawful prize , and the rodents or carnivora which might get into the new snares would be well received at granite house .",3
"as to the sailor , he passed the night with one eye on the fire , on which he did not spare fuel .",3
"the sailor having strung the couroucous like larks on flexible twigs , they then continued their exploration .",1
"after several fruitless attempts , which resulted in nothing but scaring the grouse , the sailor said to the lad,--",15
""" like a fish , "" replied the sailor quite seriously .",8
"oh , be assured , if the memory of my brother were not sacred to me , you should rot in a state dungeon or satisfy the curiosity of sailors at tyburn . i will be silent , but you must endure your captivity quietly .",29
"but the obstinate sailor would listen to nothing of this , and he would give the engineer no peace till he promised to satisfy his desire .",3
"gideon spilett approved of the sailor 's opinion that it was best not to divide , and herbert was obliged to give up his project ; but two large tears fell from his eyes .",5
"the sailor 's reasoning was very just , and pointed out an incomprehensible fact , for the document appeared to have been recently written , when the colonists found it in the bottle .",1
"moreover , it gave the latitude and longitude of tabor island correctly , which implied that its author had a more complete knowledge of hydrography than could be expected of a common sailor .",32
"their meal concluded , each retired to the corner in which he had rested the preceding night , and herbert was not long in going to sleep near the sailor , who had stretched himself beside the fireplace .",29
""" well ! "" said the reporter , pressing the sailor 's hand .",10
"the poor negro , absorbed in his grief , evidently had neither seen his companions nor heard the sailor speak .",18
""" then you did n't turn it over enough ! "" returned the obstinate sailor .",14
""" the masters of the island ! "" exclaimed the sailor ; "" the masters of the island ! ... "" he repeated , and his voice was choked , as if his throat was seized in an iron grasp .",10
"on the way the sailor could not help repeating,--",4
""" you are right , captain , and i was wrong , as usual , "" replied the sailor .",18
""" in a few minutes it will be quite dark , "" whispered spilett in the sailor 's ear , "" then will be the time to act . """,16
"the two great barrels , hermetically sealed , but which sounded hollow and empty , were fastened to its sides by strong ropes , knotted with a skill which pencroft directly pronounced sailors alone could exhibit .",32
"this accident , which appeared so very serious to pencroft , produced different effects on the companions of the honest sailor .",20
herbert shared in some degree the sailor 's feelings .,6
no one could help laughing at this speech of the sailor 's .,10
