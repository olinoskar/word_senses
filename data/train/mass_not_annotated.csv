"there , in place of natural wonders , the watery mass offered some thrilling and dreadful scenes to my eyes . in essence , we were then crossing that part of the whole mediterranean so fertile in casualties . from the coast of algiers to the beaches of provence , how many ships have wrecked , how many vessels have vanished ! compared to the vast liquid plains of the pacific , the mediterranean is a mere lake , but it 's an unpredictable lake with fickle waves , today kindly and affectionate to those frail single - masters drifting between a double ultramarine of sky and water , tomorrow bad - tempered and turbulent , agitated by the winds , demolishing the strongest ships beneath sudden waves that smash down with a headlong wallop .",10
there was no fear of damp in the middle of that thick mass of granite .,12
""" no , "" i said , "" no ; it is not through such a mass that a voice can be heard . i am surrounded by granite walls , and the loudest explosion could never be heard here ! this noise comes along the gallery . there must be here some remarkable exercise of acoustic laws ! """,16
captain nemo gave me an odd look and gestured no . which told me pretty clearly that nothing would ever force him to set foot on a land mass again . then he said :,28
at six we were afoot . the moment drew near to clear a way by blasting through the opposing mass of granite .,19
"d’artagnan had just passed the rue cassette , and already perceived the door of his friend ’s house , shaded by a mass of sycamores and clematis which formed a vast arch opposite the front of it , when he perceived something like a shadow issuing from the rue servandoni .",22
"but what happened to the nautilus ? did it withstand the maelstrom 's clutches ? is captain nemo alive ? is he still under the ocean pursuing his frightful program of revenge , or did he stop after that latest mass execution ? will the waves someday deliver that manuscript that contains his full life story ? will i finally learn the man 's name ? will the nationality of the stricken warship tell us the nationality of captain nemo ?",40
"i looked back down the side we had just cleared . there the mountain rose only 700 to 800 feet above the plains ; but on its far slope it crowned the receding bottom of this part of the atlantic by a height twice that . my eyes scanned the distance and took in a vast area lit by intense flashes of light . in essence , this mountain was a volcano . fifty feet below its peak , amid a shower of stones and slag , a wide crater vomited torrents of lava that were dispersed in fiery cascades into the heart of the liquid mass . so situated , this volcano was an immense torch that lit up the lower plains all the way to the horizon .",106
"near seven o'clock we finally surveyed the bank of shellfish , where pearl oysters reproduce by the millions . these valuable mollusks stick to rocks , where they 're strongly attached by a mass of brown filaments that forbids their moving about . in this respect oysters are inferior even to mussels , to whom nature has not denied all talent for locomotion .",33
"i approached this phenomenal mollusk . its mass of filaments attached it to a table of granite , and there it grew by itself in the midst of the cave 's calm waters . i estimated the weight of this giant clam at 300 kilograms . hence such an oyster held fifteen kilos of meat , and you 'd need the stomach of king gargantua to eat a couple dozen .",7
"i slipped out of the room , unobserved by any eye -- for the company were gathered in one mass about the trembling trio just returned -- and i closed the door quietly behind me .",19
"work began immediately and was carried on with tireless tenacity . instead of digging all around the nautilus , which would have entailed even greater difficulties , captain nemo had an immense trench outlined on the ice , eight meters from our port quarter . then his men simultaneously staked it off at several points around its circumference . soon their picks were vigorously attacking this compact matter , and huge chunks were loosened from its mass . these chunks weighed less than the water , and by an unusual effect of specific gravity , each chunk took wing , as it were , to the roof of the tunnel , which thickened above by as much as it diminished below . but this hardly mattered so long as the lower surface kept growing thinner .",76
"nothing else until the moment when , through a rift in the clouds , i saw the daring captain clinging to one of the animal 's fins , fighting the monster at close quarters , belaboring his enemy 's belly with stabs of the dagger yet unable to deliver the deciding thrust , in other words , a direct hit to the heart . in its struggles the man - eater churned the watery mass so furiously , its eddies threatened to knock me over .",74
""" but , "" said i , "" the clothes , and that mass of ladders and ropes , what is to become of them ? """,13
"while i was contemplating this inert mass , suddenly a dozen of these voracious melanoptera appeared around our longboat ; but , paying no attention to us , they pounced on the corpse and quarreled over every scrap of it .",6
""" why not ? are not all bodies subject throughout their mass to the power of universal attraction ? this mass of water can not escape the general law . and in spite of the heavy atmospheric pressure on the surface , you will see it rise like the atlantic itself . """,11
she alone had hollowed this fairy alhambra in a mass of granite .,9
by mid - day there was a change in the appearance of this wall of the gallery . i noticed it by a diminution of the amount of light reflected from the sides ; solid rock was appearing in the place of the lava coating . the mass was composed of inclined and sometimes vertical strata . we were passing through rocks of the transition or silurian [ 1 ] system .,47
"the sea , the sky , the land were all mingled in one black mass .",14
"all the colonists , their services thus requisitioned by pencroft , descended to the dockyard , and proceeded to place the keelson , a thick mass of wood which forms the lower portion of a ship and unites firmly the timbers of the hull .",25
"this cavern was about a hundred feet wide and a hundred and fifty in height . a large mass had been rent asunder by a subterranean disturbance . yielding to some vast power from below it had broken asunder , leaving this great hollow into which human beings were now penetrating for the first time .",18
"just at this moment there was an unusual stir in the human mass . all the hands were raised in the air . some , tightly closed , seemed to disappear suddenly in the midst of the cries -- an energetic way , no doubt , of casting a vote . the crowd swayed back , the banners and flags wavered , disappeared an instant , then reappeared in tatters . the undulations of the human surge reached the steps , while all the heads floundered on the surface like a sea agitated by a squall . many of the black hats disappeared , and the greater part of the crowd seemed to have diminished in height .",12
""" actually he 's right , "" i said . "" i 've heard about that picture . but the subject it portrays is taken from a legend , and you know how to rate legends in matters of natural history ! besides , when it 's an issue of monsters , the human imagination always tends to run wild . people not only claimed these devilfish could drag ships under , but a certain olaus magnus tells of a cephalopod a mile long that looked more like an island than an animal . there 's also the story of how the bishop of trondheim set up an altar one day on an immense rock . after he finished saying mass , this rock started moving and went back into the sea . the rock was a devilfish . """,120
"the cliff , as has been said , rose to a height of three hundred feet , but the mass was unbroken throughout , and even at its base , scarcely washed by the sea , it did not offer the smallest fissure which would serve as a dwelling .",19
"it was a squid of colossal dimensions , fully eight meters long . it was traveling backward with tremendous speed in the same direction as the nautilus . it gazed with enormous , staring eyes that were tinted sea green . its eight arms ( or more accurately , feet ) were rooted in its head , which has earned these animals the name cephalopod ; its arms stretched a distance twice the length of its body and were writhing like the serpentine hair of the furies . you could plainly see its 250 suckers , arranged over the inner sides of its tentacles and shaped like semispheric capsules . sometimes these suckers fastened onto the lounge window by creating vacuums against it . the monster 's mouth -- a beak made of horn and shaped like that of a parrot -- opened and closed vertically . its tongue , also of horn substance and armed with several rows of sharp teeth , would flicker out from between these genuine shears . what a freak of nature ! a bird 's beak on a mollusk ! its body was spindle - shaped and swollen in the middle , a fleshy mass that must have weighed 20,000 to 25,000 kilograms . its unstable color would change with tremendous speed as the animal grew irritated , passing successively from bluish gray to reddish brown .",200
"having breakfasted , mr . fogg and his companions resumed their places in the car , and observed the varied landscape which unfolded itself as they passed along the vast prairies , the mountains lining the horizon , and the creeks , with their frothy , foaming streams . sometimes a great herd of buffaloes , massing together in the distance , seemed like a moveable dam . these innumerable multitudes of ruminating beasts often form an insurmountable obstacle to the passage of the trains ; thousands of them have been seen passing over the track for hours together , in compact ranks . the locomotive is then forced to stop and wait till the road is once more clear .",56
"the two arms fell with a sudden force ; they heard the hissing of the scimitar and the cry of the victim , then a truncated mass sank beneath the blow .",26
"this homeric slaughter dragged on for an hour , and the long - skulled predators could n't get away . several times ten or twelve of them teamed up , trying to crush the nautilus with their sheer mass . through the windows you could see their enormous mouths paved with teeth , their fearsome eyes . losing all self - control , ned land hurled threats and insults at them . you could feel them clinging to the submersible like hounds atop a wild boar in the underbrush . but by forcing the pace of its propeller , the nautilus carried them off , dragged them under , or brought them back to the upper level of the waters , untroubled by their enormous weight or their powerful grip .",38
"when in its early stages the earth was slowly cooling , its contraction gave rise in its crust to disruptions , distortions , fissures , and chasms . the passage through which we were moving was such a fissure , through which at one time granite poured out in a molten state . its thousands of windings formed an inextricable labyrinth through the primeval mass .",64
"in fact , the catalan method , properly so called , requires the construction of kilns and crucibles , in which the ore and the coal , placed in alternate layers , are transformed and reduced , but cyrus harding intended to economize these constructions , and wished simply to form , with the ore and the coal , a cubic mass , to the center of which he would direct the wind from his bellows .",61
"the whole consciousness of my life lorn , my love lost , my hope quenched , my faith death - struck , swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass .",31
"this was the wisest course , and it was about to be followed when herbert , pointing to a confused mass among the trees , exclaimed,--",20
"captain nemo walked in front , and his companion followed us a few steps to the rear . conseil and i stayed next to each other , as if daydreaming that through our metal carapaces , a little polite conversation might still be possible ! already i no longer felt the bulkiness of my clothes , footwear , and air tank , nor the weight of the heavy sphere inside which my head was rattling like an almond in its shell . once immersed in water , all these objects lost a part of their weight equal to the weight of the liquid they displaced , and thanks to this law of physics discovered by archimedes , i did just fine . i was no longer an inert mass , and i had , comparatively speaking , great freedom of movement .",128
""" that is true , cyrus , "" replied the reporter , "" but we have already examined all that mass of granite , and there is not a hole , not a cranny ! """,20
"the fire broke out at dead of night , and before the engines arrived from millcote , the building was one mass of flame .",21
"it was a horrible wound . the cranium had been smashed open by some blunt instrument , leaving the naked brains exposed , and the cerebral matter had suffered deep abrasions . blood clots had formed in this dissolving mass , taking on the color of wine dregs . both contusion and concussion of the brain had occurred . the sick man 's breathing was labored , and muscle spasms quivered in his face . cerebral inflammation was complete and had brought on a paralysis of movement and sensation .",39
""" he has just come from mass and is at the parade , "" replied the sergeant , "" and in about three hours ' time you may possibly have the honor to kiss his spurs . """,6
"so i did n't allude to this event when , that evening , i chanced to be alone with the captain in the lounge . besides , he seemed silent and preoccupied . then , contrary to custom , he ordered that both panels in the lounge be opened , and going from the one to the other , he carefully observed the watery mass . for what purpose ? i had n't a guess , and for my part , i spent my time studying the fish that passed before my eyes .",64
"in an hour we had reached the islet . two hours later we had completed a full circle around it . it measured four to five miles in circumference . a narrow channel separated it from a considerable shore , perhaps a continent whose limits we could n't see . the existence of this shore seemed to bear out commander maury 's hypotheses . in essence , this ingenious american has noted that between the south pole and the 60th parallel , the sea is covered with floating ice of dimensions much greater than any found in the north atlantic . from this fact he drew the conclusion that the antarctic circle must contain considerable shores , since icebergs ca n't form on the high seas but only along coastlines . according to his calculations , this frozen mass enclosing the southernmost pole forms a vast ice cap whose width must reach 4,000 kilometers .",138
"above the new crater a cloud of smoke and ashes , mingled with those of the atmosphere , massed over the island .",18
a mass execution,1
"in the midst of the watery mass , brightly lit by our electric beams , there snaked past those one - meter lampreys that are common to nearly every clime . a type of ray from the genus oxyrhynchus , five feet wide , had a white belly with a spotted , ash - gray back and was carried along by the currents like a huge , wide - open shawl . other rays passed by so quickly i could n't tell if they deserved that name "" eagle ray "" coined by the ancient greeks , or those designations of "" rat ray , "" "" bat ray , "" and "" toad ray "" that modern fishermen have inflicted on them . dogfish known as topes , twelve feet long and especially feared by divers , were racing with each other . looking like big bluish shadows , thresher sharks went by , eight feet long and gifted with an extremely acute sense of smell . dorados from the genus sparus , some measuring up to thirteen decimeters , appeared in silver and azure costumes encircled with ribbons , which contrasted with the dark color of their fins ; fish sacred to the goddess venus , their eyes set in brows of gold ; a valuable species that patronizes all waters fresh or salt , equally at home in rivers , lakes , and oceans , living in every clime , tolerating any temperature , their line dating back to prehistoric times on this earth yet preserving all its beauty from those far - off days . magnificent sturgeons , nine to ten meters long and extremely fast , banged their powerful tails against the glass of our panels , showing bluish backs with small brown spots ; they resemble sharks , without equaling their strength , and are encountered in every sea ; in the spring they delight in swimming up the great rivers , fighting the currents of the volga , danube , po , rhine , loire , and oder , while feeding on herring , mackerel , salmon , and codfish ; although they belong to the class of cartilaginous fish , they rate as a delicacy ; they 're eaten fresh , dried , marinated , or salt - preserved , and in olden times they were borne in triumph to the table of the roman epicure lucullus . but whenever the nautilus drew near the surface , those denizens of the mediterranean i could observe most productively belonged to the sixty - third genus of bony fish . these were tuna from the genus scomber , blue - black on top , silver on the belly armor , their dorsal stripes giving off a golden gleam . they are said to follow ships in search of refreshing shade from the hot tropical sun , and they did just that with the nautilus , as they had once done with the vessels of the count de la pérouse . for long hours they competed in speed with our submersible . i could n't stop marveling at these animals so perfectly cut out for racing , their heads small , their bodies sleek , spindle - shaped , and in some cases over three meters long , their pectoral fins gifted with remarkable strength , their caudal fins forked . like certain flocks of birds , whose speed they equal , these tuna swim in triangle formation , which prompted the ancients to say they 'd boned up on geometry and military strategy . and yet they ca n't escape the provençal fishermen , who prize them as highly as did the ancient inhabitants of turkey and italy ; and these valuable animals , as oblivious as if they were deaf and blind , leap right into the marseilles tuna nets and perish by the thousands .",6
