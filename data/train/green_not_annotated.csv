"and besides , my dear old basil , if you really want to console me , teach me rather to forget what has happened , or to see it from a proper artistic point of view . was it not gautier who used to write about la consolation des arts ? i remember picking up a little vellum - covered book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase . well , i am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at marlow together , the young man who used to say that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life . i love beautiful things that one can touch and handle . old brocades , green bronzes , lacquer - work , carved ivories , exquisite surroundings , luxury , pomp -- there is much to be got from all these . but the artistic temperament that they create , or at any rate reveal , is still more to me .",128
"what rage then drove us against these monsters ! we lost all self - control . ten or twelve devilfish had overrun the nautilus 's platform and sides . we piled helter - skelter into the thick of these sawed - off snakes , which darted over the platform amid waves of blood and sepia ink . it seemed as if these viscous tentacles grew back like the many heads of hydra . at every thrust ned land 's harpoon would plunge into a squid 's sea - green eye and burst it . but my daring companion was suddenly toppled by the tentacles of a monster he could not avoid .",88
"and if nothing happens without his knowledge , he knows that i am here , and am in this dreadful condition ; and if nothing happens without his appointment , he has appointed all this to befall me . nothing occurred to my thought to contradict any of these conclusions , and therefore it rested upon me with the greater force , that it must needs be that god had appointed all this to befall me ; that i was brought into this miserable circumstance by his direction , he having the sole power , not of me only , but of everything that happened in the world . immediately it followed : why has god done this to me ? what have i done to be thus used ? my conscience presently checked me in that inquiry , as if i had blasphemed , and methought it spoke to me like a voice : “ wretch ! dost _ thou _ ask what thou hast done ? look back upon a dreadful misspent life , and ask thyself what thou hast _ not _ done ? ask , why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed ? why wert thou not drowned in yarmouth roads ; killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the sallee man - of - war ; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of africa ; or drowned _ here _ , when all the crew perished but thyself ? dost _ thou _ ask , what have i done ? ” i was struck dumb with these reflections , as one astonished , and had not a word to say — no , not to answer to myself , but rose up pensive and sad , walked back to my retreat , and went up over my wall , as if i had been going to bed ; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed , and i had no inclination to sleep ; so i sat down in my chair , and lighted my lamp , for it began to be dark . now , as the apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me very much , it occurred to my thought that the brazilians take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers , and i had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests , which was quite cured , and some also that was green , and not quite cured .",417
"our two inhabitants of the other hemisphere amused themselves greatly with what they saw . the quoits were large , round pieces , yellow , red , and green , which cast a most glorious luster . our travelers picked some of them up , and they proved to be gold , emeralds , rubies , and diamonds ; the least of which would have been the greatest ornament to the superb throne of the great mogul .",28
"indeed , larger blocks of ice soon appeared , their brilliance varying at the whim of the mists . some of these masses displayed green veins , as if scrawled with undulating lines of copper sulfate . others looked like enormous amethysts , letting the light penetrate their insides . the latter reflected the sun 's rays from the thousand facets of their crystals . the former , tinted with a bright limestone sheen , would have supplied enough building material to make a whole marble town .",24
""" it is a wonderful place , the moor , "" said he , looking round over the undulating downs , long green rollers , with crests of jagged granite foaming up into fantastic surges . "" you never tire of the moor . you can not think the wonderful secrets which it contains . it is so vast , and so barren , and so mysterious . """,22
"something brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges . then a long , agonized , writhing neck shot upward and a dreadful cry echoed over the moor . it turned me cold with horror , but my companion 's nerves seemed to be stronger than mine .",8
"i remember something , too , of the green grave - mounds ; and i have not forgotten , either , two figures of strangers straying amongst the low hillocks and reading the mementoes graven on the few mossy head - stones .",8
"just then the gulf stream 's speed was 2.25 meters per second . so distinct is its current from the surrounding sea , its confined waters stand out against the ocean and operate on a different level from the colder waters . murky as well , and very rich in saline material , their pure indigo contrasts with the green waves surrounding them . moreover , their line of demarcation is so clear that abreast of the carolinas , the nautilus 's spur cut the waves of the gulf stream while its propeller was still churning those belonging to the ocean .",59
"on leaving rejkiavik hans took us by the seashore . we passed lean pastures which were trying very hard , but in vain , to look green ; yellow came out best . the rugged peaks of the trachyte rocks presented faint outlines on the eastern horizon ; at times a few patches of snow , concentrating the vague light , glittered upon the slopes of the distant mountains ; certain peaks , boldly uprising , passed through the grey clouds , and reappeared above the moving mists , like breakers emerging in the heavens .",26
"after clearing the outer belt of rocks via a narrow passageway , the nautilus lay inside the breakers where the sea had a depth of thirty to forty fathoms . under the green shade of some tropical evergreens , i spotted a few savages who looked extremely startled at our approach . in this long , blackish object advancing flush with the water , did n't they see some fearsome cetacean that they were obliged to view with distrust ?",32
"in the midst of this moving vegetation , under arbors of water plants , there raced legions of clumsy articulates , in particular some fanged frog crabs whose carapaces form a slightly rounded triangle , robber crabs exclusive to these waterways , and horrible parthenope crabs whose appearance was repulsive to the eye . one animal no less hideous , which i encountered several times , was the enormous crab that mr . darwin observed , to which nature has given the instinct and requisite strength to eat coconuts ; it scrambles up trees on the beach and sends the coconuts tumbling ; they fracture in their fall and are opened by its powerful pincers . here , under these clear waves , this crab raced around with matchless agility , while green turtles from the species frequenting the malabar coast moved sluggishly among the crumbling rocks .",132
"then came a new development . i had drawn you as paris in dainty armour , and as adonis with huntsman 's cloak and polished boar- spear . crowned with heavy lotus - blossoms you had sat on the prow of adrian 's barge , gazing across the green turbid nile . you had leaned over the still pool of some greek woodland and seen in the water 's silent silver the marvel of your own face . and it had all been what art should be -- unconscious , ideal , and remote . one day , a fatal day i sometimes think , i determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are , not in the costume of dead ages , but in your own dress and in your own time . whether it was the realism of the method , or the mere wonder of your own personality , thus directly presented to me without mist or veil , i can not tell . but i know that as i worked at it , every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret .",48
i led him out of the wet and wild wood into some cheerful fields : i described to him how brilliantly green they were ; how the flowers and hedges looked refreshed ; how sparklingly blue was the sky .,21
"its fishing finished , the nautilus drew nearer to the coast . in this locality a number of sea turtles were sleeping on the surface of the waves . it would have been difficult to capture these valuable reptiles , because they wake up at the slightest sound , and their solid carapaces are harpoon - proof . but our suckerfish would effect their capture with extraordinary certainty and precision . in truth , this animal is a living fishhook , promising wealth and happiness to the greenest fisherman in the business .",87
""" you are no ruin , sir -- no lightning - struck tree : you are green and vigorous .",16
"there was a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy , and the blue cloud - shadows chased themselves across the grass like swallows . how pleasant it was in the garden ! and how delightful other people 's emotions were!-- much more delightful than their ideas , it seemed to him . one 's own soul , and the passions of one 's friends -- those were the fascinating things in life . he pictured to himself with silent amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long with basil hallward .",9
"in this way we caught several loggerheads , reptiles a meter wide and weighing 200 kilos . they 're extremely valuable because of their carapaces , which are covered with big slabs of horn , thin , brown , transparent , with white and yellow markings . besides , they were excellent from an edible viewpoint , with an exquisite flavor comparable to the green turtle .",64
"their size exceeded that of a rabbit , their hair was yellow , mingled with green spots , and they had the merest rudiments of tails .",15
"neb and herbert ran to the edge of the lake , shaded with pines and other green trees , and soon returned with some branches , which they made into torches .",16
"i looked round , with a chill of fear in my heart , at the huge swelling plain , mottled with the green patches of rushes . nothing stirred over the vast expanse save a pair of ravens , which croaked loudly from a tor behind us .",22
"( i had green eyes , reader ; but you must excuse the mistake : for him they were new - dyed , i suppose . )",3
"in three hours i had seen not only the town but its environs . the general aspect was wonderfully dull . no trees , and scarcely any vegetation . everywhere bare rocks , signs of volcanic action . the icelandic huts are made of earth and turf , and the walls slope inward ; they rather resemble roofs placed on the ground . but then these roofs are meadows of comparative fertility . thanks to the internal heat , the grass grows on them to some degree of perfection . it is carefully mown in the hay season ; if it were not , the horses would come to pasture on these green abodes .",112
"a long line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips , and of yellow and red roses , defiled in front of him , threading their way through the huge , jade - green piles of vegetables . under the portico , with its grey , sun - bleached pillars , loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls , waiting for the auction to be over . others crowded round the swinging doors of the coffee - house in the piazza . the heavy cart - horses slipped and stamped upon the rough stones , shaking their bells and trappings . some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks . iris - necked and pink - footed , the pigeons ran about picking up seeds .",33
"a small fly or moth had fluttered across our path , and in an instant stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it . to my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire , and my acquaintance never paused for an instant , bounding from tuft to tuft behind it , his green net waving in the air . his gray clothes and jerky , zigzag , irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself . i was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the treacherous mire , when i heard the sound of steps , and turning round found a woman near me upon the path . she had come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of merripit house , but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close .",58
"from its first declivities to within two miles of the coast were spread vast masses of wood , relieved by large green patches , caused by the presence of evergreen trees .",21
"we stayed there nearly a week : i and sophie used to walk every day in a great green place full of trees , called the park ; and there were many children there besides me , and a pond with beautiful birds in it , that i fed with crumbs . """,18
"a shot brought it to the ground , and top carried it to the canoe . at the same time half a dozen lories were brought down . the lory is of the size of a pigeon , the plumage dashed with green , part of the wings crimson , and its crest bordered with white .",42
""" i mean to say that when i came in , although i had the key of your apartment in my pocket , and that key had never quit me , i found a letter on the green table cover in your bedroom . """,37
"the vessel was two miles off . it drew nearer , always moving toward the phosphorescent glow that signaled the nautilus 's presence . i saw its green and red running lights , plus the white lantern hanging from the large stay of its foremast . hazy flickerings were reflected on its rigging and indicated that its furnaces were pushed to the limit . showers of sparks and cinders of flaming coal escaped from its funnels , spangling the air with stars .",27
"for two hours a whole aquatic army escorted the nautilus . in the midst of their leaping and cavorting , while they competed with each other in beauty , radiance , and speed , i could distinguish some green wrasse , bewhiskered mullet marked with pairs of black lines , white gobies from the genus eleotris with curved caudal fins and violet spots on the back , wonderful japanese mackerel from the genus scomber with blue bodies and silver heads , glittering azure goldfish whose name by itself gives their full description , several varieties of porgy or gilthead ( some banded gilthead with fins variously blue and yellow , some with horizontal heraldic bars and enhanced by a black strip around their caudal area , some with color zones and elegantly corseted in their six waistbands ) , trumpetfish with flutelike beaks that looked like genuine seafaring woodcocks and were sometimes a meter long , japanese salamanders , serpentine moray eels from the genus echidna that were six feet long with sharp little eyes and a huge mouth bristling with teeth ; etc .",38
"immediately they conducted candide to a beautiful pavilion adomed with a colonnade of green marble , spotted with yellow , and with an intertexture of vines , which served as a kind of cage for parrots , humming birds , guinea hens , and all other curious kinds of birds .",13

"on the flat of the green , just before this hollow place , i resolved to pitch my tent . this plain was not above a hundred yards broad , and about twice as long , and lay like a green before my door ; and , at the end of it , descended irregularly every way down into the low ground by the seaside . it was on the n.n.w . side of the hill ; so that it was sheltered from the heat every day , till it came to a w. and by s. sun , or thereabouts , which , in those countries , is near the setting .",40

"' come , my head 's free at last ! ' said alice in a tone of delight , which changed into alarm in another moment , when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found : all she could see , when she looked down , was an immense length of neck , which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her .",68
"' what can all that green stuff be ? ' said alice . ' and where have my shoulders got to ? and oh , my poor hands , how is it i ca n't see you ? ' she was moving them about as she spoke , but no result seemed to follow , except a little shaking among the distant green leaves .",5

"i would have been deeply interested in visiting this long , 360-league reef , against which the ever - surging sea broke with the fearsome intensity of thunderclaps . but just then the nautilus 's slanting fins took us to great depths , and i could see nothing of those high coral walls . i had to rest content with the various specimens of fish brought up by our nets . among others i noted some long - finned albacore , a species in the genus scomber , as big as tuna , bluish on the flanks , and streaked with crosswise stripes that disappear when the animal dies . these fish followed us in schools and supplied our table with very dainty flesh . we also caught a large number of yellow - green gilthead , half a decimeter long and tasting like dorado , plus some flying gurnards , authentic underwater swallows that , on dark nights , alternately streak air and water with their phosphorescent glimmers . among mollusks and zoophytes , i found in our trawl 's meshes various species of alcyonarian coral , sea urchins , hammer shells , spurred - star shells , wentletrap snails , horn shells , glass snails . the local flora was represented by fine floating algae : sea tangle , and kelp from the genus macrocystis , saturated with the mucilage their pores perspire , from which i selected a wonderful nemastoma geliniaroidea , classifying it with the natural curiosities in the museum .",134

""" a dog ! "" said holmes . "" by jove , a curly - haired spaniel . poor mortimer will never see his pet again . well , i do not know that this place contains any secret which we have not already fathomed . he could hide his hound , but he could not hush its voice , and hence came those cries which even in daylight were not pleasant to hear . on an emergency he could keep the hound in the out - house at merripit , but it was always a risk , and it was only on the supreme day , which he regarded as the end of all his efforts , that he dared do it . this paste in the tin is no doubt the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed . it was suggested , of course , by the story of the family hell - hound , and by the desire to frighten old sir charles to death . no wonder the poor devil of a convict ran and screamed , even as our friend did , and as we ourselves might have done , when he saw such a creature bounding through the darkness of the moor upon his track . it was a cunning device , for , apart from the chance of driving your victim to his death , what peasant would venture to inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight of it , as many have done , upon the moor ? i said it in london , watson , and i say it again now , that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more dangerous man than he who is lying yonder""--he swept his long arm towards the huge mottled expanse of green - splotched bog which stretched away until it merged into the russet slopes of the moor .",306
"suddenly he started . his eyes grew strangely bright , and he gnawed nervously at his underlip . between two of the windows stood a large florentine cabinet , made out of ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue lapis . he watched it as though it were a thing that could fascinate and make afraid , as though it held something that he longed for and yet almost loathed . his breath quickened . a mad craving came over him . he lit a cigarette and then threw it away . his eyelids drooped till the long fringed lashes almost touched his cheek . but he still watched the cabinet . at last he got up from the sofa on which he had been lying , went over to it , and having unlocked it , touched some hidden spring . a triangular drawer passed slowly out . his fingers moved instinctively towards it , dipped in , and closed on something . it was a small chinese box of black and gold - dust lacquer , elaborately wrought , the sides patterned with curved waves , and the silken cords hung with round crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads . he opened it . inside was a green paste , waxy in lustre , the odour curiously heavy and persistent .",210
"he wanted to train me to an elevation i could never reach ; it racked me hourly to aspire to the standard he uplifted . the thing was as impossible as to mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern , to give to my changeable green eyes the sea - blue tint and solemn lustre of his own .",48
"but as the bushes shrank , the tree forms magnified . actual petrified thickets and long alcoves from some fantastic school of architecture kept opening up before our steps . captain nemo entered beneath a dark gallery whose gentle slope took us to a depth of 100 meters . the light from our glass coils produced magical effects at times , lingering on the wrinkled roughness of some natural arch , or some overhang suspended like a chandelier , which our lamps flecked with fiery sparks . amid these shrubs of precious coral , i observed other polyps no less unusual : melita coral , rainbow coral with jointed outgrowths , then a few tufts of genus corallina , some green and others red , actually a type of seaweed encrusted with limestone salts , which , after long disputes , naturalists have finally placed in the vegetable kingdom . but as one intellectual has remarked , "" here , perhaps , is the actual point where life rises humbly out of slumbering stone , but without breaking away from its crude starting point .

"it was a squid of colossal dimensions , fully eight meters long . it was traveling backward with tremendous speed in the same direction as the nautilus . it gazed with enormous , staring eyes that were tinted sea green . its eight arms ( or more accurately , feet ) were rooted in its head , which has earned these animals the name cephalopod ; its arms stretched a distance twice the length of its body and were writhing like the serpentine hair of the furies . you could plainly see its 250 suckers , arranged over the inner sides of its tentacles and shaped like semispheric capsules . sometimes these suckers fastened onto the lounge window by creating vacuums against it . the monster 's mouth -- a beak made of horn and shaped like that of a parrot -- opened and closed vertically . its tongue , also of horn substance and armed with several rows of sharp teeth , would flicker out from between these genuine shears . what a freak of nature ! a bird 's beak on a mollusk ! its body was spindle - shaped and swollen in the middle , a fleshy mass that must have weighed 20,000 to 25,000 kilograms . its unstable color would change with tremendous speed as the animal grew irritated , passing successively from bluish gray to reddish brown .",39
"i rushed up onto the platform . yes , open sea ! barely a few sparse floes , some moving icebergs ; a sea stretching into the distance ; hosts of birds in the air and myriads of fish under the waters , which varied from intense blue to olive green depending on the depth . the thermometer marked 3 degrees centigrade . it was as if a comparative springtime had been locked up behind that ice bank , whose distant masses were outlined on the northern horizon .",50
"_ n.b._—i took such care of it that it lived , and the leg grew well and as strong as ever ; but , by my nursing it so long , it grew tame , and fed upon the little green at my door , and would not go away . this was the first time that i entertained a thought of breeding up some tame creatures , that i might have food when my powder and shot was all spent .",40

"the ceiling lights were off , yet the lounge was still brightly lit . this was due to the reflecting power of the walls of ice , which threw the beams of our beacon right back at us . words can not describe the effects produced by our galvanic rays on these huge , whimsically sculpted blocks , whose every angle , ridge , and facet gave off a different glow depending on the nature of the veins running inside the ice . it was a dazzling mine of gems , in particular sapphires and emeralds , whose jets of blue and green crisscrossed . here and there , opaline hues of infinite subtlety raced among sparks of light that were like so many fiery diamonds , their brilliance more than any eye could stand . the power of our beacon was increased a hundredfold , like a lamp shining through the biconvex lenses of a world - class lighthouse .",102

"aside and in special compartments , strings of supremely beautiful pearls were spread out , the electric light flecking them with little fiery sparks : pink pearls pulled from saltwater fan shells in the red sea ; green pearls from the rainbow abalone ; yellow , blue , and black pearls , the unusual handiwork of various mollusks from every ocean and of certain mussels from rivers up north ; in short , several specimens of incalculable worth that had been oozed by the rarest of shellfish . some of these pearls were bigger than a pigeon egg ; they more than equaled the one that the explorer tavernier sold the shah of persia for 3,000,000 francs , and they surpassed that other pearl owned by the imam of muscat , which i had believed to be unrivaled in the entire world .",37
