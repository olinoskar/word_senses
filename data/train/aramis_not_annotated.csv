at that moment aramis entered .,3
""" aramis , aramis ! "" cried d’artagnan , looking at his friend with an air of doubt .",1
""" and i also am to fight with this gentleman , "" said aramis , coming in his turn onto the place .",13
""" well , but , "" said aramis , "" have you not learned by the letter you found on the wretched corpse that she is in a convent ?",7
"yes , my dear aramis , we all know that your views have a religious tendency . """,4
""" i am only temporarily a musketeer , "" said aramis , humbly . "" it is some time since we heard from his mistress , "" said athos , in a low voice . "" but take no notice ; we know all about that . """,10
""" aramis !",1
""" hola , aramis !",3
""" my dear fellow , i invited them to a dinner the next day , "" replied aramis .",17
""" aramis ? """,1
here aramis paused .,1
""" let us see your idea , aramis , "" said athos , who felt much deference for the young musketeer .",7
"placed where he was , d’artagnan could not perceive the face of aramis . we say aramis , because the young man entertained no doubt that it was his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of the exterior . curiosity prevailed over prudence ; and profiting by the preoccupation into which the sight of the handkerchief appeared to have plunged the two personages now on the scene , he stole from his hiding place , and quick as lightning , but stepping with utmost caution , he ran and placed himself close to the angle of the wall , from which his eye could pierce the interior of aramis ’s room .",113
""" aramis ! who is he ? """,1
""" my dear aramis , you speak like theology personified .",3
""" must aramis do as much as i , madame ? "" said d’artagnan , deeply piqued .",2
""" speak lower , aramis , "" said athos .",4
he had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman was really mme . bonacieux and that the man was aramis .,23
""" here it is , "" said aramis , taking a small key from his breast and opening a little ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl , "" here it is . look . """,7
"on the morning of the eighth day , bazin , fresh as ever , and smiling , according to custom , entered the cabaret of the parpaillot as the four friends were sitting down to breakfast , saying , as had been agreed upon : "" monsieur aramis , the answer from your cousin . """,47
"making a sign to la houdiniere and cahusac to stop , he alighted from his horse , and went toward these suspected merry companions , hoping , by means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge which concealed his approach , to catch some words of this conversation which appeared so interesting . at ten paces from the hedge he recognized the talkative gascon ; and as he had already perceived that these men were musketeers , he did not doubt that the three others were those called the inseparables ; that is to say , athos , porthos , and aramis .",108
""" aramis ! """,1
"aramis ! """,0
""" but i hope that you will do us the honor to tell us , "" added aramis , in his politest tone and with his most graceful bow .",17
""" oh , what do i not owe you , aramis ? "" said d’artagnan .",10
""" now , "" continued aramis , taking the same graceful position in his easy chair that he would have assumed in bed , and complacently examining his hand , which was as white and plump as that of a woman , and which he held in the air to cause the blood to descend , "" now , as you have heard , d’artagnan , monsieur the principal is desirous that my thesis should be dogmatic , while i , for my part , would rather it should be ideal .",5
