"milady seemed overcome with joy , and made kitty repeat the smallest details of the pretended interview of the soubrette with de wardes when he received the letter ; how he had responded ; what was the expression of his face ; if he seemed very amorous . and to all these questions poor kitty , forced to put on a pleasant face , responded in a stifled voice whose dolorous accent her mistress did not however remark , solely because happiness is egotistical .",77

"now , as at the moment in which d’artagnan fixed his eyes upon the gentleman in the violet doublet , the gentleman made one of his most knowing and profound remarks respecting the bearnese pony , his two auditors laughed even louder than before , and he himself , though contrary to his custom , allowed a pale smile ( if i may allowed to use such an expression ) to stray over his countenance .",30

"an interminable debate then broke out between believers and skeptics in the scholarly societies and scientific journals . the "" monster question "" inflamed all minds . during this memorable campaign , journalists making a profession of science battled with those making a profession of wit , spilling waves of ink and some of them even two or three drops of blood , since they went from sea serpents to the most offensive personal remarks .",74

"this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again . in a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice , and shook itself . then it got down off the mushroom , and crawled away in the grass , merely remarking as it went , ' one side will make you grow taller , and the other side will make you grow shorter .

"she told me one evening , when more disposed to be communicative than usual , that john 's conduct , and the threatened ruin of the family , had been a source of profound affliction to her : but she had now , she said , settled her mind , and formed her resolution . her own fortune she had taken care to secure ; and when her mother died -- and it was wholly improbable , she tranquilly remarked , that she should either recover or linger long -- she would execute a long - cherished project : seek a retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from disturbance , and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous world .",79

"yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many his strange and dangerous charm . his great wealth was a certain element of security . society -- civilized society , at least-- is never very ready to believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and fascinating . it feels instinctively that manners are of more importance than morals , and , in its opinion , the highest respectability is of much less value than the possession of a good chef . and , after all , it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has given one a bad dinner , or poor wine , is irreproachable in his private life . even the cardinal virtues can not atone for half - cold entrées , as lord henry remarked once , in a discussion on the subject , and there is possibly a good deal to be said for his view . for the canons of good society are , or should be , the same as the canons of art . form is absolutely essential to it . it should have the dignity of a ceremony , as well as its unreality , and should combine the insincere character of a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us . is insincerity such a terrible thing ? i think not . it is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities .",139
