"then i began to lose my head . i arose with my arms stretched out before me , attempting painfully to feel my way . i began to run wildly , hurrying through the inextricable maze , still descending , still running through the substance of the earth 's thick crust , a struggling denizen of geological ' faults , ' crying , shouting , yelling , soon bruised by contact with the jagged rock , falling and rising again bleeding , trying to drink the blood which covered my face , and even waiting for some rock to shatter my skull against .",13

"it was an insane idea . fortunately i controlled myself and stretched out on the bed to soothe my bodily agitation . my nerves calmed a little , but with my brain so aroused , i did a swift review of my whole existence aboard the nautilus , every pleasant or unpleasant incident that had crossed my path since i went overboard from the abraham lincoln : the underwater hunting trip , the torres strait , our running aground , the savages of papua , the coral cemetery , the suez passageway , the island of santorini , the cretan diver , the bay of vigo , atlantis , the ice bank , the south pole , our imprisonment in the ice , the battle with the devilfish , the storm in the gulf stream , the avenger , and that horrible scene of the vessel sinking with its crew . . . ! all these events passed before my eyes like backdrops unrolling upstage in a theater . in this strange setting captain nemo then grew fantastically . his features were accentuated , taking on superhuman proportions . he was no longer my equal , he was the man of the waters , the spirit of the seas .",11

"in fact , there beneath my eyes was a town in ruins , demolished , overwhelmed , laid low , its roofs caved in , its temples pulled down , its arches dislocated , its columns stretching over the earth ; in these ruins you could still detect the solid proportions of a sort of tuscan architecture ; farther off , the remains of a gigantic aqueduct ; here , the caked heights of an acropolis along with the fluid forms of a parthenon ; there , the remnants of a wharf , as if some bygone port had long ago harbored merchant vessels and triple - tiered war galleys on the shores of some lost ocean ; still farther off , long rows of collapsing walls , deserted thoroughfares , a whole pompeii buried under the waters , which captain nemo had resurrected before my eyes !",36

"we have no need , therefore , to say that d’artagnan dared not join in the conversation , only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his ears , stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing ; and despite his confidence on the paternal admonitions , he felt himself carried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to blame the unheard - of things which were taking place .",32
"how different it was with material things ! where had they passed to ? where was the great crocus - coloured robe , on which the gods fought against the giants , that had been worked by brown girls for the pleasure of athena ? where the huge velarium that nero had stretched across the colosseum at rome , that titan sail of purple on which was represented the starry sky , and apollo driving a chariot drawn by white , gilt - reined steeds ? he longed to see the curious table - napkins wrought for the priest of the sun , on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast ; the mortuary cloth of king chilperic , with its three hundred golden bees ; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the bishop of pontus and were figured with "" lions , panthers , bears , dogs , forests , rocks , hunters -- all , in fact , that a painter can copy from nature "" ; and the coat that charles of orleans once wore , on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning "" madame , je suis tout joyeux , "" the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread , and each note , of square shape in those days , formed with four pearls .",52

"as he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and placed it in front of the terrier , who speedily licked it dry . sherlock holmes ' earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in silence , watching the animal intently , and expecting some startling effect . none such appeared , however . the dog continued to lie stretched upon the cushion , breathing in a laboured way , but apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught .",68

"while i was in view of the moor that was swimming , i stood out directly to sea with the boat , rather stretching to windward , that they might think me gone towards the straits ’ mouth ( as indeed any one that had been in their wits must have been supposed to do ) : for who would have supposed we were sailed on to the southward , to the truly barbarian coast , where whole nations of negroes were sure to surround us with their canoes and destroy us ; where we could not go on shore but we should be devoured by savage beasts , or more merciless savages of human kind .",23

"it was a squid of colossal dimensions , fully eight meters long . it was traveling backward with tremendous speed in the same direction as the nautilus . it gazed with enormous , staring eyes that were tinted sea green . its eight arms ( or more accurately , feet ) were rooted in its head , which has earned these animals the name cephalopod ; its arms stretched a distance twice the length of its body and were writhing like the serpentine hair of the furies . you could plainly see its 250 suckers , arranged over the inner sides of its tentacles and shaped like semispheric capsules . sometimes these suckers fastened onto the lounge window by creating vacuums against it . the monster 's mouth -- a beak made of horn and shaped like that of a parrot -- opened and closed vertically . its tongue , also of horn substance and armed with several rows of sharp teeth , would flicker out from between these genuine shears . what a freak of nature ! a bird 's beak on a mollusk ! its body was spindle - shaped and swollen in the middle , a fleshy mass that must have weighed 20,000 to 25,000 kilograms . its unstable color would change with tremendous speed as the animal grew irritated , passing successively from bluish gray to reddish brown .",68
