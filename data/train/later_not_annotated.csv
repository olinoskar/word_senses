""" look here , barrymore , "" said sir henry , sternly ; "" we have made up our minds to have the truth out of you , so it will save you trouble to tell it sooner rather than later . come , now ! no lies ! what were you doing at that window ? """,40

"a week later dorian gray was sitting in the conservatory at selby royal , talking to the pretty duchess of monmouth , who with her husband , a jaded - looking man of sixty , was amongst his guests . it was tea- time , and the mellow light of the huge , lace - covered lamp that stood on the table lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service at which the duchess was presiding . her white hands were moving daintily among the cups , and her full red lips were smiling at something that dorian had whispered to her . lord henry was lying back in a silk - draped wicker chair , looking at them . on a peach - coloured divan sat lady narborough , pretending to listen to the duke 's description of the last brazilian beetle that he had added to his collection . three young men in elaborate smoking - suits were handing tea - cakes to some of the women . the house - party consisted of twelve people , and there were more expected to arrive on the next day .",2
"this occurrence , extremely serious in itself , might perhaps have been forgotten like so many others , if three weeks later it had n't been reenacted under identical conditions . only , thanks to the nationality of the ship victimized by this new ramming , and thanks to the reputation of the company to which this ship belonged , the event caused an immense uproar .",21
""" oh , no , your excellency , he is not the devil , "" replied the host , with a grin of contempt ; "" for during his fainting we rummaged his valise and found nothing but a clean shirt and eleven crowns -- which however , did not prevent his saying , as he was fainting , that if such a thing had happened in paris , you should have cause to repent of it at a later period .

"a minute later the dry wood crackled and a cheerful flame , assisted by the vigorous blowing of the sailor , sprang up in the midst of the darkness .",2

""" these two writings are not by the same hand , "" he said ; "" the cipher is of later date than the book , an undoubted proof of which i see in a moment . the first letter is a double m , a letter which is not to be found in turlleson 's book , and which was only added to the alphabet in the fourteenth century . therefore there are two hundred years between the manuscript and the document . """,20
"a quarter of an hour later , our trunks were ready . conseil did them in a flash , and i was sure the lad had n't missed a thing , because he classified shirts and suits as expertly as birds and mammals .",5
"when i consulted the chart an hour later , i saw that the nautilus 's position was marked at longitude 16 degrees 17 ' and latitude 33 degrees 22 ' , a good 150 leagues from the nearest coast . it would n't do to even dream of escaping , and i 'll let the reader decide how promptly the canadian threw a tantrum when i ventured to tell him our situation .",7
"phileas fogg and his servant seated themselves in a first - class carriage at twenty minutes before nine ; five minutes later the whistle screamed , and the train slowly glided out of the station .",21
"a quarter of an hour later , conseil approached me , saying :",5
"an instant later , the longboat 's sailors helped us overboard one after the other , and we set foot on level sand in a meter and a half of water . captain nemo gave us a hand signal . we followed him down a gentle slope and disappeared under the waves .",2
"ten minutes later , captain nemo stopped suddenly . i thought he 'd called a halt so that we could turn and start back . no . with a gesture he ordered us to crouch beside him at the foot of a wide crevice . his hand motioned toward a spot within the liquid mass , and i looked carefully .",2
"some moments later , we saw a dozen crewmen set foot on the shelf of ice , among them ned land , easily recognized by his tall figure . captain nemo was with them .",2
half an hour later they arrived at the river .,3
"ayrton was on deck in two bounds , and three seconds later , having discharged his last barrel in the face of a pirate who was about to seize him by the throat , he leaped over the bulwarks into the sea .",11
"the son , who had been his father 's secretary , had resigned along with his chief , somewhat foolishly as was thought at the time , and on succeeding some months later to the title , had set himself to the serious study of the great aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing . he had two large town houses , but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble , and took most of his meals at his club . he paid some attention to the management of his collieries in the midland counties , excusing himself for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of burning wood on his own hearth .",32
"a moment later we were seated on a couch in the lounge , cigars between our lips . the captain placed before my eyes a working drawing that gave the ground plan , cross section , and side view of the nautilus . then he began his description as follows :",2
"finally , at five o'clock in the afternoon , laden with all our treasures , we left the island beach and half an hour later pulled alongside the nautilus . nobody appeared on our arrival . the enormous sheet - iron cylinder seemed deserted . our provisions loaded on board , i went below to my stateroom . there i found my supper ready . i ate and then fell asleep .",24
"the three of us followed him , and a few moments later , miraculously safe , we reached the fisherman 's longboat .",11
"meantime , as we have said , despite the cries of his conscience and the wise counsels of athos , dâ€™artagnan became hourly more in love with milady . thus he never failed to pay his diurnal court to her ; and the self - satisfied gascon was convinced that sooner or later she could not fail to respond .",52
"now , for all the reasons put forward to this point , i believed that this animal was a member of the branch vertebrata , class mammalia , group pisciforma , and finally , order cetacea . as for the family in which it would be placed ( baleen whale , sperm whale , or dolphin ) , the genus to which it belonged , and the species in which it would find its proper home , these questions had to be left for later . to answer them called for dissecting this unknown monster ; to dissect it called for catching it ; to catch it called for harpooning it-- which was ned land 's business ; to harpoon it called for sighting it-- which was the crew 's business ; and to sight it called for encountering it-- which was a chancy business .",84
"milady remained alone , with her eyes fixed upon the door . an instant later , the jingling of spurs was heard upon the stairs , steps drew near , the door opened , and a man appeared .",14
""" we propose to construct a vessel , "" said gideon spilett , "" sufficiently large to convey us to the nearest land ; but if we should succeed , sooner or later we shall return to lincoln island .",32
"three - quarters of an hour later , we had completed our circular stroll and were back on board . just then the crewmen finished loading the sodium supplies , and the nautilus could have departed immediately . but captain nemo gave no orders . would he wait for nightfall and exit through his underwater passageway in secrecy ? perhaps . be that as it may , by the next day the nautilus had left its home port and was navigating well out from any shore , a few meters beneath the waves of the atlantic .",6
"so ned land had good reason to worry . in these wide seas empty of islands , it was no longer feasible to jump ship . nor did we have any way to counter captain nemo 's whims . we had no choice but to acquiesce ; but if we could n't attain our end through force or cunning , i liked to think we might achieve it through persuasion . once this voyage was over , might not captain nemo consent to set us free in return for our promise never to reveal his existence ? our word of honor , which we sincerely would have kept . however , this delicate question would have to be negotiated with the captain . but how would he receive our demands for freedom ? at the very outset and in no uncertain terms , had n't he declared that the secret of his life required that we be permanently imprisoned on board the nautilus ? would n't he see my four - month silence as a tacit acceptance of this situation ? would my returning to this subject arouse suspicions that could jeopardize our escape plans , if we had promising circumstances for trying again later on ? i weighed all these considerations , turned them over in my mind , submitted them to conseil , but he was as baffled as i was . in short , although i 'm not easily discouraged , i realized that my chances of ever seeing my fellow men again were shrinking by the day , especially at a time when captain nemo was recklessly racing toward the south atlantic !",204
some hours later the colonists fulfilled the promise made to the captain by carrying out his dying wishes .,2
""" fine . stoke your furnaces and clap on full steam ! "" three cheers greeted this order . the hour of battle had sounded . a few moments later , the frigate 's two funnels vomited torrents of black smoke , and its deck quaked from the trembling of its boilers .",29
"even if , when their vessel should be completed , the colonists should not resolve to leave lincoln island as yet , in order to gain either one of the polynesian archipelagoes of the pacific or the shores of new zealand , they might at least , sooner or later , proceed to tabor island , to leave there the notice relating to ayrton .",49
"the nautilus passed over these lush , luxuriant depths with tremendous speed . near evening it approached the falkland islands , whose rugged summits i recognized the next day . the sea was of moderate depth . so not without good reason , i assumed that these two islands , plus the many islets surrounding them , used to be part of the magellan coastline . the falkland islands were probably discovered by the famous navigator john davis , who gave them the name davis southern islands . later sir richard hawkins called them the maidenland , after the blessed virgin . subsequently , at the beginning of the 18th century , they were named the malouines by fishermen from saint - malo in brittany , then finally dubbed the falklands by the english , to whom they belong today .",88
""" he will be one , as he says , "" cried porthos ; "" he will be one , sooner or later . """,22
this point can only be cleared up later .,7
""" obviously , "" i replied . "" and for the sake of archaeology , let 's hope that sooner or later such excavations do take place , once new towns are settled on the isthmus after the suez canal has been cut through-- a canal , by the way , of little use to a ship such as the nautilus ! """,21
many days passed ; but harding -- was it a sort of presentiment?--persisted in the fixed idea that sooner or later the unhappy man would return .,20
how it came there might be discussed later .,7
"so i begged ned to let me think about it before taking action . if this measure proved fruitless , it could arouse the captain 's suspicions , make our circumstances even more arduous , and jeopardize the canadian 's plans . i might add that i could hardly use our state of health as an argument . except for that grueling ordeal under the ice bank at the south pole , we had never felt better , neither ned , conseil , nor i. the nutritious food , life - giving air , regular routine , and uniform temperature kept illness at bay ; and for a man who did n't miss his past existence on land , for a captain nemo who was at home here , who went where he wished , who took paths mysterious to others if not himself in attaining his ends , i could understand such a life . but we ourselves had n't severed all ties with humanity . for my part , i did n't want my new and unusual research to be buried with my bones . i had now earned the right to pen the definitive book on the sea , and sooner or later i wanted that book to see the light of day .",205

"it had been used , apparently , in remote feudal times , for the worst purposes of a donjon - keep , and , in later days , as a place of deposit for powder , or some other highly combustible substance , as a portion of its floor , and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it , were carefully sheathed with copper .",25
five minutes later he was in the rue des fossoyeurs .,2
"each picture told a story ; mysterious often to my undeveloped understanding and imperfect feelings , yet ever profoundly interesting : as interesting as the tales bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings , when she chanced to be in good humour ; and when , having brought her ironing - table to the nursery hearth , she allowed us to sit about it , and while she got up mrs . reed 's lace frills , and crimped her nightcap borders , fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads ; or ( as at a later period i discovered ) from the pages of pamela , and henry , earl of moreland .",106
"he wished to stock their larder first , and domesticate those which they might take later .",15
"i heard its teeth grind on sheet iron , and the dugong disappeared , taking our harpoon along with it . but the barrel soon popped up on the surface , and a few moments later the animal 's body appeared and rolled over on its back . our skiff rejoined it , took it in tow , and headed to the nautilus .",35
"one evening , on the 15th of october , the conversation was prolonged later than usual .",13
"herbert , wishing to surprise pencroft , said nothing about the "" superb specimen of a chelonian "" which they had turned over on the sand ; but , two hours later , he and neb returned with the cart to the place where they had left it .",31
""" we will deal with them later , "" said harding .",6
"when a corpse floats a little distance from a low shore , it rarely happens that the tide does not throw it up , sooner or later .",26
"this dreadful scene on april 20 none of us will ever be able to forget . i wrote it up in a state of intense excitement . later i reviewed my narrative . i read it to conseil and the canadian . they found it accurate in detail but deficient in impact . to convey such sights , it would take the pen of our most famous poet , victor hugo , author of the toilers of the sea .",27
"a few moments later , eight strapping fellows appeared silently , their faces like masks , and dragged us down into their fearsome machine .",3
"two months earlier we would have enjoyed perpetual daylight in this latitude ; but night already fell for three or four hours , and later it would cast six months of shadow over these circumpolar regions .",24
"it was all very well to say ' drink me , ' but the wise little alice was not going to do that in a hurry . ' no , i 'll look first , ' she said , ' and see whether it 's marked "" poison "" or not ' ; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt , and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things , all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them : such as , that a red - hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long ; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife , it usually bleeds ; and she had never forgotten that , if you drink much from a bottle marked ' poison , ' it is almost certain to disagree with you , sooner or later .",160
"as to the streams which we do not know as yet , in different parts of the forest which we shall explore later , the creeks which afterwards will be discovered , we can christen them as we find them .",22
"ayrton said not a word , but , upon a sign from cyrus harding , resumed the oars , and half an hour later the engineer and he reached the entrance of dakkar grotto .",23
""" lincoln island does not resemble the other islands of the pacific , and a fact of which captain nemo has made me cognizant must sooner or later bring about the subversion of its foundation . """,27
"half an hour later , guided by its electric trail , we reached the nautilus . the outside door had been left open , and captain nemo closed it after we reentered the first cell . then he pressed a button . i heard pumps operating within the ship , i felt the water lowering around me , and in a few moments the cell was completely empty . the inside door opened , and we passed into the wardrobe .",3
"barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against the glass . his profile was half turned towards me , and his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the moor . for some minutes he stood watching intently . then he gave a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light . instantly i made my way back to my room , and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing once more upon their return journey . long afterwards when i had fallen into a light sleep i heard a key turn somewhere in a lock , but i could not tell whence the sound came . what it all means i can not guess , but there is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of . i do not trouble you with my theories , for you asked me to furnish you only with facts . i have had a long talk with sir henry this morning , and we have made a plan of campaign founded upon my observations of last night . i will not speak about it just now , but it should make my next report interesting reading .",147
"in an hour we had reached the islet . two hours later we had completed a full circle around it . it measured four to five miles in circumference . a narrow channel separated it from a considerable shore , perhaps a continent whose limits we could n't see . the existence of this shore seemed to bear out commander maury 's hypotheses . in essence , this ingenious american has noted that between the south pole and the 60th parallel , the sea is covered with floating ice of dimensions much greater than any found in the north atlantic . from this fact he drew the conclusion that the antarctic circle must contain considerable shores , since icebergs ca n't form on the high seas but only along coastlines . according to his calculations , this frozen mass enclosing the southernmost pole forms a vast ice cap whose width must reach 4,000 kilometers .",11
"passepartout thereupon recounted aouda 's history , the affair at the bombay pagoda , the purchase of the elephant for two thousand pounds , the rescue , the arrest , and sentence of the calcutta court , and the restoration of mr . fogg and himself to liberty on bail . fix , who was familiar with the last events , seemed to be equally ignorant of all that passepartout related ; and the later was charmed to find so interested a listener .",74
