"i stayed in my stateroom . i wanted to avoid the captain , to hide from his eyes the agitation overwhelming me . what an agonizing day i spent , torn between my desire to regain my free will and my regret at abandoning this marvelous nautilus , leaving my underwater research incomplete ! how could i relinquish this ocean--""my own atlantic , "" as i liked to call it -- without observing its lower strata , without wresting from it the kinds of secrets that had been revealed to me by the seas of the east indies and the pacific ! i was putting down my novel half read , i was waking up as my dream neared its climax ! how painfully the hours passed , as i sometimes envisioned myself safe on shore with my companions , or , despite my better judgment , as i sometimes wished that some unforeseen circumstances would prevent ned land from carrying out his plans .",135
"furious , ned tried to see through the mists on the horizon . he still hoped that behind all that fog there lay those shores he longed for .",24
"it would not thus be necessary to hunt . the engineer advised his companions to refrain from firing , that their presence might not be betrayed to any one near the shore .",31
"in fact , there beneath my eyes was a town in ruins , demolished , overwhelmed , laid low , its roofs caved in , its temples pulled down , its arches dislocated , its columns stretching over the earth ; in these ruins you could still detect the solid proportions of a sort of tuscan architecture ; farther off , the remains of a gigantic aqueduct ; here , the caked heights of an acropolis along with the fluid forms of a parthenon ; there , the remnants of a wharf , as if some bygone port had long ago harbored merchant vessels and triple - tiered war galleys on the shores of some lost ocean ; still farther off , long rows of collapsing walls , deserted thoroughfares , a whole pompeii buried under the waters , which captain nemo had resurrected before my eyes !",112
"a complete survey of the coast had not yet been made , and the colonists had but an imperfect idea of the shore to the west and north , from the mouth of falls river to the mandible capes , as well as of the narrow bay between them , which opened like a shark 's jaws .",22
"cyrus harding informed ayrton of the projected expedition , and proposed that he should take part in it , but ayrton preferring to remain on shore , it was decided that he should come to granite house during the absence of his companions .",25
the wind being right ahead it was necessary to hug the shore .,11
"it was agreed also that as they were anxious for a minute exploration of the coast they should not sail during the night , but would always , when the weather permitted it , be at anchor near the shore .",39
"it was not such a shore as is usually formed by nature , either by extending a vast carpet of sand , or by grouping masses of rock , but a beautiful border consisting of the most splendid trees .",5
"beyond , on the left bank , a few scattered trees appeared , and three miles further even these dwindled into solitary groups among the western spurs of the mountain , whose arid ridge sloped down to the shore .",38
"the colonists were then on the shore of an unimportant little harbor , which would scarcely have contained even two or three fishing - boats . it served as a neck to the new creek , of which the curious thing was that its waters , instead of joining the sea by a gentle slope , fell from a height of more than forty feet , which explained why the rising tide was not felt up the stream .",6
"instead of proceeding over the summit of a cliff or along a sandy beach , the settlers were obliged to remain under cover of the trees so that they might continue on the shore .",33
"and the "" bonadventure "" sailed as near as possible to the rocky shore .",13
"near three o'clock in the afternoon on july 6 , fifteen miles south of shore , the abraham lincoln doubled that solitary islet at the tip of the south american continent , that stray rock dutch seamen had named cape horn after their hometown of hoorn . our course was set for the northwest , and the next day our frigate 's propeller finally churned the waters of the pacific .",14
"three - quarters of an hour later , we had completed our circular stroll and were back on board . just then the crewmen finished loading the sodium supplies , and the nautilus could have departed immediately . but captain nemo gave no orders . would he wait for nightfall and exit through his underwater passageway in secrecy ? perhaps . be that as it may , by the next day the nautilus had left its home port and was navigating well out from any shore , a few meters beneath the waves of the atlantic .",85
""" follow my finger along the west coast of iceland . do you see rejkiavik , the capital ? you do . well ; ascend the innumerable fiords that indent those sea - beaten shores , and stop at the sixty - fifth degree of latitude . what do you see there ? """,34
"however that might be , on this evening no fire was lighted on these yet unknown shores , which formed the entrance to the gulf , and the little vessel stood off during the night .",16
"they could not see the sun , then hid by the vast screen of the upper cone , which masked the half - horizon of the west , and whose enormous shadow stretching to the shore increased as the radiant luminary sank in its diurnal course .",35
"nothing therefore which threw any light on the supposed wreck could be found on this shore , yet an object of any importance , such as the hull of a ship , would have been seen directly , or any of her masts and spars would have been washed on shore , just as the chest had been , which was found twenty miles from here .",15
"the shore was of course examined with the same care from the edge of the water to the cliff , and nothing could be discovered even with the aid of the instrument .",1
"perhaps , on climbing again to the summit of the cone , cyrus harding had had a hope of discovering some coast , some island shore , which he had not been able to perceive in the dark the evening before .",25
"immense waves threatened to overwhelm the island , and certainly any vessel anchored near the shore would have been dashed to pieces .",15
"the east part of the shore , where the castaways had landed , formed a wide bay , terminated by a sharp cape , which had been concealed by a high point from pencroft on his first exploration .",5
"from this point the shore ran pretty regularly north and south , broken at two - thirds of its perimeter by a narrow creek , from which it ended in a long tail , similar to the caudal appendage of a gigantic alligator .",4
"this tail formed a regular peninsula , which stretched more than thirty miles into the sea , reckoning from the cape southeast of the island , already mentioned ; it curled round , making an open roadstead , which marked out the lower shore of this strangely - formed land .",43
"at the narrowest part , that is to say between the chimneys and the creek on the western shore , which corresponded to it in latitude , the island only measured ten miles ; but its greatest length , from the jaws at the northeast to the extremity of the tail of the southwest , was not less than thirty miles .",18
"as to the interior of the island , its general aspect was this , very woody throughout the southern part from the mountain to the shore , and arid and sandy in the northern part .",25
"but , in short , granite house did not suffer much from the inclemency of the weather , and it was the same with the corral , which , less exposed than the plateau , and sheltered partly by mount franklin , only received the remains of the hurricanes , already broken by the forests and the high rocks of the shore .",61
the canoe touched the shore .,4
"here a question popped into my head . how did the commander of this aquatic residence go about it ? did he obtain air using chemical methods , releasing the oxygen contained in potassium chlorate by heating it , meanwhile absorbing the carbon dioxide with potassium hydroxide ? if so , he would have to keep up some kind of relationship with the shore , to come by the materials needed for such an operation . did he simply limit himself to storing the air in high - pressure tanks and then dispense it according to his crew 's needs ? perhaps . or , proceeding in a more convenient , more economical , and consequently more probable fashion , was he satisfied with merely returning to breathe at the surface of the water like a cetacean , renewing his oxygen supply every twenty - four hours ? in any event , whatever his method was , it seemed prudent to me that he use this method without delay .",63
"in an hour we had reached the islet . two hours later we had completed a full circle around it . it measured four to five miles in circumference . a narrow channel separated it from a considerable shore , perhaps a continent whose limits we could n't see . the existence of this shore seemed to bear out commander maury 's hypotheses . in essence , this ingenious american has noted that between the south pole and the 60th parallel , the sea is covered with floating ice of dimensions much greater than any found in the north atlantic . from this fact he drew the conclusion that the antarctic circle must contain considerable shores , since icebergs ca n't form on the high seas but only along coastlines . according to his calculations , this frozen mass enclosing the southernmost pole forms a vast ice cap whose width must reach 4,000 kilometers .",115

"the steamer passed along near the shores , but the savage papuans , who are in the lowest scale of humanity , but are not , as has been asserted , cannibals , did not make their appearance .",6
"it took us two hours to reach the summit of this half - crystal , half - basalt peak . from there our eyes scanned a vast sea , which scrawled its boundary line firmly against the background of the northern sky . at our feet : dazzling tracts of white . over our heads : a pale azure , clear of mists . north of us : the sun 's disk , like a ball of fire already cut into by the edge of the horizon . from the heart of the waters : jets of liquid rising like hundreds of magnificent bouquets . far off , like a sleeping cetacean : the nautilus . behind us to the south and east : an immense shore , a chaotic heap of rocks and ice whose limits we could n't see .",126
"numerous aquatic birds frequented the shores of this little ontario , in which the thousand isles of its american namesake were represented by a rock which emerged from its surface , some hundred feet from the southern shore .",37

"as to pelicans , kingfishers , water - hens , they came of themselves to the shores of the poultry - yard , and this little community , after some disputes , cooing , screaming , clucking , ended by settling down peacefully , and increased in encouraging proportion for the future use of the colony .",16
"bob harvey had seized , on the shores of norfolk island this brig , which was loaded with arms , ammunition , utensils , and tools of all sorts , destined for one of the sandwich islands .",7
"the 5th of april , which was wednesday , was twelve days from the time when the wind threw the castaways on this shore .",23
"harding and his companions had , therefore , not even the choice of flying and hiding themselves in the island , since the convicts intended to reside there , and since , in the event of the "" speedy "" departing on an expedition , it was probable that some of the crew would remain on shore , so as to settle themselves there .",56

"even if , when their vessel should be completed , the colonists should not resolve to leave lincoln island as yet , in order to gain either one of the polynesian archipelagoes of the pacific or the shores of new zealand , they might at least , sooner or later , proceed to tabor island , to leave there the notice relating to ayrton .",37
"they advanced to within five cables - lengths of that part of the shore terminated by flotsam point , and after having rounded it in a semicircular line , still protected by the brig 's guns , they proceeded towards the mouth of the mercy .",13
"on saturday , at six , we started afresh . in twenty minutes we reached a vast open space ; i then knew that the hand of man had not hollowed out this mine ; the vaults would have been shored up , and , as it was , they seemed to be held up by a miracle of equilibrium .",40
"mr . fogg , on reaching shore , proceeded to find out at what hour the first train left for new york , and learned that this was at six o'clock p.m. ; he had , therefore , an entire day to spend in the californian capital . taking a carriage at a charge of three dollars , he and aouda entered it , while passepartout mounted the box beside the driver , and they set out for the international hotel .",6
"soon i had put on my clothes , which were woven from strands of seashell tissue . more than once their composition provoked comments from conseil . i informed him that they were made from the smooth , silken filaments with which the fan mussel , a type of seashell quite abundant along mediterranean beaches , attaches itself to rocks . in olden times , fine fabrics , stockings , and gloves were made from such filaments , because they were both very soft and very warm . so the nautilus 's crew could dress themselves at little cost , without needing a thing from cotton growers , sheep , or silkworms on shore .",113
"during the lecture the train had been making good progress , and towards half - past twelve it reached the northwest border of the great salt lake . thence the passengers could observe the vast extent of this interior sea , which is also called the dead sea , and into which flows an american jordan . it is a picturesque expanse , framed in lofty crags in large strata , encrusted with white salt -- a superb sheet of water , which was formerly of larger extent than now , its shores having encroached with the lapse of time , and thus at once reduced its breadth and increased its depth .",92
"when their treasures had been safely conveyed on shore , harding and his companions agreed to devote some minutes to breakfast .",8
"for a quarter of an hour , i trod this blazing sand , which was strewn with tiny crumbs of seashell . looming like a long reef , the nautilus 's hull disappeared little by little , but when night fell in the midst of the waters , the ship 's beacon would surely facilitate our return on board , since its rays carried with perfect distinctness . this effect is difficult to understand for anyone who has never seen light beams so sharply defined on shore . there the dust that saturates the air gives such rays the appearance of a luminous fog ; but above water as well as underwater , shafts of electric light are transmitted with incomparable clarity .",86
"it so happened that , on all this part of the shore , pencroft had discovered the only habitable shelter , that is to say , the chimneys , which now had to be abandoned .",11
"the engineer now proposed to his companions to climb the slope , and to return to the chimneys by the heights , while exploring the northern and eastern shores of the lake .",28
"an important question then popped into my head . would the nautilus dare to tackle the english channel ? ned land ( who promptly reappeared after we hugged shore ) never stopped questioning me . what could i answer him ? captain nemo remained invisible . after giving the canadian a glimpse of american shores , was he about to show me the coast of france ?",28
"the nautilus kept to its southeasterly heading . on december 1 it cut the equator at longitude 142 degrees , and on the 4th of the same month , after a quick crossing marked by no incident , we raised the marquesas islands . three miles off , in latitude 8 degrees 57 ' south and longitude 139 degrees 32 ' west , i spotted martin point on nuku hiva , chief member of this island group that belongs to france . i could make out only its wooded mountains on the horizon , because captain nemo hated to hug shore . there our nets brought up some fine fish samples : dolphinfish with azure fins , gold tails , and flesh that 's unrivaled in the entire world , wrasse from the genus hologymnosus that were nearly denuded of scales but exquisite in flavor , knifejaws with bony beaks , yellowish albacore that were as tasty as bonito , all fish worth classifying in the ship 's pantry .",100
"so captain dumont d'urville had put to sea in command of a vessel named after the astrolabe , and just two months after dillon had left vanikoro , dumont d'urville dropped anchor before hobart . there he heard about dillon 's findings , and he further learned that a certain james hobbs , chief officer on the union out of calcutta , had put to shore on an island located in latitude 8 degrees 18 ' south and longitude 156 degrees 30 ' east , and had noted the natives of those waterways making use of iron bars and red fabrics .",65
"then dumont d'urville tried to depart ; but his crews were run down from the fevers raging on these unsanitary shores , and quite ill himself , he was unable to weigh anchor until march 17 .",20
"therefore an explosive substance must be manufactured , which would make a deep trench in some other part of the shore .",20
"as to the question of knowing where this channel ended , at what point of the shore , and at what depth beneath the water , it could not be answered .",16
"from that day forward , who knows where the nautilus took us in the north atlantic basin ? always at incalculable speed ! always amid the high arctic mists ! did it call at the capes of spitzbergen or the shores of novaya zemlya ? did it visit such uncharted seas as the white sea , the kara sea , the gulf of ob , the lyakhov islands , or those unknown beaches on the siberian coast ? i 'm unable to say . i lost track of the passing hours . time was in abeyance on the ship 's clocks . as happens in the polar regions , it seemed that night and day no longer followed their normal sequence . i felt myself being drawn into that strange domain where the overwrought imagination of edgar allan poe was at home . like his fabled arthur gordon pym , i expected any moment to see that "" shrouded human figure , very far larger in its proportions than any dweller among men , "" thrown across the cataract that protects the outskirts of the pole !",40

"when day had sufficiently lighted up the field of battle , the settlers counted as many as fifty dead bodies scattered about on the shore .",24
"but this illusion lasted a very short time . we were the only living creatures in this subterranean world . when the wind lulled , a deeper silence than that of the deserts fell upon the arid , naked rocks , and weighed upon the surface of the ocean . i then desired to pierce the distant haze , and to rend asunder the mysterious curtain that hung across the horizon . anxious queries arose to my lips . where did that sea terminate ? where did it lead to ? should we ever know anything about its opposite shores ?",99
"the sailor , observing the heavy surf on the shore , shook his head .",9
"at the same moment we reached the sand on the shore , and the waves were by slow degrees encroaching on the shore .",22
"the little band then continued their march forward , searching into every hollow of the shore .",15
"after a walk of a mile and a half , the shore presented no curve which would permit them to return to the north .",11

"so the skiff did n't leave shipside that day , much to the displeasure of mr . land who could n't complete his provisions . the adroit canadian spent his time preparing the meat and flour products he had brought from gueboroa island . as for the savages , they went back to shore near eleven o'clock in the morning , when the heads of coral began to disappear under the waves of the rising tide . but i saw their numbers swell considerably on the beach . it was likely that they had come from neighboring islands or from the mainland of papua proper . however , i did n't see one local dugout canoe .",53
"at this rate , he said , we shall make thirty leagues in twenty - four hours , and we shall soon come in sight of the opposite shore .",28
"my first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this moor , to get something for our subsistence on board ; for i told him we must not presume to eat of our patron ’s bread . he said that was true ; so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit , and three jars of fresh water , into the boat . i knew where my patron ’s case of bottles stood , which it was evident , by the make , were taken out of some english prize , and i conveyed them into the boat while the moor was on shore , as if they had been there before for our master . i conveyed also a great lump of beeswax into the boat , which weighed about half a hundred - weight , with a parcel of twine or thread , a hatchet , a saw , and a hammer , all of which were of great use to us afterwards , especially the wax , to make candles . another trick i tried upon him , which he innocently came into also : his name was ismael , which they call muley , or moely ; so i called to him—“moely , ” said i , “ our patron ’s guns are on board the boat ; can you not get a little powder and shot ? it may be we may kill some alcamies ( a fowl like our curlews ) for ourselves , for i know he keeps the gunner ’s stores in the ship . ” “ yes , ” says he , “ i ’ll bring some ; ” and accordingly he brought a great leather pouch , which held a pound and a half of powder , or rather more ; and another with shot , that had five or six pounds , with some bullets , and put all into the boat . at the same time i had found some powder of my master ’s in the great cabin , with which i filled one of the large bottles in the case , which was almost empty , pouring what was in it into another ; and thus furnished with everything needful , we sailed out of the port to fish . the castle , which is at the entrance of the port , knew who we were , and took no notice of us ; and we were not above a mile out of the port before we hauled in our sail and set us down to fish . the wind blew from the n.n.e . , which was contrary to my desire , for had it blown southerly i had been sure to have made the coast of spain , and at least reached to the bay of cadiz ; but my resolutions were , blow which way it would , i would be gone from that horrid place where i was , and leave the rest to fate .",107

"it is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor creatures at the noise and fire of my gun : some of them were even ready to die for fear , and fell down as dead with the very terror ; but when they saw the creature dead , and sunk in the water , and that i made signs to them to come to the shore , they took heart and came , and began to search for the creature . i found him by his blood staining the water ; and by the help of a rope , which i slung round him , and gave the negroes to haul , they dragged him on shore , and found that it was a most curious leopard , spotted , and fine to an admirable degree ; and the negroes held up their hands with admiration , to think what it was i had killed him with .",66

"in this dilemma , as i was very pensive , i stepped into the cabin and sat down , xury having the helm ; when , on a sudden , the boy cried out , “ master , master , a ship with a sail ! ” and the foolish boy was frighted out of his wits , thinking it must needs be some of his master ’s ships sent to pursue us , but i knew we were far enough out of their reach . i jumped out of the cabin , and immediately saw , not only the ship , but that it was a portuguese ship ; and , as i thought , was bound to the coast of guinea , for negroes . but , when i observed the course she steered , i was soon convinced they were bound some other way , and did not design to come any nearer to the shore ; upon which i stretched out to sea as much as i could , resolving to speak with them if possible .",158
"my next care was for some ammunition and arms . there were two very good fowling - pieces in the great cabin , and two pistols . these i secured first , with some powder - horns and a small bag of shot , and two old rusty swords . i knew there were three barrels of powder in the ship , but knew not where our gunner had stowed them ; but with much search i found them , two of them dry and good , the third had taken water . those two i got to my raft with the arms . and now i thought myself pretty well freighted , and began to think how i should get to shore with them , having neither sail , oar , nor rudder ; and the least capful of wind would have overset all my navigation .",122
"after i had been there about ten or twelve days , it came into my thoughts that i should lose my reckoning of time for want of books , and pen and ink , and should even forget the sabbath days ; but to prevent this , i cut with my knife upon a large post , in capital letters — and making it into a great cross , i set it up on the shore where i first landed—“i came on shore here on the 30th september 1659 . ” upon the sides of this square post i cut every day a notch with my knife , and every seventh notch was as long again as the rest , and every first day of the month as long again as that long one ; and thus i kept my calendar , or weekly , monthly , and yearly reckoning of time .",82
"september 30 , 1659.—i , poor miserable robinson crusoe , being shipwrecked during a dreadful storm in the offing , came on shore on this dismal , unfortunate island , which i called “ the island of despair ” ; all the rest of the ship ’s company being drowned , and myself almost dead .",22
"_ from the 1st of october to the 24th_.—all these days entirely spent in many several voyages to get all i could out of the ship , which i brought on shore every tide of flood upon rafts . much rain also in the days , though with some intervals of fair weather ; but it seems this was the rainy season .",31
"_ oct . _ 26.—i walked about the shore almost all day , to find out a place to fix my habitation , greatly concerned to secure myself from any attack in the night , either from wild beasts or men . towards night , i fixed upon a proper place , under a rock , and marked out a semicircle for my encampment ; which i resolved to strengthen with a work , wall , or fortification , made of double piles , lined within with cables , and without with turf .",8
"but the astonishing thing was that no smoke arose to show that the island was inhabited , no signal whatever appeared on the shore !",23
"now , on the one hand it was important to settle themselves in the neighborhood of a good stream of water , and on the other it was possible that the current had thrown cyrus harding on the shore there .",38
"_ dec _ . 11.—this day i went to work with it accordingly , and got two shores or posts pitched upright to the top , with two pieces of boards across over each post ; this i finished the next day ; and setting more posts up with boards , in about a week more i had the roof secured , and the posts , standing in rows , served me for partitions to part off the house .",17
"there was not a trace of a habitation in any part , not the print of a human foot on the shore of the island , which after four hours ' walking had been gone completely round .",21
"assuredly , the nautilus did n't avoid the heavily traveled seas of europe , and from this insight i concluded that the ship would take us back -- perhaps very soon -- to more civilized shores . i expected ned land to greet this news with unfeigned satisfaction .",35
"another reflection was of great use to me , and doubtless would be so to any one that should fall into such distress as mine was ; and this was , to compare my present condition with what i at first expected it would be ; nay , with what it would certainly have been , if the good providence of god had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up nearer to the shore , where i not only could come at her , but could bring what i got out of her to the shore , for my relief and comfort ; without which , i had wanted for tools to work , weapons for defence , and gunpowder and shot for getting my food .",97
"about four o’clock in the evening , being then within a league of the island , i found the point of the rocks which occasioned this disaster stretching out , as is described before , to the southward , and casting off the current more southerly , had , of course , made another eddy to the north ; and this i found very strong , but not directly setting the way my course lay , which was due west , but almost full north . however , having a fresh gale , i stretched across this eddy , slanting north - west ; and in about an hour came within about a mile of the shore , where , it being smooth water , i soon got to land .",116
"when i was on shore , god i fell on my knees and gave god thanks for my deliverance , resolving to lay aside all thoughts of my deliverance by my boat ; and refreshing myself with such things as i had , i brought my boat close to the shore , in a little cove that i had spied under some trees , and laid me down to sleep , being quite spent with the labour and fatigue of the voyage .",50
"in a kind of little bay , created by a point of the shore which broke the current , the sailor and the lad placed some good - sized pieces of wood , which they had fastened together with dry creepers . a raft was thus formed , on which they stacked all they had collected , sufficient , indeed , to have loaded at least twenty men .",13
"i soon found i had but a little passed by the place where i had been before , when i travelled on foot to that shore ; so taking nothing out of my boat but my gun and umbrella , for it was exceedingly hot , i began my march . the way was comfortable enough after such a voyage as i had been upon , and i reached my old bower in the evening , where i found everything standing as i left it ; for i always kept it in good order , being , as i said before , my country house .",25
"at last we leave the island , rounding away past the low rocks on its southern shore . hans has taken advantage of the halt to refit his rudder .",16
"ned land observed the sea with his penetrating eyes . it was deserted . the canadian sighted nothing new on the horizon , neither sail nor shore . a breeze was blowing noisily from the west , and disheveled by the wind , long billows made the submersible roll very noticeably .",26
"stretched out below them was the sandy shore , bounded on the right of the river 's mouth by lines of breakers .",7
at the northern extremity of the bay the outline of the shore was continued to a great distance in a wider curve .,11
"it was just at high - water when these people came on shore ; and while they rambled about to see what kind of a place they were in , they had carelessly stayed till the tide was spent , and the water was ebbed considerably away , leaving their boat aground . they had left two men in the boat , who , as i found afterwards , having drunk a little too much brandy , fell asleep ; however , one of them waking a little sooner than the other and finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it , hallooed out for the rest , who were straggling about : upon which they all soon came to the boat : but it was past all their strength to launch her , the boat being very heavy , and the shore on that side being a soft oozy sand , almost like a quicksand . in this condition , like true seamen , who are , perhaps , the least of all mankind given to forethought , they gave it over , and away they strolled about the country again ; and i heard one of them say aloud to another , calling them off from the boat , “ why , let her alone , jack , ca n’t you ? she ’ll float next tide ; ” by which i was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of what countrymen they were .",145
"we turned on our ruhmkorff devices and went along a coral shoal in the process of forming , which , given time , will someday close off this whole part of the indian ocean . our path was bordered by hopelessly tangled bushes , formed from snarls of shrubs all covered with little star - shaped , white - streaked flowers . only , contrary to plants on shore , these tree forms become attached to rocks on the seafloor by heading from top to bottom .",68
"it was probable , as gideon spilett observed , that things had occurred as follows : the six convicts , disembarking on the island , had followed the southern shore , and after having traversed the double shore of the serpentine peninsula , not being inclined to venture into the far west woods , they had reached the mouth of falls river .",29

"what an indescribable sight ! oh , if only we could share our feelings ! why were we imprisoned behind these masks of metal and glass ! why were we forbidden to talk with each other ! at least let us lead the lives of the fish that populate this liquid element , or better yet , the lives of amphibians , which can spend long hours either at sea or on shore , traveling through their double domain as their whims dictate !",72
"the boxes containing these were in a line upon the shore , in a perfect state of preservation ; for the most part the sea had spared them , and what with biscuits , salt meat , spirits , and salt fish , we might reckon on four months ' supply .",10
"for some days we saw a large number of aquatic birds with webbed feet , known as gulls or sea mews . some were skillfully slain , and when cooked in a certain fashion , they make a very acceptable platter of water game . among the great wind riders -- carried over long distances from every shore and resting on the waves from their exhausting flights-- i spotted some magnificent albatross , birds belonging to the longipennes ( long - winged ) family , whose discordant calls sound like the braying of an ass . the totipalmes ( fully webbed ) family was represented by swift frigate birds , nimbly catching fish at the surface , and by numerous tropic birds of the genus phaeton , among others the red - tailed tropic bird , the size of a pigeon , its white plumage shaded with pink tints that contrasted with its dark - hued wings .",57
"he motioned to me to look . an exclamation of astonishment burst from me . the north pole of the needle was turned to what we supposed to be the south . it pointed to the shore instead of to the open sea ! i shook the box , examined it again , it was in perfect condition . in whatever position i placed the box the needle pertinaciously returned to this unexpected quarter . therefore there seemed no reason to doubt that during the storm there had been a sudden change of wind unperceived by us , which had brought our raft back to the shore which we thought we had left so long a distance behind us .",106
"on the morning of the 24th , in latitude 12 degrees 5 ' south and longitude 94 degrees 33 ' , we raised keeling island , a madreporic upheaving planted with magnificent coconut trees , which had been visited by mr . darwin and captain fitzroy . the nautilus cruised along a short distance off the shore of this desert island . our dragnets brought up many specimens of polyps and echinoderms plus some unusual shells from the branch mollusca . captain nemo 's treasures were enhanced by some valuable exhibits from the delphinula snail species , to which i joined some pointed star coral , a sort of parasitic polypary that often attaches itself to seashells .",56
"to understand what followed , it must be borne in mind that , through circumstances hereafter to be explained , we were not really where the professor supposed we were . in fact we were not upon the north shore of the sea .",39
"with the chart under my eyes , i looked for the gulf of mannar . i found it by the 9th parallel off the northwestern shores of ceylon . it was formed by the long curve of little mannar island . to reach it we had to go all the way up ceylon 's west coast .",25
"we had long lost sight of the sea shore behind the hills of bones . the rash professor , careless of losing his way , hurried me forward . we advanced in silence , bathed in luminous electric fluid . by some phenomenon which i am unable to explain , it lighted up all sides of every object equally . such was its diffusiveness , there being no central point from which the light emanated , that shadows no longer existed . you might have thought yourself under the rays of a vertical sun in a tropical region at noonday and the height of summer . no vapour was visible . the rocks , the distant mountains , a few isolated clumps of forest trees in the distance , presented a weird and wonderful aspect under these totally new conditions of a universal diffusion of light . we were like hoffmann 's shadowless man .",8
""" no doubt ; even the tempest has put us on the right way . blessings on that storm ! it has brought us back to this coast from which fine weather would have carried us far away . suppose we had touched with our prow ( the prow of a rudder ! ) the southern shore of the liedenbrock sea , what would have become of us ? we should never have seen the name of saknussemm , and we should at this moment be imprisoned on a rockbound , impassable coast . """,56
"hans , with a vigorous thrust , sent us from the shore . the raft shot twenty fathoms out to sea .",11
"near 5:30 the first glimmers of light on the horizon defined the upper lines of the coast with greater distinctness . fairly flat to the east , it swelled a little toward the south . five miles still separated it from us , and its beach merged with the misty waters . between us and the shore , the sea was deserted . not a boat , not a diver . profound solitude reigned over this gathering place of pearl fishermen . as captain nemo had commented , we were arriving in these waterways a month too soon .",56
"all was white , from the summit of mount franklin to the shore , the forests , the plains , the lake , the river .",12
"then the nautilus drew near the beaches of africa , where the sea is considerably deeper . there , through the open panels and in a midwater of crystal clarity , our ship enabled us to study wonderful bushes of shining coral and huge chunks of rock wrapped in splendid green furs of algae and fucus . what an indescribable sight , and what a variety of settings and scenery where these reefs and volcanic islands leveled off by the libyan coast ! but soon the nautilus hugged the eastern shore where these tree forms appeared in all their glory . this was off the coast of tihama , and there such zoophyte displays not only flourished below sea level but they also fashioned picturesque networks that unreeled as high as ten fathoms above it ; the latter were more whimsical but less colorful than the former , which kept their bloom thanks to the moist vitality of the waters .",90
""" well , professor , are you pleased with this red sea ? have you seen enough of its hidden wonders , its fish and zoophytes , its gardens of sponges and forests of coral ? have you glimpsed the towns built on its shores ? """,44
"did these men arrive here voluntarily or involuntarily , by disembarking on the shore or by being wrecked ?",13
"they had explored , though only in an imperfect manner , the vast shore of washington bay from claw cape to reptile end , the woody and marshy border of the west coast , and the interminable downs , ending at the open mouth of shark gulf .",13
"milady , during the passage had contrived to untie the cord which fastened her feet . on coming near the bank , she jumped lightly on shore and took to flight .",26
"the day before , after having left the chimneys at daybreak , he had ascended the coast in a northerly direction , and had reached that part of the shore which he had already visited .",29
""" yes , if we 're close enough to shore and the ship 's afloat on the surface . no , if we 're well out and the ship 's navigating under the waters . """,9
"if captain grant is still living , he is living on the australian shores . '",13
"it was obvious to me that this mediterranean , pinned in the middle of those shores he wanted to avoid , gave captain nemo no pleasure . its waves and breezes brought back too many memories , if not too many regrets . here he no longer had the ease of movement and freedom of maneuver that the oceans allowed him , and his nautilus felt cramped so close to the coasts of both africa and europe .",15
"it was therefore agreed that the next morning at break of day , they should set out , by ascending the mercy so as to reach the western shore .",28
