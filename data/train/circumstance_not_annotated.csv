nevertheless it was a fortunate circumstance for the colonists that the effusion of lava should have been in the direction of lake grant .,5
"i stayed in my stateroom . i wanted to avoid the captain , to hide from his eyes the agitation overwhelming me . what an agonizing day i spent , torn between my desire to regain my free will and my regret at abandoning this marvelous nautilus , leaving my underwater research incomplete ! how could i relinquish this ocean--""my own atlantic , "" as i liked to call it -- without observing its lower strata , without wresting from it the kinds of secrets that had been revealed to me by the seas of the east indies and the pacific ! i was putting down my novel half read , i was waking up as my dream neared its climax ! how painfully the hours passed , as i sometimes envisioned myself safe on shore with my companions , or , despite my better judgment , as i sometimes wished that some unforeseen circumstances would prevent ned land from carrying out his plans .",154
"this issue settled , i went to find ned land . i wanted to take him with me . the obstinate canadian refused , and i could clearly see that his tight - lipped mood and his bad temper were growing by the day . under the circumstances i ultimately was n't sorry that he refused . in truth , there were too many seals ashore , and it would never do to expose this impulsive fisherman to such temptations .",47
"as for captain nemo , i wondered what he would make of our escaping , what concern or perhaps what distress it might cause him , and what he would do in the twofold event of our attempt either failing or being found out ! certainly i had no complaints to register with him , on the contrary . never was hospitality more wholehearted than his . yet in leaving him i could n't be accused of ingratitude . no solemn promises bound us to him . in order to keep us captive , he had counted only on the force of circumstances and not on our word of honor . but his avowed intention to imprison us forever on his ship justified our every effort .",102
""" we simply detailed the circumstances , and said that we should be glad of any information which could help us . """,5
""" nothing else ? is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears to hinge ? will you not telegraph again ? """,7
"but this hypothesis of a war machine collapsed in the face of formal denials from the various governments . since the public interest was at stake and transoceanic travel was suffering , the sincerity of these governments could not be doubted . besides , how could the assembly of this underwater boat have escaped public notice ? keeping a secret under such circumstances would be difficult enough for an individual , and certainly impossible for a nation whose every move is under constant surveillance by rival powers .",62
"how could it be otherwise , when helen , at all times and under all circumstances , evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship , which ill - humour never soured , nor irritation never troubled ?",15
"by january 2 we had fared 11,340 miles , hence 5,250 leagues , from our starting point in the seas of japan . before the nautilus 's spur there stretched the dangerous waterways of the coral sea , off the northeast coast of australia . our boat cruised along a few miles away from that daunting shoal where captain cook 's ships wellnigh miscarried on june 10 , 1770 . the craft that cook was aboard charged into some coral rock , and if his vessel did n't go down , it was thanks to the circumstance that a piece of coral broke off in the collision and plugged the very hole it had made in the hull .",96
"the missing person had evidently been swept off by the sea , which had just struck the net , and it was owing to this circumstance that the lightened balloon rose the last time , and then soon after reached the land .",25
"there was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances , though much to create despair . much too , you will think , reader , to engender jealousy : if a woman , in my position , could presume to be jealous of a woman in miss ingram 's .",10
"when i stood up , i saw captain nemo and his chief officer on the platform . they were examining the ship 's circumstances , exchanging a few words in their incomprehensible dialect .",23
"here is what those circumstances entailed . two miles to starboard lay gueboroa island , its coastline curving north to west like an immense arm . to the south and east , heads of coral were already on display , left uncovered by the ebbing waters . we had run aground at full tide and in one of those seas whose tides are moderate , an inconvenient state of affairs for floating the nautilus off . however , the ship had n't suffered in any way , so solidly joined was its hull . but although it could neither sink nor split open , it was in serious danger of being permanently attached to these reefs , and that would have been the finish of captain nemo 's submersible .",4
the maelstrom ! could a more frightening name have rung in our ears under more frightening circumstances ? were we lying in the dangerous waterways off the norwegian coast ? was the nautilus being dragged into this whirlpool just as the skiff was about to detach from its plating ?,16
"a new place , in a new house , amongst new faces , under new circumstances : i want this because it is of no use wanting anything better .",15
"i started , or rather ( for like other defaulters , i like to lay half the blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances ) was thrust on to a wrong tack at the age of one - and - twenty , and have never recovered the right course since : but i might have been very different ; i might have been as good as you -- wiser -- almost as stainless . i envy you your peace of mind , your clean conscience , your unpolluted memory .",23
"my business is to live without him now : nothing so absurd , so weak as to drag on from day to day , as if i were waiting some impossible change in circumstances , which might reunite me to him .",33
"resolute words these ! the man who could speak so , under such circumstances , was of no ordinary type .",13
"i do n't suppose the maddest geologist under such circumstances would have studied the nature of the rocks that we were passing . i am sure i did trouble my head about them . pliocene , miocene , eocene , cretaceous , jurassic , triassic , permian , carboniferous , devonian , silurian , or primitive was all one to me . but the professor , no doubt , was pursuing his observations or taking notes , for in one of our halts he said to me :",9
i have not much pride under such circumstances : i would always rather be happy than dignified ; and i ran after him -- he stood at the foot of the stairs .,7
"so ned land had good reason to worry . in these wide seas empty of islands , it was no longer feasible to jump ship . nor did we have any way to counter captain nemo 's whims . we had no choice but to acquiesce ; but if we could n't attain our end through force or cunning , i liked to think we might achieve it through persuasion . once this voyage was over , might not captain nemo consent to set us free in return for our promise never to reveal his existence ? our word of honor , which we sincerely would have kept . however , this delicate question would have to be negotiated with the captain . but how would he receive our demands for freedom ? at the very outset and in no uncertain terms , had n't he declared that the secret of his life required that we be permanently imprisoned on board the nautilus ? would n't he see my four - month silence as a tacit acceptance of this situation ? would my returning to this subject arouse suspicions that could jeopardize our escape plans , if we had promising circumstances for trying again later on ? i weighed all these considerations , turned them over in my mind , submitted them to conseil , but he was as baffled as i was . in short , although i 'm not easily discouraged , i realized that my chances of ever seeing my fellow men again were shrinking by the day , especially at a time when captain nemo was recklessly racing toward the south atlantic !",200
"i believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies , higher principles , and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed , education instilled , or destiny encouraged .",20
"phileas fogg had not concealed from sir francis his design of going round the world , nor the circumstances under which he set out ; and the general only saw in the wager a useless eccentricity and a lack of sound common sense . in the way this strange gentleman was going on , he would leave the world without having done any good to himself or anybody else .",18

"they asked themselves if by chance this incident might not have some connection with the inexplicable way in which the engineer had been saved , and the other peculiar circumstances which had struck them at different times .",29
""" because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you , and i dare say he has many a time regretted it since . he was once a schoolmaster in the north of england . now , there is no one more easy to trace than a schoolmaster . there are scholastic agencies by which one may identify any man who has been in the profession . a little investigation showed me that a school had come to grief under atrocious circumstances , and that the man who had owned it -- the name was different -- had disappeared with his wife . the descriptions agreed . when i learned that the missing man was devoted to entomology the identification was complete .

"now , whenever the king halted , the musketeers halted . it followed that d’artagnan , who was as yet purely and simply in the guards , found himself , for the time at least , separated from his good friends -- athos , porthos , and aramis . this separation , which was no more than an unpleasant circumstance , would have certainly become a cause of serious uneasiness if he had been able to guess by what unknown dangers he was surrounded .",59
"all the rest of the day i spent in afflicting myself at the dismal circumstances i was brought to — viz . i had neither food , house , clothes , weapon , nor place to fly to ; and in despair of any relief , saw nothing but death before me — either that i should be devoured by wild beasts , murdered by savages , or starved to death for want of food . at the approach of night i slept in a tree , for fear of wild creatures ; but slept soundly , though it rained all night .",14

"and if nothing happens without his knowledge , he knows that i am here , and am in this dreadful condition ; and if nothing happens without his appointment , he has appointed all this to befall me . nothing occurred to my thought to contradict any of these conclusions , and therefore it rested upon me with the greater force , that it must needs be that god had appointed all this to befall me ; that i was brought into this miserable circumstance by his direction , he having the sole power , not of me only , but of everything that happened in the world . immediately it followed : why has god done this to me ? what have i done to be thus used ? my conscience presently checked me in that inquiry , as if i had blasphemed , and methought it spoke to me like a voice : “ wretch ! dost _ thou _ ask what thou hast done ? look back upon a dreadful misspent life , and ask thyself what thou hast _ not _ done ? ask , why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed ? why wert thou not drowned in yarmouth roads ; killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the sallee man - of - war ; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of africa ; or drowned _ here _ , when all the crew perished but thyself ? dost _ thou _ ask , what have i done ? ” i was struck dumb with these reflections , as one astonished , and had not a word to say — no , not to answer to myself , but rose up pensive and sad , walked back to my retreat , and went up over my wall , as if i had been going to bed ; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed , and i had no inclination to sleep ; so i sat down in my chair , and lighted my lamp , for it began to be dark . now , as the apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me very much , it occurred to my thought that the brazilians take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers , and i had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests , which was quite cured , and some also that was green , and not quite cured .",84
