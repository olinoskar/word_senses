""" even less likely , ned . the devilfish is merely a mollusk , and even this name hints at its semiliquid flesh , because it 's latin meaning soft one . the devilfish does n't belong to the vertebrate branch , and even if it were 500 feet long , it would still be utterly harmless to ships like the scotia or the abraham lincoln . consequently , the feats of krakens or other monsters of that ilk must be relegated to the realm of fiction .

"now , for all the reasons put forward to this point , i believed that this animal was a member of the branch vertebrata , class mammalia , group pisciforma , and finally , order cetacea . as for the family in which it would be placed ( baleen whale , sperm whale , or dolphin ) , the genus to which it belonged , and the species in which it would find its proper home , these questions had to be left for later . to answer them called for dissecting this unknown monster ; to dissect it called for catching it ; to catch it called for harpooning it-- which was ned land 's business ; to harpoon it called for sighting it-- which was the crew 's business ; and to sight it called for encountering it-- which was a chancy business .",22

"while i was observing this phenomenal creature , two jets of steam and water sprang from its blowholes and rose to an altitude of forty meters , which settled for me its mode of breathing . from this i finally concluded that it belonged to the branch vertebrata , class mammalia , subclass monodelphia , group pisciforma , order cetacea , family . . . but here i could n't make up my mind . the order cetacea consists of three families , baleen whales , sperm whales , dolphins , and it 's in this last group that narwhales are placed . each of these families is divided into several genera , each genus into species , each species into varieties . so i was still missing variety , species , genus , and family , but no doubt i would complete my classifying with the aid of heaven and commander farragut .",46
"the aspect of the country , as well as the manners and distinctions of race , is daily changing . formerly one was obliged to travel in india by the old cumbrous methods of going on foot or on horseback , in palanquins or unwieldy coaches ; now fast steamboats ply on the indus and the ganges , and a great railway , with branch lines joining the main line at many points on its route , traverses the peninsula from bombay to calcutta in three days .",64

"there once more , through the panels opening into these caribbean waters ten meters below the surface of the waves , i found so many fascinating exhibits to describe in my daily notes ! among other zoophytes there were portuguese men - of - war known by the name physalia pelagica , like big , oblong bladders with a pearly sheen , spreading their membranes to the wind , letting their blue tentacles drift like silken threads ; to the eye delightful jellyfish , to the touch actual nettles that ooze a corrosive liquid . among the articulates there were annelid worms one and a half meters long , furnished with a pink proboscis , equipped with 1,700 organs of locomotion , snaking through the waters , and as they went , throwing off every gleam in the solar spectrum . from the fish branch there were manta rays , enormous cartilaginous fish ten feet long and weighing 600 pounds , their pectoral fin triangular , their midback slightly arched , their eyes attached to the edges of the face at the front of the head ; they floated like wreckage from a ship , sometimes fastening onto our windows like opaque shutters . there were american triggerfish for which nature has ground only black and white pigments , feather - shaped gobies that were long and plump with yellow fins and jutting jaws , sixteen - decimeter mackerel with short , sharp teeth , covered with small scales , and related to the albacore species . next came swarms of red mullet corseted in gold stripes from head to tail , their shining fins all aquiver , genuine masterpieces of jewelry , formerly sacred to the goddess diana , much in demand by rich romans , and about which the old saying goes : "" he who catches them does n't eat them ! "" finally , adorned with emerald ribbons and dressed in velvet and silk , golden angelfish passed before our eyes like courtiers in the paintings of veronese ; spurred gilthead stole by with their swift thoracic fins ; thread herring fifteen inches long were wrapped in their phosphorescent glimmers ; gray mullet thrashed the sea with their big fleshy tails ; red salmon seemed to mow the waves with their slicing pectorals ; and silver moonfish , worthy of their name , rose on the horizon of the waters like the whitish reflections of many moons .",144
"the journey was resumed at six in the morning ; the guide hoped to reach allahabad by evening . in that case , mr . fogg would only lose a part of the forty - eight hours saved since the beginning of the tour . kiouni , resuming his rapid gait , soon descended the lower spurs of the vindhias , and towards noon they passed by the village of kallenger , on the cani , one of the branches of the ganges . the guide avoided inhabited places , thinking it safer to keep the open country , which lies along the first depressions of the basin of the great river . allahabad was now only twelve miles to the north - east . they stopped under a clump of bananas , the fruit of which , as healthy as bread and as succulent as cream , was amply partaken of and appreciated .",79

"on the declivity of the atlantic basin the first streams , branches of the north platte river , already appeared . the whole northern and eastern horizon was bounded by the immense semi - circular curtain which is formed by the southern portion of the rocky mountains , the highest being laramie peak . between this and the railway extended vast plains , plentifully irrigated . on the right rose the lower spurs of the mountainous mass which extends southward to the sources of the arkansas river , one of the great tributaries of the missouri .",11

"fort mcpherson was left behind at eight in the morning , and three hundred and fifty - seven miles had yet to be traversed before reaching omaha . the road followed the capricious windings of the southern branch of the platte river , on its left bank . at nine the train stopped at the important town of north platte , built between the two arms of the river , which rejoin each other around it and form a single artery , a large tributary , whose waters empty into the missouri a little above omaha .",37

""" this was the first point gained . i then walked slowly down the garden path , which happened to be composed of a clay soil , peculiarly suitable for taking impressions . no doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush , but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning . there is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps . happily , i have always laid great stress upon it , and much practice has made it second nature to me . i saw the heavy footmarks of the constables , but i saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden . it was easy to tell that they had been before the others , because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them . in this way my second link was formed , which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number , one remarkable for his height ( as i calculated from the length of his stride ) , and the other fashionably dressed , to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots .",65

"anyone consulting conseil would soon learn from the gallant lad that the branch mollusca is divided into five classes ; that the first class features the cephalopoda ( whose members are sometimes naked , sometimes covered with a shell ) , which consists of two families , the dibranchiata and the tetrabranchiata , which are distinguished by their number of gills ; that the family dibranchiata includes three genera , the argonaut , the squid , and the cuttlefish , and that the family tetrabranchiata contains only one genus , the nautilus . after this catalog , if some recalcitrant listener confuses the argonaut , which is acetabuliferous ( in other words , a bearer of suction tubes ) , with the nautilus , which is tentaculiferous ( a bearer of tentacles ) , it will be simply unforgivable .",12
