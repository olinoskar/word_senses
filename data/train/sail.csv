"with the winter , work had been resumed in the interior of granite house , mending clothes and different occupations , among others making the sails for their vessel , which were cut from the inexhaustible balloon - case .",25,"('sail', 'voile', 'velar')",0
"soon the canadian announced that the craft was a big battleship , a double - decker ironclad complete with ram . dark , dense smoke burst from its two funnels . its furled sails merged with the lines of its yardarms . the gaff of its fore - and - aft sail flew no flag . its distance still kept us from distinguishing the colors of its pennant , which was fluttering like a thin ribbon .",33,"('sail', 'voile', 'velar')",0

"all this crazy talk was going on still when we met the hunter . everything was made ready for our instant departure . every bit of cordage was put on board . we took our places , and with our sail set , hans steered us along the coast to cape saknussemm .",40,"('sail', 'voile', 'velar')",0
"during this week , pencroft , aided by herbert , who handled the sailmaker 's needle with much skill , worked with such energy that the sails of the vessel were finished . there was no want of cordage .",26,"('sail', 'voile', 'velar')",0
"no more shore in sight . nothing but the immenseness of the sea . a few sails were on the horizon , no doubt ships going as far as cape são roque to find favorable winds for doubling the cape of good hope . the sky was overcast . a squall was on the way .",16,"('sail', 'voile', 'velar')",0
"herbert and the sailor then re - embarked on board the "" bonadventure , "" the anchor was weighed , the sail hoisted , and the wind drove her rapidly towards claw cape .",21,"('sail', 'voile', 'velar')",0
"during these two years not a vessel had passed in sight of the island ; or , at least , not a sail had been seen .",22,"('sail', 'voile', 'velar')",0
"during the first days , they went along smoothly enough . the sea was not very unpropitious , the wind seemed stationary in the north - east , the sails were hoisted , and the henrietta ploughed across the waves like a real trans - atlantic steamer .",29,"('sail', 'voile', 'velar')",0
"this was a misfortune . mr . fogg , in order not to deviate from his course , furled his sails and increased the force of the steam ; but the vessel 's speed slackened , owing to the state of the sea , the long waves of which broke against the stern . she pitched violently , and this retarded her progress . the breeze little by little swelled into a tempest , and it was to be feared that the henrietta might not be able to maintain herself upright on the waves .",20,"('sail', 'voile', 'velar')",0
"it was agreed also that as they were anxious for a minute exploration of the coast they should not sail during the night , but would always , when the weather permitted it , be at anchor near the shore .",19,"('sail', 'naviguer', 'navegar')",1

"the sails and the english flag were hoisted at ten minutes past three . mr . fogg and aouda , who were seated on deck , cast a last glance at the quay , in the hope of espying passepartout . fix was not without his fears lest chance should direct the steps of the unfortunate servant , whom he had so badly treated , in this direction ; in which case an explanation the reverse of satisfactory to the detective must have ensued . but the frenchman did not appear , and , without doubt , was still lying under the stupefying influence of the opium .",1,"('sail', 'voile', 'velar')",0
"phileas fogg , with body erect and legs wide apart , standing like a sailor , gazed without staggering at the swelling waters . the young woman , who was seated aft , was profoundly affected as she looked out upon the ocean , darkening now with the twilight , on which she had ventured in so frail a vessel . above her head rustled the white sails , which seemed like great white wings . the boat , carried forward by the wind , seemed to be flying in the air .",67,"('sail', 'voile', 'velar')",0
"the night was comparatively quiet . some of the sails were again hoisted , and the speed of the boat was very good . the next morning at dawn they espied the coast , and john bunsby was able to assert that they were not one hundred miles from shanghai . a hundred miles , and only one day to traverse them ! that very evening mr . fogg was due at shanghai , if he did not wish to miss the steamer to yokohama . had there been no storm , during which several hours were lost , they would be at this moment within thirty miles of their destination .",9,"('sail', 'voile', 'velar')",0
"the wind grew decidedly calmer , and happily the sea fell with it . all sails were now hoisted , and at noon the tankadere was within forty - five miles of shanghai .",15,"('sail', 'voile', 'velar')",0
"all on board feared that it could not be done , and every one -- phileas fogg , no doubt , excepted -- felt his heart beat with impatience . the boat must keep up an average of nine miles an hour , and the wind was becoming calmer every moment ! it was a capricious breeze , coming from the coast , and after it passed the sea became smooth . still , the tankadere was so light , and her fine sails caught the fickle zephyrs so well , that , with the aid of the currents john bunsby found himself at six o'clock not more than ten miles from the mouth of shanghai river . shanghai itself is situated at least twelve miles up the stream . at seven they were still three miles from shanghai . the pilot swore an angry oath ; the reward of two hundred pounds was evidently on the point of escaping him . he looked at mr . fogg . mr . fogg was perfectly tranquil ; and yet his whole fortune was at this moment at stake .",83,"('sail', 'voile', 'velar')",0

"how different it was with material things ! where had they passed to ? where was the great crocus - coloured robe , on which the gods fought against the giants , that had been worked by brown girls for the pleasure of athena ? where the huge velarium that nero had stretched across the colosseum at rome , that titan sail of purple on which was represented the starry sky , and apollo driving a chariot drawn by white , gilt - reined steeds ? he longed to see the curious table - napkins wrought for the priest of the sun , on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast ; the mortuary cloth of king chilperic , with its three hundred golden bees ; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the bishop of pontus and were figured with "" lions , panthers , bears , dogs , forests , rocks , hunters -- all , in fact , that a painter can copy from nature "" ; and the coat that charles of orleans once wore , on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning "" madame , je suis tout joyeux , "" the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread , and each note , of square shape in those days , formed with four pearls .",61,"('sail', 'voile', 'velar')",0

"in this dilemma , as i was very pensive , i stepped into the cabin and sat down , xury having the helm ; when , on a sudden , the boy cried out , “ master , master , a ship with a sail ! ” and the foolish boy was frighted out of his wits , thinking it must needs be some of his master ’s ships sent to pursue us , but i knew we were far enough out of their reach . i jumped out of the cabin , and immediately saw , not only the ship , but that it was a portuguese ship ; and , as i thought , was bound to the coast of guinea , for negroes . but , when i observed the course she steered , i was soon convinced they were bound some other way , and did not design to come any nearer to the shore ; upon which i stretched out to sea as much as i could , resolving to speak with them if possible .",44,"('sail', 'voile', 'velar')",0
