"his eye fell on the yellow book that lord henry had sent him . what was it , he wondered . he went towards the little , pearl - coloured octagonal stand that had always looked to him like the work of some strange egyptian bees that wrought in silver , and taking up the volume , flung himself into an arm - chair and began to turn over the leaves . after a few minutes he became absorbed . it was the strangest book that he had ever read . it seemed to him that in exquisite raiment , and to the delicate sound of flutes , the sins of the world were passing in dumb show before him . things that he had dimly dreamed of were suddenly made real to him . things of which he had never dreamed were gradually revealed .",65
"despite the buzzing in my head , i soon could hear vibrations under the nautilus 's hull . we tilted . the ice cracked with an odd ripping sound , like paper tearing , and the nautilus began settling downward .",37

"our full electric power was then put on the pumps , which instantly began to expel water from the ballast tanks . after a few minutes we had checked our fall . the pressure gauge soon indicated an ascending movement . brought to full speed , the propeller made the sheet - iron hull tremble down to its rivets , and we sped northward .",13

"porthos , seeing this , retwisted his mustache , elongated his imperial a second time , and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near the choir , and who not only was a beautiful lady , but still further , no doubt , a great lady -- for she had behind her a negro boy who had brought the cushion on which she knelt , and a female servant who held the emblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the mass .",17
"the steamer lay puffing alongside the quay , on the point of starting . passepartout had but few steps to go ; and , rushing upon the plank , he crossed it , and fell unconscious on the deck , just as the carnatic was moving off . several sailors , who were evidently accustomed to this sort of scene , carried the poor frenchman down into the second cabin , and passepartout did not wake until they were one hundred and fifty miles away from china . thus he found himself the next morning on the deck of the carnatic , and eagerly inhaling the exhilarating sea - breeze . the pure air sobered him . he began to collect his sense , which he found a difficult task ; but at last he recalled the events of the evening before , fix 's revelation , and the opium - house .",118

"how different it was with material things ! where had they passed to ? where was the great crocus - coloured robe , on which the gods fought against the giants , that had been worked by brown girls for the pleasure of athena ? where the huge velarium that nero had stretched across the colosseum at rome , that titan sail of purple on which was represented the starry sky , and apollo driving a chariot drawn by white , gilt - reined steeds ? he longed to see the curious table - napkins wrought for the priest of the sun , on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast ; the mortuary cloth of king chilperic , with its three hundred golden bees ; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the bishop of pontus and were figured with "" lions , panthers , bears , dogs , forests , rocks , hunters -- all , in fact , that a painter can copy from nature "" ; and the coat that charles of orleans once wore , on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning "" madame , je suis tout joyeux , "" the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread , and each note , of square shape in those days , formed with four pearls .",201

"these wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the storm lasted , and indeed some time after ; but the next day the wind was abated , and the sea calmer , and i began to be a little inured to it ; however , i was very grave for all that day , being also a little sea - sick still ; but towards night the weather cleared up , the wind was quite over , and a charming fine evening followed ; the sun went down perfectly clear , and rose so the next morning ; and having little or no wind , and a smooth sea , the sun shining upon it , the sight was , as i thought , the most delightful that ever i saw .",35
"i made no answer , but went and sat forward . the northern shore was already beginning to dip under the horizon . the eastern and western strands spread wide as if to bid us farewell . before our eyes lay far and wide a vast sea ; shadows of great clouds swept heavily over its silver - grey surface ; the glistening bluish rays of electric light , here and there reflected by the dancing drops of spray , shot out little sheaves of light from the track we left in our rear . soon we entirely lost sight of land ; no object was left for the eye to judge by , and but for the frothy track of the raft , i might have thought we were standing still .",16
"it happened one time , that going a - fishing in a calm morning , a fog rose so thick that , though we were not half a league from the shore , we lost sight of it ; and rowing we knew not whither or which way , we laboured all day , and all the next night ; and when the morning came we found we had pulled off to sea instead of pulling in for the shore ; and that we were at least two leagues from the shore . however , we got well in again , though with a great deal of labour and some danger ; for the wind began to blow pretty fresh in the morning ; but we were all very hungry .",115

"“ xury , ” says i , “ you shall on shore and kill him . ” xury , looked frighted , and said , “ me kill ! he eat me at one mouth!”—one mouthful he meant . however , i said no more to the boy , but bade him lie still , and i took our biggest gun , which was almost musket - bore , and loaded it with a good charge of powder , and with two slugs , and laid it down ; then i loaded another gun with two bullets ; and the third ( for we had three pieces ) i loaded with five smaller bullets . i took the best aim i could with the first piece to have shot him in the head , but he lay so with his leg raised a little above his nose , that the slugs hit his leg about the knee and broke the bone . he started up , growling at first , but finding his leg broken , fell down again ; and then got upon three legs , and gave the most hideous roar that ever i heard . i was a little surprised that i had not hit him on the head ; however , i took up the second piece immediately , and though he began to move off , fired again , and shot him in the head , and had the pleasure to see him drop and make but little noise , but lie struggling for life . then xury took heart , and would have me let him go on shore .",226
"it is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor creatures at the noise and fire of my gun : some of them were even ready to die for fear , and fell down as dead with the very terror ; but when they saw the creature dead , and sunk in the water , and that i made signs to them to come to the shore , they took heart and came , and began to search for the creature . i found him by his blood staining the water ; and by the help of a rope , which i slung round him , and gave the negroes to haul , they dragged him on shore , and found that it was a most curious leopard , spotted , and fine to an admirable degree ; and the negroes held up their hands with admiration , to think what it was i had killed him with .",75

"in this distress we had , besides the terror of the storm , one of our men die of the calenture , and one man and the boy washed overboard . about the twelfth day , the weather abating a little , the master made an observation as well as he could , and found that he was in about eleven degrees north latitude , but that he was twenty - two degrees of longitude difference west from cape st . augustino ; so that he found he was upon the coast of guiana , or the north part of brazil , beyond the river amazon , toward that of the river orinoco , commonly called the great river ; and began to consult with me what course he should take , for the ship was leaky , and very much disabled , and he was going directly back to the coast of brazil .",121

"my next care was for some ammunition and arms . there were two very good fowling - pieces in the great cabin , and two pistols . these i secured first , with some powder - horns and a small bag of shot , and two old rusty swords . i knew there were three barrels of powder in the ship , but knew not where our gunner had stowed them ; but with much search i found them , two of them dry and good , the third had taken water . those two i got to my raft with the arms . and now i thought myself pretty well freighted , and began to think how i should get to shore with them , having neither sail , oar , nor rudder ; and the least capful of wind would have overset all my navigation .",114
"i had been now thirteen days on shore , and had been eleven times on board the ship , in which time i had brought away all that one pair of hands could well be supposed capable to bring ; though i believe verily , had the calm weather held , i should have brought away the whole ship , piece by piece . but preparing the twelfth time to go on board , i found the wind began to rise : however , at low water i went on board , and though i thought i had rummaged the cabin so effectually that nothing more could be found , yet i discovered a locker with drawers in it , in one of which i found two or three razors , and one pair of large scissors , with some ten or a dozen of good knives and forks : in another i found about thirty - six pounds value in money — some european coin , some brazil , some pieces of eight , some gold , and some silver .",78

"after the third shock was over , and i felt no more for some time , i began to take courage ; and yet i had not heart enough to go over my wall again , for fear of being buried alive , but sat still upon the ground greatly cast down and disconsolate , not knowing what to do . all this while i had not the least serious religious thought ; nothing but the common “ lord have mercy upon me ! ” and when it was over that went away too .",17
"_ april _ 22.—the next morning i begin to consider of means to put this resolve into execution ; but i was at a great loss about my tools . i had three large axes , and abundance of hatchets ( for we carried the hatchets for traffic with the indians ) ; but with much chopping and cutting knotty hard wood , they were all full of notches , and dull ; and though i had a grindstone , i could not turn it and grind my tools too . this cost me as much thought as a statesman would have bestowed upon a grand point of politics , or a judge upon the life and death of a man . at length i contrived a wheel with a string , to turn it with my foot , that i might have both my hands at liberty .",7

"and if nothing happens without his knowledge , he knows that i am here , and am in this dreadful condition ; and if nothing happens without his appointment , he has appointed all this to befall me . nothing occurred to my thought to contradict any of these conclusions , and therefore it rested upon me with the greater force , that it must needs be that god had appointed all this to befall me ; that i was brought into this miserable circumstance by his direction , he having the sole power , not of me only , but of everything that happened in the world . immediately it followed : why has god done this to me ? what have i done to be thus used ? my conscience presently checked me in that inquiry , as if i had blasphemed , and methought it spoke to me like a voice : “ wretch ! dost _ thou _ ask what thou hast done ? look back upon a dreadful misspent life , and ask thyself what thou hast _ not _ done ? ask , why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed ? why wert thou not drowned in yarmouth roads ; killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the sallee man - of - war ; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of africa ; or drowned _ here _ , when all the crew perished but thyself ? dost _ thou _ ask , what have i done ? ” i was struck dumb with these reflections , as one astonished , and had not a word to say — no , not to answer to myself , but rose up pensive and sad , walked back to my retreat , and went up over my wall , as if i had been going to bed ; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed , and i had no inclination to sleep ; so i sat down in my chair , and lighted my lamp , for it began to be dark . now , as the apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me very much , it occurred to my thought that the brazilians take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers , and i had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests , which was quite cured , and some also that was green , and not quite cured .",351
"from the 14th of august to the 26th , incessant rain , so that i could not stir , and was now very careful not to be much wet . in this confinement , i began to be straitened for food : but venturing out twice , i one day killed a goat ; and the last day , which was the 26th , found a very large tortoise , which was a treat to me , and my food was regulated thus : i ate a bunch of raisins for my breakfast ; a piece of the goat ’s flesh , or of the turtle , for my dinner , broiled — for , to my great misfortune , i had no vessel to boil or stew anything ; and two or three of the turtle ’s eggs for my supper .",35

"thus i lived mighty comfortably , my mind being entirely composed by resigning myself to the will of god , and throwing myself wholly upon the disposal of his providence . this made my life better than sociable , for when i began to regret the want of conversation i would ask myself , whether thus conversing mutually with my own thoughts , and ( as i hope i may say ) with even god himself , by ejaculations , was not better than the utmost enjoyment of human society in the world ?",42

"after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance , and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming . it was the white rabbit returning , splendidly dressed , with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other : he came trotting along in a great hurry , muttering to himself as he came , ' oh ! the duchess , the duchess ! oh ! wo n't she be savage if i 've kept her waiting !

"in seeking to put our cargo into somewhat better order , i found that the greater part of the articles embarked had disappeared at the moment of the explosion , when the sea broke in upon us with such violence . i wanted to know exactly what we had saved , and with the lantern in my hand i began my examination . of our instruments none were saved but the compass and the chronometer ; our stock of ropes and ladders was reduced to the bit of cord rolled round the stump of the mast ! not a spade , not a pickaxe , not a hammer was left us ; and , irreparable disaster ! we had only one day 's provisions left .",59
