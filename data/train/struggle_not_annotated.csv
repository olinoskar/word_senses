"phileas fogg gazed at the tempestuous sea , which seemed to be struggling especially to delay him , with his habitual tranquillity . he never changed countenance for an instant , though a delay of twenty hours , by making him too late for the yokohama boat , would almost inevitably cause the loss of the wager . but this man of nerve manifested neither impatience nor annoyance ; it seemed as if the storm were a part of his programme , and had been foreseen . aouda was amazed to find him as calm as he had been from the first time she saw him .",12

"then i began to lose my head . i arose with my arms stretched out before me , attempting painfully to feel my way . i began to run wildly , hurrying through the inextricable maze , still descending , still running through the substance of the earth 's thick crust , a struggling denizen of geological ' faults , ' crying , shouting , yelling , soon bruised by contact with the jagged rock , falling and rising again bleeding , trying to drink the blood which covered my face , and even waiting for some rock to shatter my skull against .",53
"but more than that we were never destined to know , though there was much which we might surmise . there was no chance of finding footsteps in the mire , for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon them , but as we at last reached firmer ground beyond the morass we all looked eagerly for them . but no slightest sign of them ever met our eyes . if the earth told a true story , then stapleton never reached that island of refuge towards which he struggled through the fog upon that last night . somewhere in the heart of the great grimpen mire , down in the foul slime of the huge morass which had sucked him in , this cold and cruel - hearted man is forever buried .",89

"it was close upon nine when he set out . i had no idea how long he might be , but i sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages of henri murger 's "" vie de bohème . "" ten o'clock passed , and i heard the footsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed . eleven , and the more stately tread of the landlady passed my door , bound for the same destination . it was close upon twelve before i heard the sharp sound of his latch - key . the instant he entered i saw by his face that he had not been successful . amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the mastery , until the former suddenly carried the day , and he burst into a hearty laugh .",121
"oh , why was i so short of time ! i would have gone down the steep slopes of this mountain , crossed this entire immense continent , which surely connects africa with america , and visited its great prehistoric cities . under my eyes there perhaps lay the warlike town of makhimos or the pious village of eusebes , whose gigantic inhabitants lived for whole centuries and had the strength to raise blocks of stone that still withstood the action of the waters . one day perhaps , some volcanic phenomenon will bring these sunken ruins back to the surface of the waves ! numerous underwater volcanoes have been sighted in this part of the ocean , and many ships have felt terrific tremors when passing over these turbulent depths . a few have heard hollow noises that announced some struggle of the elements far below , others have hauled in volcanic ash hurled above the waves . as far as the equator this whole seafloor is still under construction by plutonic forces . and in some remote epoch , built up by volcanic disgorgings and successive layers of lava , who knows whether the peaks of these fire - belching mountains may reappear above the surface of the atlantic !",141
"it seemed as if an invisible bond had burst , and that i had struggled out into unhoped- for liberty .",14
"nothing else until the moment when , through a rift in the clouds , i saw the daring captain clinging to one of the animal 's fins , fighting the monster at close quarters , belaboring his enemy 's belly with stabs of the dagger yet unable to deliver the deciding thrust , in other words , a direct hit to the heart . in its struggles the man - eater churned the watery mass so furiously , its eddies threatened to knock me over .",66
"the waves were saturated with masses of blood . the waters shook with the movements of the man - eater , which thrashed about with indescribable fury . ned land had n't missed his target . this was the monster 's death rattle . pierced to the heart , it was struggling with dreadful spasms whose aftershocks knocked conseil off his feet .",51

was he engaged in a struggle with some animal whose retreat he had disturbed ?,5
in the manner of my friend i was at once struck with an incoherence — an inconsistency ; and i soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy — an excessive nervous agitation .,32

the taking of the capital of the confederates must have been the last action of this terrible struggle .,17
"the lamplight struggled out through the fog , and hallward looked at his watch . "" i have heaps of time , "" he answered .

"just as the poor little wretch was going to take to his heels , hans caught hold of him , and brought him to us , kicking and struggling .",28
"the whole thing occurred in a moment — so quickly that i had no time to realize it . i have a vivid recollection of that instant , of holmes ' triumphant expression and the ring of his voice , of the cabman 's dazed , savage face , as he glared at the glittering handcuffs , which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists . for a second or two we might have been a group of statues . then , with an inarticulate roar of fury , the prisoner wrenched himself free from holmes 's grasp , and hurled himself through the window . woodwork and glass gave way before him ; but before he got quite through , gregson , lestrade , and holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds . he was dragged back into the room , and then commenced a terrific conflict . so powerful and so fierce was he , that the four of us were shaken off again and again . he appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit . his face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass , but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance . it was not until lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and half - strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail ; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his hands . that done , we rose to our feet breathless and panting .",238
"we parted soon after ; for i made him little answer , and i saw him no more ; which way he went i knew not . as for me , having some money in my pocket , i travelled to london by land ; and there , as well as on the road , had many struggles with myself what course of life i should take , and whether i should go home or to sea .",57
"at noon hans prepared a hook at the end of a line . he baited it with a small piece of meat and flung it into the sea . for two hours nothing was caught . are these waters , then , bare of inhabitants ? no , there 's a pull at the line . hans draws it in and brings out a struggling fish .",64
"“ xury , ” says i , “ you shall on shore and kill him . ” xury , looked frighted , and said , “ me kill ! he eat me at one mouth!”—one mouthful he meant . however , i said no more to the boy , but bade him lie still , and i took our biggest gun , which was almost musket - bore , and loaded it with a good charge of powder , and with two slugs , and laid it down ; then i loaded another gun with two bullets ; and the third ( for we had three pieces ) i loaded with five smaller bullets . i took the best aim i could with the first piece to have shot him in the head , but he lay so with his leg raised a little above his nose , that the slugs hit his leg about the knee and broke the bone . he started up , growling at first , but finding his leg broken , fell down again ; and then got upon three legs , and gave the most hideous roar that ever i heard . i was a little surprised that i had not hit him on the head ; however , i took up the second piece immediately , and though he began to move off , fired again , and shot him in the head , and had the pleasure to see him drop and make but little noise , but lie struggling for life . then xury took heart , and would have me let him go on shore .",257
"a tall bulgarian soldier , six feet high , perceiving that i had fainted away at this sight , attempted to ravish me ; the operation brought me to my senses . i cried , i struggled , i bit , i scratched , i would have torn the tall bulgarian 's eyes out , not knowing that what had happened at my father 's castle was a customary thing . the brutal soldier , enraged at my resistance , gave me a wound in my left leg with his hanger , the mark of which i still carry .

"on january 18 the nautilus lay in longitude 105 degrees and latitude 15 degrees south . the weather was threatening , the sea rough and billowy . the wind was blowing a strong gust from the east . the barometer , which had been falling for some days , forecast an approaching struggle of the elements .",52

"captain nemo reentered his stateroom , and i saw no more of him for a good while . but how sad , despairing , and irresolute he must have felt , to judge from this ship whose soul he was , which reflected his every mood ! the nautilus no longer kept to a fixed heading . it drifted back and forth , riding with the waves like a corpse . its propeller had been disentangled but was barely put to use . it was navigating at random . it could n't tear itself away from the setting of this last struggle , from this sea that had devoured one of its own !",101

"we walked upon granite mingled with siliceous tufa . the soil shivers and shakes under our feet , like the sides of an overheated boiler filled with steam struggling to get loose . we come in sight of a small central basin , out of which the geyser springs . i plunge a register thermometer into the boiling water . it marks an intense heat of 325 ° , which is far above the boiling point ; therefore this water issues from an ardent furnace , which is not at all in harmony with professor liedenbrock 's theories . i can not help making the remark .",28
"then i sank into deep speculation , and captain nemo 's strange facial seizure kept haunting me . i was incapable of connecting two ideas in logical order , and i had strayed into the most absurd hypotheses , when i was snapped out of my mental struggles by these words from ned land : "" well , look here ! lunch is served !

"during the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles , and by evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from their enemies . at night - time they chose the base of a beetling crag , where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind , and there huddled together for warmth , they enjoyed a few hours ' sleep . before daybreak , however , they were up and on their way once more . they had seen no signs of any pursuers , and jefferson hope began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose enmity they had incurred . he little knew how far that iron grasp could reach , or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them .",7
everything in the apartment gave evidence of a violent and desperate struggle .,11
"but the skies became more and more threatening . there were conspicuous signs of a hurricane on the way . the atmosphere was turning white and milky . slender sheaves of cirrus clouds were followed on the horizon by layers of nimbocumulus . other low clouds fled swiftly . the sea grew towering , inflated by long swells . every bird had disappeared except a few petrels , friends of the storms . the barometer fell significantly , indicating a tremendous tension in the surrounding haze . the mixture in our stormglass decomposed under the influence of the electricity charging the air . a struggle of the elements was approaching .",104
"after nightfall the storm grew in intensity . as in the 1860 cyclone on réunion island , the barometer fell to 710 millimeters . at the close of day , i saw a big ship passing on the horizon , struggling painfully . it lay to at half steam in an effort to hold steady on the waves . it must have been a steamer on one of those lines out of new york to liverpool or le havre . it soon vanished into the shadows .",40
