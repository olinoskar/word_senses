"when at last she left you , you lapsed at once into deep reverie : you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery .",18
"towards two o'clock in the afternoon , while it was snowing hard , long whistles were heard approaching from the east . a great shadow , preceded by a wild light , slowly advanced , appearing still larger through the mist , which gave it a fantastic aspect . no train was expected from the east , neither had there been time for the succour asked for by telegraph to arrive ; the train from omaha to san francisco was not due till the next day . the mystery was soon explained .",32
"so as the fog - bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we were half a mile from the house , and still that dense white sea , with the moon silvering its upper edge , swept slowly and inexorably on .",39

"the torres strait is about thirty - four leagues wide , but it 's obstructed by an incalculable number of islands , islets , breakers , and rocks that make it nearly impossible to navigate . consequently , captain nemo took every desired precaution in crossing it . floating flush with the water , the nautilus moved ahead at a moderate pace . like a cetacean 's tail , its propeller churned the waves slowly .",74
"_ he _ , for it was a man , turned his head slowly towards where i stood , and having examined me with the two inquisitive - looking grey eyes which twinkled under a pair of bushy brows , said solemnly , and in a bass voice , "" her size is small : what is her age ? """,13
"but at a later period a wide chasm formed diagonally from south - west to north - east , through which was gradually forced out the trachyte which was to form a mountain chain . no violence accompanied this change ; the matter thrown out was in vast quantities , and the liquid material oozing out from the abysses of the earth slowly spread in extensive plains or in hillocky masses . to this period belong the felspar , syenites , and porphyries .",62
"he quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which divided us by about half . then , still keeping a hundred yards behind , we followed into oxford street and so down regent street . once our friends stopped and stared into a shop window , upon which holmes did the same . an instant afterwards he gave a little cry of satisfaction , and , following the direction of his eager eyes , i saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which had halted on the other side of the street was now proceeding slowly onward again .",99
"phileas fogg and his servant seated themselves in a first - class carriage at twenty minutes before nine ; five minutes later the whistle screamed , and the train slowly glided out of the station .",29
the carriage was put in motion as slowly as a funeral car .,7
"' all right , ' said the cat ; and this time it vanished quite slowly , beginning with the end of the tail , and ending with the grin , which remained some time after the rest of it had gone .",15
"speaking very slowly , he told him to tell the house - keeper that he wanted to see her , and then to go to the frame - maker and ask him to send two of his men round at once . it seemed to him that as the man left the room his eyes wandered in the direction of the screen . or was that merely his own fancy ?",2
"while he spoke , the lady madeline ( for so was she called ) passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment , and , without having noticed my presence , disappeared .",15
i tried to walk again : i dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it .,11
life was evidently ebbing slowly and his extremities were already cold .,4
"we now slowly ascended a drive , and came upon the long front of a house : candlelight gleamed from one curtained bow - window ; all the rest were dark . the car stopped at the front door ; it was opened by a maid - servant ; i alighted and went in .",2

"there he was , sure enough , a small urchin with a little bundle upon his shoulder , toiling slowly up the hill . when he reached the crest i saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant against the cold blue sky . he looked round him with a furtive and stealthy air , as one who dreads pursuit . then he vanished over the hill .",19
"sometimes when the cardinal , always on horseback , like the lowest gendarme of the army , cast a pensive glance over those works , so slowly keeping pace with his wishes , which the engineers , brought from all the corners of france , were executing under his orders , if he met a musketeer of the company of treville , he drew near and looked at him in a peculiar manner , and not recognizing in him one of our four companions , he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in another direction .",26
"the professor nodded slowly and uneasily like a man that declines to be convinced . i tried to resume the conversation . he answered not a word , and gave the signal for a start . i saw that his silence was nothing but ill - humour .",3

"" he held the light up again to the canvas and examined it . the surface seemed to be quite undisturbed and as he had left it . it was from within , apparently , that the foulness and horror had come . through some strange quickening of inner life the leprosies of sin were slowly eating the thing away . the rotting of a corpse in a watery grave was not so fearful .",98
"meanwhile as the sun slowly advanced , the shadow slowly diminished , and when it appeared to cyrus harding that it was beginning to increase , he asked , "" what o'clock is it ? "" "" one minute past five , "" replied gideon spilett directly .",9

"the thing was still seated in the chair , straining over the table with bowed head , and humped back , and long fantastic arms . had it not been for the red jagged tear in the neck and the clotted black pool that was slowly widening on the table , one would have said that the man was simply asleep .",45
"he still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip , and still his eye dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate ; thinking it urgent to say something , i asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the door , which was behind him .",2

"when in its early stages the earth was slowly cooling , its contraction gave rise in its crust to disruptions , distortions , fissures , and chasms . the passage through which we were moving was such a fissure , through which at one time granite poured out in a molten state . its thousands of windings formed an inextricable labyrinth through the primeval mass .",8

"ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes , jefferson hope had the scanty provisions and water , while lucy had a small bundle containing a few of her more valued possessions . opening the window very slowly and carefully , they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night , and then one by one passed through into the little garden . with bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it , and gained the shelter of the hedge , which they skirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfields . they had just reached this point when the young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the shadow , where they lay silent and trembling .",37
"the light afforded by the lamp , although feeble , nevertheless enabled the engineer to advance slowly , following the wall of the cavern .",16
"she made her brother talk of himself , his hopes , his prospects . he spoke slowly and with effort . they passed words to each other as players at a game pass counters . sibyl felt oppressed . she could not communicate her joy . a faint smile curving that sullen mouth was all the echo she could win . after some time she became silent . suddenly she caught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing lips , and in an open carriage with two ladies dorian gray drove past .",16
""" i 've got a good deal to say , "" our prisoner said slowly . "" i want to tell you gentlemen all about it . """,14

"so she called softly after it , ' mouse dear ! do come back again , and we wo n't talk about cats or dogs either , if you do n't like them ! ' when the mouse heard this , it turned round and swam slowly back to her : its face was quite pale ( with passion , alice thought ) , and it said in a low trembling voice , ' let us get to the shore , and then i 'll tell you my history , and you 'll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs . '",46
"suddenly he started . his eyes grew strangely bright , and he gnawed nervously at his underlip . between two of the windows stood a large florentine cabinet , made out of ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue lapis . he watched it as though it were a thing that could fascinate and make afraid , as though it held something that he longed for and yet almost loathed . his breath quickened . a mad craving came over him . he lit a cigarette and then threw it away . his eyelids drooped till the long fringed lashes almost touched his cheek . but he still watched the cabinet . at last he got up from the sofa on which he had been lying , went over to it , and having unlocked it , touched some hidden spring . a triangular drawer passed slowly out . his fingers moved instinctively towards it , dipped in , and closed on something . it was a small chinese box of black and gold - dust lacquer , elaborately wrought , the sides patterned with curved waves , and the silken cords hung with round crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads . he opened it . inside was a green paste , waxy in lustre , the odour curiously heavy and persistent .",146
""" this was the first point gained . i then walked slowly down the garden path , which happened to be composed of a clay soil , peculiarly suitable for taking impressions . no doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush , but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning . there is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps . happily , i have always laid great stress upon it , and much practice has made it second nature to me . i saw the heavy footmarks of the constables , but i saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden . it was easy to tell that they had been before the others , because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them . in this way my second link was formed , which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number , one remarkable for his height ( as i calculated from the length of his stride ) , and the other fashionably dressed , to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots .",11
"and yet it may seem a small matter in itself . you are aware that i am not a very sound sleeper , and since i have been on guard in this house my slumbers have been lighter than ever . last night , about two in the morning , i was aroused by a stealthy step passing my room . i rose , opened my door , and peeped out . a long black shadow was trailing down the corridor . it was thrown by a man who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in his hand . he was in shirt and trousers , with no covering to his feet . i could merely see the outline , but his height told me that it was barrymore . he walked very slowly and circumspectly , and there was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole appearance .",136
""" yes , dorian , i suppose you were right , "" said hallward slowly .",14
"they proceeded but slowly , frequently looking back ; but , in consequence of the inclination of the soil , the lava gained rapidly in the east , and as its lower waves became solidified others , at boiling heat , covered them immediately .",3
