"before i could reply , white smoke streamed from the battleship 's bow . then , a few seconds later , the waters splashed astern of the nautilus , disturbed by the fall of a heavy object . soon after , an explosion struck my ears .",45
"for some reason or other , the house was crowded that night , and the fat jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear to ear with an oily tremulous smile . he escorted them to their box with a sort of pompous humility , waving his fat jewelled hands and talking at the top of his voice . dorian gray loathed him more than ever . he felt as if he had come to look for miranda and had been met by caliban . lord henry , upon the other hand , rather liked him . at least he declared he did , and insisted on shaking him by the hand and assuring him that he was proud to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone bankrupt over a poet .",29
"mrs . fairfax had said mr . rochester possessed a fine voice : he did -- a mellow , powerful bass , into which he threw his own feeling , his own force ; finding a way through the ear to the heart , and there waking sensation strangely .",39
"it died away , and an absolute silence closed in upon us . we stood straining our ears , but nothing came .",17
"a few minutes before nine o'clock , i glued my ear to the captain 's door . not a sound . i left my stateroom and returned to the lounge , which was deserted and plunged in near darkness .",10
"it is true that the old house stood slightly off the perpendicular , and bulged out a little towards the street ; its roof sloped a little to one side , like the cap over the left ear of a tugendbund student ; its lines wanted accuracy ; but after all , it stood firm , thanks to an old elm which buttressed it in front , and which often in spring sent its young sprays through the window panes .",37
"mrs . reed soon rallied her spirits : she shook me most soundly , she boxed both my ears , and then left me without a word .",18
""" my gallant ned , "" i replied , "" for poets a pearl is a tear from the sea ; for orientals it 's a drop of solidified dew ; for the ladies it 's a jewel they can wear on their fingers , necks , and ears that 's oblong in shape , glassy in luster , and formed from mother - of - pearl ; for chemists it 's a mixture of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate with a little gelatin protein ; and finally , for naturalists it 's a simple festering secretion from the organ that produces mother - of - pearl in certain bivalves . """,48
"suddenly my ear , resting by chance against the wall , caught , or seemed to catch , certain vague , indescribable , distant , articulate sounds , as of words .",2
"i again began to listen . passing my ear over the wall from one place to another , i found the point where the voices seemed to be best heard . the word ' _ forlorad _ ' again returned ; then the rolling of thunder which had roused me from my lethargy .",8
""" i will tell you in your private ear , "" replied she , wagging her turban three times with portentous significancy .",8
"there was certainly too much of it in the air . even the duchess sneezed occasionally ; and as for the baby , it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment 's pause . the only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze , were the cook , and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear .",65
"i stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a hireling , and it was given me by you : i asked a question , expecting john 's wife to answer me , and your voice spoke at my ear . """,41
"this acoustic effect is easily explained on scientific grounds . it arose from the concave form of the gallery and the conducting power of the rock . there are many examples of this propagation of sounds which remain unheard in the intermediate space . i remember that a similar phenomenon has been observed in many places ; amongst others on the internal surface of the gallery of the dome of st . paul 's in london , and especially in the midst of the curious caverns among the quarries near syracuse , the most wonderful of which is called dionysius ' ear .",101
"suddenly from a lumpy tussock of old grass some twenty yards in front of them , with black - tipped ears erect and long hinder limbs throwing it forward , started a hare . it bolted for a thicket of alders . sir geoffrey put his gun to his shoulder , but there was something in the animal 's grace of movement that strangely charmed dorian gray , and he cried out at once , "" do n't shoot it , geoffrey . let it live .

"all the melody on earth is concentrated in my jane 's tongue to my ear ( i am glad it is not naturally a silent one ) : all the sunshine i can feel is in her presence . """,14
"in the midst of the tumult , and while my eyes and ears were fully engaged in the scene before me , i heard a hem close at my elbow : i turned , and saw sam .",12
"i then understood captain nemo 's intent . by leaving the pearl buried beneath the giant clam 's mantle , he allowed it to grow imperceptibly . with each passing year the mollusk 's secretions added new concentric layers . the captain alone was familiar with the cave where this wonderful fruit of nature was "" ripening "" ; he alone reared it , so to speak , in order to transfer it one day to his dearly beloved museum . perhaps , following the examples of oyster farmers in china and india , he had even predetermined the creation of this pearl by sticking under the mollusk 's folds some piece of glass or metal that was gradually covered with mother - of - pearl . in any case , comparing this pearl to others i already knew about , and to those shimmering in the captain 's collection , i estimated that it was worth at least 10,000,000 francs . it was a superb natural curiosity rather than a luxurious piece of jewelry , because i do n't know of any female ear that could handle it .",184
"athos went close to it , and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an interest that he made a sign to his friends to be silent , remaining himself bent with his ear directed to the opening of the lower orifice .",35
all three then sat down with their heads together and their ears on the alert .,11
"candide listened to this discourse with great attention , and conceived a high opinion of the person who delivered it ; and as the marchioness had taken care to place him near her side , he took the liberty to whisper her softly in the ear and ask who this person was that spoke so well .",45
""" i 'm all ears , captain . """,4
"the baron chanced to come by ; he beheld the cause and effect , and , without hesitation , saluted candide with some notable kicks on the breech and drove him out of doors . the lovely miss cunegund fainted away , and , as soon as she came to herself , the baroness boxed her ears . thus a general consternation was spread over this most magnificent and most agreeable of all possible castles .",56
"from th ’ abyss he ’ll give ear to my moan . """,7
""" we 're going through ! "" conseil muttered in my ear .",11
"i saw by his look , when he turned to me , that they were always written on the air between me and him ; whenever i spoke , they sounded in my voice to his ear , and their echo toned every answer he gave me .",36
"on the first cone rested a second , slightly rounded , and placed a little on one side , like a great round hat cocked over the ear .",27
"this other musketeer formed a perfect contrast to his interrogator , who had just designated him by the name of aramis . he was a stout man , of about two- or three - and - twenty , with an open , ingenuous countenance , a black , mild eye , and cheeks rosy and downy as an autumn peach . his delicate mustache marked a perfectly straight line upon his upper lip ; he appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their veins should swell , and he pinched the tips of his ears from time to time to preserve their delicate pink transparency .",95
""" what does this mean ? "" cried hallward , at last . his own voice sounded shrill and curious in his ears .",22
"this time the clerks evinced no inclination to laugh , such a real ear clipper did porthos appear .",13
"i spent an awful night . next morning i was called early . i had quite decided i would not open the door . but how was i to resist the sweet voice which was always music to my ears , saying , "" my dear axel ? """,39
"suddenly my clothes were seized by energetic hands , i felt myself pulled abruptly back to the surface of the sea , and yes , i heard these words pronounced in my ear :",32
"a group of old fakirs were capering and making a wild ado round the statue ; these were striped with ochre , and covered with cuts whence their blood issued drop by drop -- stupid fanatics , who , in the great indian ceremonies , still throw themselves under the wheels of juggernaut . some brahmins , clad in all the sumptuousness of oriental apparel , and leading a woman who faltered at every step , followed . this woman was young , and as fair as a european . her head and neck , shoulders , ears , arms , hands , and toes were loaded down with jewels and gems with bracelets , earrings , and rings ; while a tunic bordered with gold , and covered with a light muslin robe , betrayed the outline of her form .",97
"and yet it was not quite the last . i found myself weary and yet wakeful , tossing restlessly from side to side , seeking for the sleep which would not come . far away a chiming clock struck out the quarters of the hours , but otherwise a deathly silence lay upon the old house . and then suddenly , in the very dead of the night , there came a sound to my ears , clear , resonant , and unmistakable . it was the sob of a woman , the muffled , strangling gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow . i sat up in bed and listened intently . the noise could not have been far away and was certainly in the house . for half an hour i waited with every nerve on the alert , but there came no other sound save the chiming clock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall .",75
"before commencing , it is but fair to warn you that the story will sound somewhat hackneyed in your ears ; but stale details often regain a degree of freshness when they pass through new lips .",19
they rose expectant : eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered on my bones .,6
"his companions stared at each other , scarcely believing their ears .",10
"speak , then , i am all ears . """,7
"it was a little before the great rains just now mentioned that i threw this stuff away , taking no notice , and not so much as remembering that i had thrown anything there , when , about a month after , or thereabouts , i saw some few stalks of something green shooting out of the ground , which i fancied might be some plant i had not seen ; but i was surprised , and perfectly astonished , when , after a little longer time , i saw about ten or twelve ears come out , which were perfect green barley , of the same kind as our european — nay , as our english barley .",94
"while i paced softly on , the last sound i expected to hear in so still a region , a laugh , struck my ear . it was a curious laugh ; distinct , formal , mirthless .",24
"the housekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order of people , to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable piece of news without incurring the danger of having one 's ears pierced by some shrill ejaculation , and subsequently stunned by a torrent of wordy wonderment .",37

"such a prince ! as handsome as myself , sweet - tempered , agreeable , witty , and in love with me over head and ears . i loved him , too , as our sex generally do for the first time , with rapture , transport , and idolatry .",25
"this reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing - song in my ear : very painful and crushing , but only half intelligible .",14

"he had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them . even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bounded it . they must , he reflected , be awaiting him anxiously , for he had been absent nearly five hours . in the gladness of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re - echo to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming . he paused and listened for an answer . none came save his own cry , which clattered up the dreary silent ravines , and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions . again he shouted , even louder than before , and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago . a vague , nameless dread came over him , and he hurried onwards frantically , dropping the precious food in his agitation .",115
"this sudden illumination of our cabin enabled me to examine its tiniest details . it contained only a table and five stools . its invisible door must have been hermetically sealed . not a sound reached our ears . everything seemed dead inside this boat . was it in motion , or stationary on the surface of the ocean , or sinking into the depths ? i could n't tell .",37
"his mother ! he had something on his mind to ask of her , something that he had brooded on for many months of silence . a chance phrase that he had heard at the theatre , a whispered sneer that had reached his ears one night as he waited at the stage - door , had set loose a train of horrible thoughts . he remembered it as if it had been the lash of a hunting - crop across his face . his brows knit together into a wedgelike furrow , and with a twitch of pain he bit his underlip .",44
"my eyes fail under the dazzling light , my ears are stunned with the incessant crash of thunder . i must be bound to the mast , which bows like a reed before the mighty strength of the storm .",9

"but this time milady lent a more attentive ear than the first , and she heard their steps die away in the distance of the corridor .",8
""" yes , my friends , "" continued the engineer , "" such are the arithmetical progressions of prolific nature ; and yet what is this multiplication of the grain of corn , of which the ear only bears eight hundred grains , compared to the poppy - plant , which bears thirty - two thousand seeds ; to the tobacco - plant , which produces three hundred and sixty thousand ?",36
"when this was done , and all safe upon deck , the captain ordered the mate , with three men , to break into the round - house , where the new rebel captain lay , who , having taken the alarm , had got up , and with two men and a boy had got firearms in their hands ; and when the mate , with a crow , split open the door , the new captain and his men fired boldly among them , and wounded the mate with a musket ball , which broke his arm , and wounded two more of the men , but killed nobody . the mate , calling for help , rushed , however , into the round - house , wounded as he was , and , with his pistol , shot the new captain through the head , the bullet entering at his mouth , and came out again behind one of his ears , so that he never spoke a word more : upon which the rest yielded , and the ship was taken effectually , without any more lives lost .",163
"it was a magnificent sea otter from the genus enhydra , the only exclusively marine quadruped . one and a half meters long , this otter had to be worth a good high price . its coat , chestnut brown above and silver below , would have made one of those wonderful fur pieces so much in demand in the russian and chinese markets ; the fineness and luster of its pelt guaranteed that it would go for at least 2,000 francs . i was full of wonderment at this unusual mammal , with its circular head adorned by short ears , its round eyes , its white whiskers like those on a cat , its webbed and clawed feet , its bushy tail . hunted and trapped by fishermen , this valuable carnivore has become extremely rare , and it takes refuge chiefly in the northernmost parts of the pacific , where in all likelihood its species will soon be facing extinction .",100
