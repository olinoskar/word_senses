"perceiving their danger , the passengers cast away the last articles which still weighed down the car , the few provisions they had kept , everything , even to their pocket - knives , and one of them , having hoisted himself on to the circles which united the cords of the net , tried to secure more firmly the lower point of the balloon .",0
"here he is ! "" d’artagnan , walking and soliloquizing , had arrived within a few steps of the hotel d’arguillon and in front of that hotel perceived aramis , chatting gaily with three gentlemen ; but as he had not forgotten that it was in presence of this young man that m. de treville had been so angry in the morning , and as a witness of the rebuke the musketeers had received was not likely to be at all agreeable , he pretended not to see him .",27
"d’artagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many ; but he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world to know how to extricate himself gallantly from a false position , like that of a man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely acquainted with and in a conversation that does not concern him .",8
"this time d’artagnan was not hasty . he perceived his mistake ; but the friends of aramis were not at all convinced by his denial , and one of them addressed the young musketeer with affected seriousness .",8
"the two guardsmen courteously accepted d’artagnan ’s excuses , and perceiving that the four friends desired to be alone , retired .",10

"felton had fallen ; but there was still another step to be taken . he must be retained , or rather he must be left quite alone ; and milady but obscurely perceived the means which could lead to this result .",32

"the captain , who was really alarmed , did not know what course to take . should he send another detachment to the rescue of the first ? should he sacrifice more men , with so few chances of saving those already sacrificed ? his hesitation did not last long , however . calling one of his lieutenants , he was on the point of ordering a reconnaissance , when gunshots were heard . was it a signal ? the soldiers rushed out of the fort , and half a mile off they perceived a little band returning in good order .",93

"passing alongside one of them , d’artagnan fancied he perceived on board it the woman of meung -- the same whom the unknown gentleman had called milady , and whom d’artagnan had thought so handsome ; but thanks to the current of the stream and a fair wind , his vessel passed so quickly that he had little more than a glimpse of her .",9

milady plainly perceived that it was now her turn to take part in the scene .,2
"the two young men bowed and separated , aramis ascending the street which led to the luxembourg , while d’artagnan , perceiving the appointed hour was approaching , took the road to the carmes - deschaux , saying to himself , "" decidedly i ca n’t draw back ; but at least , if i am killed , i shall be killed by a musketeer .

"there were monks who wore the frock with such an ill grace that it was easy to perceive they belonged to the church militant ; women a little inconvenienced by their costume as pages and whose large trousers could not entirely conceal their rounded forms ; and peasants with blackened hands but with fine limbs , savoring of the man of quality a league off .",17
"now , one evening when d’artagnan , who was in the trenches , was not able to accompany them , athos , porthos , and aramis , mounted on their battle steeds , enveloped in their war cloaks , with their hands upon their pistol butts , were returning from a drinking place called the red dovecot , which athos had discovered two days before upon the route to jarrie , following the road which led to the camp and quite on their guard , as we have stated , for fear of an ambuscade , when , about a quarter of a league from the village of boisnau , they fancied they heard the sound of horses approaching them . they immediately all three halted , closed in , and waited , occupying the middle of the road . in an instant , and as the moon broke from behind a cloud , they saw at a turning of the road two horsemen who , on perceiving them , stopped in their turn , appearing to deliberate whether they should continue their route or go back .",167
"when they reached the surface they could only perceive , at half a cable 's length , this mass of rocks , towards which they swam and on which they found footing .",8
"at this moment the door of the dining room unclosed with a creak , and porthos perceived through the half - open flap the little clerk who , not being allowed to take part in the feast , ate his dry bread in the passage with the double odor of the dining room and kitchen .",16
"such as it was , it did us good service . the steepness increased , but these stone steps allowed us to rise with facility , and even with such rapidity that , having rested for a moment while my companions continued their ascent , i perceived them already reduced by distance to microscopic dimensions .",46
"the host desired himself to serve him ; which d’artagnan perceiving , ordered two glasses to be brought , and commenced the following conversation .",10
"d’artagnan had just passed the rue cassette , and already perceived the door of his friend ’s house , shaded by a mass of sycamores and clematis which formed a vast arch opposite the front of it , when he perceived something like a shadow issuing from the rue servandoni .",10

everything in her mind was lost for an instant ; when all at once she perceived that no signature was attached to the order .,15
""" yes , yes , "" said lord de winter , who perceived what was passing in her mind ; "" yes , you look for the signature , and you say to yourself : ’ all is not lost , for that order is not signed . it is only shown to me to terrify me , that ’s all . ’",12

"then the hand was withdrawn , leaving in his an object which he perceived to be a ring .",13
"on looking around him , however , as he could perceive no threatening object , as nothing indicated that he ran any real danger , as the bench was comfortably covered with a well - stuffed cushion , as the wall was ornamented with a beautiful cordova leather , and as large red damask curtains , fastened back by gold clasps , floated before the window , he perceived by degrees that his fear was exaggerated , and he began to turn his head to the right and the left , upward and downward .",10
d’artagnan at once perceived the ground which the vindictive creature wished to reach .,3
""" yes , it was i ; so you may plainly perceive that you have no mercy to expect if you do not tell me the whole truth . """,11
"another three hours , and i saw no bottom to the chimney yet . when i lifted my head i perceived the gradual contraction of its aperture . its walls , by a gentle incline , were drawing closer to each other , and it was beginning to grow darker .",20

"when a door , at length , closed upon her , my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother ; but he had buried his face in his hands , and i could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears .",37
"and thus , as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit , the more bitterly did i perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness , as if an inherent positive quality , poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe in one unceasing radiation of gloom .",26
""" well , madame , i perceive i must do as you wish . """,6
"a slight shade passed over the brow of bonacieux , but so slight that d’artagnan did not perceive it .",17
""" and we are going to be recompensed for our diligence ?

"i was , perhaps , the more forcibly impressed with it as he gave it , because , in the under or mystic current of its meaning , i fancied that i perceived , and for the first time , a full consciousness on the part of usher of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne .",32
"this time bonacieux became so pale that d’artagnan could not help perceiving it , and asked him what was the matter .",11
"while they were disputing on this important subject , and still expecting miss cunegund , candide perceived a young theatin friar in the piazza san marco , with a girl under his arm . the theatin looked fresh - colored , plump , and vigorous ; his eyes sparkled ; his air and gait were bold and lofty . the girl was pretty , and was singing a song ; and every now and then gave her theatin an amorous ogle and wantonly pinched his ruddy cheeks .",16

"making a sign to la houdiniere and cahusac to stop , he alighted from his horse , and went toward these suspected merry companions , hoping , by means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge which concealed his approach , to catch some words of this conversation which appeared so interesting . at ten paces from the hedge he recognized the talkative gascon ; and as he had already perceived that these men were musketeers , he did not doubt that the three others were those called the inseparables ; that is to say , athos , porthos , and aramis .",77
"in an instant d’artagnan perceived that the best way in which he could act would be to go home and write milady a long letter , in which he would confess to her that he and de wardes were , up to the present moment absolutely the same , and that consequently he could not undertake , without committing suicide , to kill the comte de wardes .",4

"i had three encouragements—1st , a smooth , calm sea ; 2ndly , the tide rising , and setting in to the shore ; 3rdly , what little wind there was blew me towards the land . and thus , having found two or three broken oars belonging to the boat — and , besides the tools which were in the chest , i found two saws , an axe , and a hammer ; with this cargo i put to sea . for a mile or thereabouts my raft went very well , only that i found it drive a little distant from the place where i had landed before ; by which i perceived that there was some indraft of the water , and consequently i hoped to find some creek or river there , which i might make use of as a port to get to land with my cargo .",115
"from that day the smoke never disappeared from the top of the mountain , and it could even be perceived that it increased in height and thickness , without any flame mingling in its heavy volumes .",19

"a whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity ; for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind ; and the exceeding density of the clouds ( which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house ) did not prevent our perceiving the life - like velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other , without passing away into the distance .",51
