"one thing , however , he felt that it had done for him . it had made him conscious how unjust , how cruel , he had been to sibyl vane . it was not too late to make reparation for that . she could still be his wife . his unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence , would be transformed into some nobler passion , and the portrait that basil hallward had painted of him would be a guide to him through life , would be to him what holiness is to some , and conscience to others , and the fear of god to us all . there were opiates for remorse , drugs that could lull the moral sense to sleep . but here was a visible symbol of the degradation of sin . here was an ever - present sign of the ruin men brought upon their souls .",150

"then he turned his attention to embroideries and to the tapestries that performed the office of frescoes in the chill rooms of the northern nations of europe . as he investigated the subject-- and he always had an extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the moment in whatever he took up -- he was almost saddened by the reflection of the ruin that time brought on beautiful and wonderful things . he , at any rate , had escaped that . summer followed summer , and the yellow jonquils bloomed and died many times , and nights of horror repeated the story of their shame , but he was unchanged . no winter marred his face or stained his flowerlike bloom .",62
