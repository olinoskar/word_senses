all their attempts were useless .,4
""" it seems a singularly useless thing to steal , "" said sherlock holmes . "" i confess that i share dr . mortimer 's belief that it will not be long before the missing boot is found . """,5
""" good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific laws . their origin is pure vanity . their result is absolutely nil . they give us , now and then , some of those luxurious sterile emotions that have a certain charm for the weak . that is all that can be said for them . they are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they have no account . """,4
""" that last order is useless , "" interrupted d’artagnan ; "" there are loaded pistols in your holsters . """,5
"it was useless to contemplate removing him to granite house , for he had expressed his wish to remain in the midst of those marvels of the "" nautilus "" which millions could not have purchased , and to wait there for that death which was swiftly approaching .",2
""" our lighting equipment would be useless to us , "" the captain answered me . "" we wo n't be going very deep , and the sun 's rays will be sufficient to light our way . besides , it 's unwise to carry electric lanterns under these waves . their brightness might unexpectedly attract certain dangerous occupants of these waterways .

""" yes , "" murmured lord henry , settling his button - hole in his coat ; "" and when they grow older they know it . but i do n't want money . it is only people who pay their bills who want that , uncle george , and i never pay mine . credit is the capital of a younger son , and one lives charmingly upon it . besides , i always deal with dartmoor 's tradesmen , and consequently they never bother me . what i want is information : not useful information , of course ; useless information .

""" very good , sir . you know that a visa is useless , and that no passport is required ? """,12
"instead of living for , in , and with yourself , as a reasonable being ought , you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some other person 's strength : if no one can be found willing to burden her or himself with such a fat , weak , puffy , useless thing , you cry out that you are ill - treated , neglected , miserable . then , too , existence for you must be a scene of continual change and excitement , or else the world is a dungeon : you must be admired , you must be courted , you must be flattered -- you must have music , dancing , and society -- or you languish , you die away .",52
"mr . fogg and his servant went ashore at aden to have the passport again visaed ; fix , unobserved , followed them . the visa procured , mr . fogg returned on board to resume his former habits ; while passepartout , according to custom , sauntered about among the mixed population of somalis , banyans , parsees , jews , arabs , and europeans who comprise the twenty - five thousand inhabitants of aden . he gazed with wonder upon the fortifications which make this place the gibraltar of the indian ocean , and the vast cisterns where the english engineers were still at work , two thousand years after the engineers of solomon . "" very curious , very curious , "" said passepartout to himself , on returning to the steamer . "" i see that it is by no means useless to travel , if a man wants to see something new . """,145
"phileas fogg had not concealed from sir francis his design of going round the world , nor the circumstances under which he set out ; and the general only saw in the wager a useless eccentricity and a lack of sound common sense . in the way this strange gentleman was going on , he would leave the world without having done any good to himself or anybody else .",34
"after that , i stopped objecting and started obeying , since resistance was useless .",13
why could i never please ? why was it useless to try to win any one 's favour ?,9
""" a useless observation , "" said spilett .",2
"mr . mason obeyed , because it was evidently useless to resist .",9
"it was to be regretted that the brig 's two boats had not been saved ; but one , as has been said , had gone to pieces at the mouth of the mercy , and was absolutely useless ; the other had disappeared when the brig went down , and had not again been seen , having doubtless been crushed .",38
"when i took leave of this island , i carried on board , for relics , the great goat - skin cap i had made , my umbrella , and one of my parrots ; also , i forgot not to take the money i formerly mentioned , which had lain by me so long useless that it was grown rusty or tarnished , and could hardly pass for silver till it had been a little rubbed and handled , as also the money i found in the wreck of the spanish ship . and thus i left the island , the 19th of december , as i found by the ship ’s account , in the year 1686 , after i had been upon it eight - and - twenty years , two months , and nineteen days ; being delivered from this second captivity the same day of the month that i first made my escape in the long - boat from among the moors of sallee . in this vessel , after a long voyage , i arrived in england the 11th of june , in the year 1687 , having been thirty - five years absent .",55
"remain , then , where you are , and do not exhaust yourselves with useless fatigue .",14
"in the meantime , when nothing remained of the brig but a useless hulk , bad weather came on , which soon finished her .",12
"herbert tried to console him by observing , that if they had found the matches , they would , very likely , have been wetted by the sea and useless .",29
"last january , rid of all mistresses -- in a harsh , bitter frame of mind , the result of a useless , roving , lonely life -- corroded with disappointment , sourly disposed against all men , and especially against all womankind ( for i began to regard the notion of an intellectual , faithful , loving woman as a mere dream ) , recalled by business , i came back to england .",21
