""" it is possible that stapleton did not know of the existence of an heir in canada . in any case he would very soon learn it from his friend dr . mortimer , and he was told by the latter all details about the arrival of henry baskerville . stapleton 's first idea was that this young stranger from canada might possibly be done to death in london without coming down to devonshire at all . he distrusted his wife ever since she had refused to help him in laying a trap for the old man , and he dared not leave her long out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her . it was for this reason that he took her to london with him . they lodged , i find , at the mexborough private hotel , in craven street , which was actually one of those called upon by my agent in search of evidence . here he kept his wife imprisoned in her room while he , disguised in a beard , followed dr . mortimer to baker street and afterwards to the station and to the northumberland hotel . his wife had some inkling of his plans ; but she had such a fear of her husband -- a fear founded upon brutal ill - treatment -- that she dare not write to warn the man whom she knew to be in danger . if the letter should fall into stapleton 's hands her own life would not be safe . eventually , as we know , she adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would form the message , and addressing the letter in a disguised hand . it reached the baronet , and gave him the first warning of his danger .",217

""" i , sir ! "" replied the man of letters , "" i think no such thing , i assure you ; i find that all in this world is set the wrong end uppermost . no one knows what is his rank , his office , nor what he does , nor what he should do . with the exception of our evenings , which we generally pass tolerably merrily , the rest of our time is spent in idle disputes and quarrels , jansenists against molinists , the parliament against the church , and one armed body of men against another ; courtier against courtier , husband against wife , and relations against relations . in short , this world is nothing but one continued scene of civil war . """,109
"the woman 's story hung coherently together , and all my questions were unable to shake it . i could only check it by finding if she had , indeed , instituted divorce proceedings against her husband at or about the time of the tragedy .",36
"you are sensible , sir , how dangerous it was for an ill - natured woman to be married to a physician . incensed at the behavior of his wife , he one day gave her so affectionate a remedy for a slight cold she had caught that she died in less than two hours in most dreadful convulsions . her relations prosecuted the husband , who was obliged to fly , and i was sent to prison .",64
""" that is one of the points upon which your own researches have shed a light . your interview with the lady has cleared the situation very much . i did not know about a projected divorce between herself and her husband . in that case , regarding stapleton as an unmarried man , she counted no doubt upon becoming his wife . """,41
""" yes , "" returned sir francis , "" burned alive . and , if she were not , you can not conceive what treatment she would be obliged to submit to from her relatives . they would shave off her hair , feed her on a scanty allowance of rice , treat her with contempt ; she would be looked upon as an unclean creature , and would die in some corner , like a scurvy dog . the prospect of so frightful an existence drives these poor creatures to the sacrifice much more than love or religious fanaticism . sometimes , however , the sacrifice is really voluntary , and it requires the active interference of the government to prevent it . several years ago , when i was living at bombay , a young widow asked permission of the governor to be burned along with her husband 's body ; but , as you may imagine , he refused . the woman left the town , took refuge with an independent rajah , and there carried out her self - devoted purpose .

""" the circumstances connected with the death of sir charles can not be said to have been entirely cleared up by the inquest , but at least enough has been done to dispose of those rumours to which local superstition has given rise . there is no reason whatever to suspect foul play , or to imagine that death could be from any but natural causes . sir charles was a widower , and a man who may be said to have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind . in spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his personal tastes , and his indoor servants at baskerville hall consisted of a married couple named barrymore , the husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper . their evidence , corroborated by that of several friends , tends to show that sir charles 's health has for some time been impaired , and points especially to some affection of the heart , manifesting itself in changes of colour , breathlessness , and acute attacks of nervous depression . dr . james mortimer , the friend and medical attendant of the deceased , has given evidence to the same effect .",123
"when they had a little recovered themselves , i heard her say to her husband , ' my dear , how could you think of dissecting a heretic ? do n't you know that the devil is always in them ? i 'll run directly to a priest to come and drive the evil spirit out . '",14
they say she had nearly burnt her husband in his bed once : but i do n't know about that .,7
