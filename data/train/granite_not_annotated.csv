"besides , cyrus harding never allowed a week to pass without going to see him , and ayrton came from time to time to granite house , where he always found a cordial welcome .",24
"cyrus harding informed ayrton of the projected expedition , and proposed that he should take part in it , but ayrton preferring to remain on shore , it was decided that he should come to granite house during the absence of his companions .",35
"no granite cliff , no rocks , not even a sandy beach .",1
"the engineer was somewhat uneasy on account of the dockyard shed -- which besides , he could not have established in any other place near to granite house -- for the islet only imperfectly sheltered the shore from the fury of the open sea , and in great storms the waves beat against the very foot of the granite cliff .",58
"i attach a print of the positive . in it you can view these primordial rocks that have never seen the light of day , this nether granite that forms the powerful foundation of our globe , the deep caves cut into the stony mass , the outlines of incomparable distinctness whose far edges stand out in black as if from the brush of certain flemish painters . in the distance is a mountainous horizon , a wondrously undulating line that makes up the background of this landscape . the general effect of these smooth rocks is indescribable : black , polished , without moss or other blemish , carved into strange shapes , sitting firmly on a carpet of sand that sparkled beneath our streams of electric light .",27
""" but , "" observed herbert , "" from claw cape to granite house there must be at least another ten miles .",12
"but then , what splendid fires blazed continually on the hearths of granite house , the smoke marking the granite wall with long , zebra - like streaks !",19
""" we did not leave granite house , "" answered cyrus harding , "" and if a fire appeared on the coast , it was lighted by another hand than ours ! """,5
"they then ascended to granite house , when they were always ready to go to bed .",4
"herbert proceeded as he was accustomed to do , and the negative obtained , he went away to fix it by means of the chemicals deposited in a dark nook of granite house .",31
"we had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from the road and wound away across the moor . a steep , boulder - sprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone days been cut into a granite quarry . the face which was turned towards us formed a dark cliff , with ferns and brambles growing in its niches . from over a distant rise there floated a gray plume of smoke .",43
""" it is a wonderful place , the moor , "" said he , looking round over the undulating downs , long green rollers , with crests of jagged granite foaming up into fantastic surges . "" you never tire of the moor . you can not think the wonderful secrets which it contains . it is so vast , and so barren , and so mysterious . """,29
"as soon as the first gleam of light appeared in the east , the colonists , suitably armed , repaired to the beach under granite house .",24
""" let us try to enter granite house by the old opening at the lake , "" replied the engineer .",6
"while they were thus occupied , their companions went to the border of jacamar wood , and brought back a large quantity of branches and creepers , which would at some distance appear as natural foliage , and thus disguise the windows in the granite cliff .",44
it was eight o'clock in the morning . we had four hours to ourselves before the sun could be productively observed . i guided our steps toward a huge bay that made a crescent - shaped incision in the granite cliffs along the beach .,39
""" certainly , "" said pencroft , "" a beast of burden would be very useful to us until the captain has made a steam cart , or even an engine , for some day we shall have a railroad from granite house to port balloon , with a branch line to mount franklin ! """,41
"it was useless to contemplate removing him to granite house , for he had expressed his wish to remain in the midst of those marvels of the "" nautilus "" which millions could not have purchased , and to wait there for that death which was swiftly approaching .",8
"judge then of the pleasure master jup gave to the inhabitants of granite house when , without their having had any idea of it , he appeared one day , napkin on his arm , ready to wait at table .",12
neb and pencroft immediately ascended to granite house and brought back a sufficient quantity of ammunition .,6
5000 / 15 = 333.3 from which it was proved that the granite cliff measured 333 feet in height .,12
"indeed , on the 2nd , peals of thunder were heard , the wind blew from the east , and hail rattled against the facade of granite house like volleys of grape - shot .",26
"the colonists , not having any pressing work out of doors , profited by the bad weather to work at the interior of granite house , the arrangement of which was becoming more complete from day to day .",23
"indeed , how could he imagine that a dwelling was hollowed out , at that height , in the solid granite ?",20
""" you once spoke of an apparatus which would take the place of the long ladders at granite house , captain , "" said he ; "" wo n't you make it some day ? """,17
"top particularly was enchanted with this improvement , for he had not , and never could have possessed master jup 's skill in climbing ladders , and often it was on neb 's back , or even on that of the orang that he had been obliged to make the ascent to granite house .",52
""" it is evident , "" i cried , "" the marine deposits formed in the second period , these shales , limestones , and sandstones . we are turning away from the primary granite . we are just as if we were people of hamburg going to l√ºbeck by way of hanover ! """,34
"cyrus harding , the reporter , and herbert , after spending an hour on the plateau of prospect heights , again descended to the beach , and returned to granite house .",29
""" hear me to the end , "" the professor went on with a firm voice . "" whilst you were lying there motionless , i went to examine the conformation of that gallery . it penetrates directly downward , and in a few hours it will bring us to the granite rocks . there we must meet with abundant springs . the nature of the rock assures me of this , and instinct agrees with logic to support my conviction . now , this is my proposal . when columbus asked of his ships ' crews for three days more to discover a new world , those crews , disheartened and sick as they were , recognised the justice of the claim , and he discovered america . i am the columbus of this nether world , and i only ask for one more day . if in a single day i have not met with the water that we want , i swear to you we will return to the surface of the earth .

"a handle was fixed to the first lump , and was used as a hammer to forge the second on a granite anvil , and thus they obtained a coarse but useful metal .",21
"the blubber , cut in parallel slices of two feet and a half in thickness , then divided into pieces which might weigh about a thousand pounds each , was melted down in large earthen pots brought to the spot , for they did not wish to taint the environs of granite house , and in this fusion it lost nearly a third of its weight .",51
""" that is true , cyrus , "" replied the reporter , "" but we have already examined all that mass of granite , and there is not a hole , not a cranny ! """,22
"the grotto was an immense apartment . along its granite floor ran our faithful stream . at this distance from its spring the water was scarcely tepid , and we drank of it with pleasure .",9
"they had abandoned granite house , and would not even take shelter at the chimneys , but encamped under a tent , near the mouth of the mercy .",3
"as to the guns obtained from the brig , they were pretty pieces of ordnance , which , at pencroft 's entreaty , were hoisted by means of tackle and pulleys , right up into granite house ; embrasures were made between the windows , and the shining muzzles of the guns could soon be seen through the granite cliff .",58
""" no , "" i said , "" no ; it is not through such a mass that a voice can be heard . i am surrounded by granite walls , and the loudest explosion could never be heard here ! this noise comes along the gallery . there must be here some remarkable exercise of acoustic laws ! """,28

he was gently drawn up to granite house .,6
"happily some projections of the granite , forming regular steps , made the descent less perilous .",5
"we were in reality shut up inside an immeasurable excavation . its width could not be estimated , since the shore ran widening as far as eye could reach , nor could its length , for the dim horizon bounded the new . as for its height , it must have been several leagues . where this vault rested upon its granite base no eye could tell ; but there was a cloud hanging far above , the height of which we estimated at 12,000 feet , a greater height than that of any terrestrial vapour , and no doubt due to the great density of the air .",61
""" here is the lower jaw of a mastodon , "" [ 1 ] i said . "" these are the molar teeth of the deinotherium ; this femur must have belonged to the greatest of those beasts , the megatherium . it certainly is a menagerie , for these remains were not brought here by a deluge . the animals to which they belonged roamed on the shores of this subterranean sea , under the shade of those arborescent trees . here are entire skeletons . and yet i can not understand the appearance of these quadrupeds in a granite cavern .

""" then , pencroft , "" said herbert , "" would it not be wisest to bring the ' bonadventure ' off to granite house ? """,23
she alone had hollowed this fairy alhambra in a mass of granite .,11
""" oh , i am not going to dive head foremost . but if all oceans are properly speaking but lakes , since they are encompassed by land , of course this internal sea will be surrounded by a coast of granite , and on the opposite shores we shall find fresh passages opening . """,41
"he went to the beach , and as the pickaxe when it escaped from the hands of the reporter must have fallen perpendicularly to the foot of the cliff , the finding it would be sufficient to show the place where the hole had been pierced in the granite .",48
this point abutted on the shore in a grotesque outline of high granite rocks .,12
"the second level was separated by a perpendicular granite cliff , terminated at the top by an unequal edge at a height of at least 300 feet .",8
""" what ! ca n't we carry him to granite house ? "" asked pencroft .",9
"however , at the mouth of the watercourse and above the reach of the high tide , the convulsions of nature had formed , not a grotto , but a pile of enormous rocks , such as are often met with in granite countries and which bear the name of "" chimneys . """,42
"as to leaving pencroft and herbert here alone , we could not do it ! well , i will go alone to granite house . """,22

at six we were afoot . the moment drew near to clear a way by blasting through the opposing mass of granite .,21
"captain nemo went in . we followed him . my eyes soon grew accustomed to this comparative gloom . i distinguished the unpredictably contoured springings of a vault , supported by natural pillars firmly based on a granite foundation , like the weighty columns of tuscan architecture . why had our incomprehensible guide taken us into the depths of this underwater crypt ? i would soon find out .",37
"i approached this phenomenal mollusk . its mass of filaments attached it to a table of granite , and there it grew by itself in the midst of the cave 's calm waters . i estimated the weight of this giant clam at 300 kilograms . hence such an oyster held fifteen kilos of meat , and you 'd need the stomach of king gargantua to eat a couple dozen .",16
"several times , one or other of the settlers descended to the beach in the midst of ice which the waves heaped up at each tide , but they soon climbed up again to granite house , and it was not without pain and difficulty that their hands could hold to the rounds of the ladder .",34
"besides , it might be supposed that in all probability either the convicts knew of the return of the settlers to granite house , by having seen them pass on the road from the corral , or , after the devastation of the plateau , they had penetrated into jacamar wood , following the course of the mercy , and were thus ignorant of their return .",21
it was also decided that no one should remain at granite house .,10
"not wishing to trouble him by their presence , and thus imposing on him the necessity of saying farewells which might perhaps be painful to him , they had left him alone and ascended to granite house .",35
