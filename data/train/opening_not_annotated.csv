"at length she heard the grating of the hinges of the opening gates ; the noise of boots and spurs resounded on the stairs . there was a great murmur of voices which continued to draw near , amid which she seemed to hear her own name pronounced .",11
"at the moment he went out a piercing glance darted through the opening of the nearly closed door , and she perceived felton , who drew quickly to one side to prevent being seen by her .",12
""" see , "" he went on , both asking the questions and supplying the answers . "" is n't it a beauty ? yes ; splendid ! did you ever see such a binding ? does n't the book open easily ? yes ; it stops open anywhere . but does it shut equally well ? yes ; for the binding and the leaves are flush , all in a straight line , and no gaps or openings anywhere . and look at its back , after seven hundred years . why , bozerian , closs , or purgold might have been proud of such a binding ! """,78
"the situation was indeed dangerous , but as if by magic , the nautilus seemed to glide right down the middle of these rampaging reefs . it did n't follow the exact course of the zealous and the new astrolabe , which had proved so ill - fated for captain dumont d'urville . it went more to the north , hugged the murray islands , and returned to the southwest near cumberland passage . i thought it was about to charge wholeheartedly into this opening , but it went up to the northwest , through a large number of little - known islands and islets , and steered toward tound island and the bad channel .",84
"by midnight our mining preparations were over ; the charge was rammed into the hole , and the slow match uncoiled along the gallery showed its end outside the opening .",29
"the colonists first visited the valley opening to the south of the volcano , and which first received the waters of falls river .",6
the opening which it had made was so large that the volume of water which escaped through this new outlet was at least treble that which before passed through the old one .,1
"on each side of the choir and behind the gratings opening into the convent was assembled the whole community of the carmelites , who listened to the divine service , and mingled their chant with the chant of the priests , without seeing the profane , or being seen by them .",10
"there she made a fresh sign of silence , and opened a second door concealed by tapestry . the opening of this door disclosed a brilliant light , and she disappeared .",19
"athos went close to it , and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an interest that he made a sign to his friends to be silent , remaining himself bent with his ear directed to the opening of the lower orifice .",39
"a phase of my life was closing to - night , a new one opening to - morrow : impossible to slumber in the interval ; i must watch feverishly while the change was being accomplished .",14
"this stream of electricity dazzled my eyes , and after momentarily shutting them , i looked around . the nautilus was stationary . it was floating next to an embankment shaped like a wharf . as for the water now buoying the ship , it was a lake completely encircled by an inner wall about two miles in diameter , hence six miles around . its level -- as indicated by the pressure gauge -- would be the same as the outside level , because some connection had to exist between this lake and the sea . slanting inward over their base , these high walls converged to form a vault shaped like an immense upside - down funnel that measured 500 or 600 meters in height . at its summit there gaped the circular opening through which i had detected that faint glimmer , obviously daylight .",135
"now , to raise this level they had only to establish a dam at the two openings made by the lake , and by which were fed creek glycerine and falls river .",16
"it appeared however to milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening . but whether this was reality or vision , he had this time sufficient self - command not to enter .",38
""" in all likelihood , conseil , because some convulsion created an opening below the surface of the ocean , the opening that serves as a passageway for the nautilus . then the waters of the atlantic rushed inside the mountain . there ensued a dreadful struggle between the elements of fire and water , a struggle ending in king neptune 's favor . but many centuries have passed since then , and this submerged volcano has changed into a peaceful cavern . """,12
"at thirty - three minutes past two he heard a singular noise outside , then a hasty opening of doors . passepartout 's voice was audible , and immediately after that of fix . phileas fogg 's eyes brightened for an instant .",17
the torches were held over the opening : nothing could be seen .,6
""" no doubt ; and there is a geological explanation of the fact . at a certain period the earth consisted only of an elastic crust or bark , alternately acted on by forces from above or below , according to the laws of attraction and gravitation . probably there were subsidences of the outer crust , when a portion of the sedimentary deposits was carried down sudden openings . """,68
"they took advantage of the opening already made on their last excursion to form a practicable road , which they named the far west road , and the trees were carried to the chimneys , where the dockyard was established .",5
""" oh , i am not going to dive head foremost . but if all oceans are properly speaking but lakes , since they are encompassed by land , of course this internal sea will be surrounded by a coast of granite , and on the opposite shores we shall find fresh passages opening . """,53
"the smoke from the fireplace was also driven back through the opening , filling the passages and rendering them uninhabitable .",11
some rock pigeons were already flying in and out of the narrow opening ; they evidently thought that granite house had been discovered on purpose for them .,12
"help , help ! "" screamed she , turning towards the wall , as if she would tear an opening with her hands .",19
"dâ€™artagnan had run , sword in hand , through all the neighboring streets , but had found nobody resembling the man he sought for . then he came back to the point where , perhaps , he ought to have begun , and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had leaned ; but this proved useless -- for though he knocked ten or twelve times in succession , no one answered , and some of the neighbors , who put their noses out of their windows or were brought to their doors by the noise , had assured him that that house , all the openings of which were tightly closed , had not been inhabited for six months .",110
""" primo , the cyclostomes , whose jaws are fused into a flexible ring and whose gill openings are simply a large number of holes , an order consisting of only one family . example : the lamprey . """,17
""" tertio , "" conseil replied , "" the sturionians , whose gill opening is the usual single slit adorned with a gill cover , an order consisting of four genera . example : the sturgeon . """,13
"the two friends -- for they were such -- no longer prowled round the opening of the inner well , nor did they bark or whine in that singular way which from the first the engineer had noticed .",14
"he was awaiting one of two events , either the appearance of a vertical well opening before his feet , down which our descent might be resumed , or that of some obstacle which should effectually turn us back on our own footsteps . but evening came and neither wish was gratified .",15
""" but the papers announced the opening of the railway throughout . """,6
"besides , from the shape of the crater -- the opening broken in the upper edge -- the matter would be thrown to the side opposite the fertile regions of the island .",10
"at any rate , the opening on the northeast , which was partly visible , poured out no torrent upon the northern slope of the mountain .",5
"gideon spilett had very artistically arranged on the rocky projections around the windows plants of different kinds , as well as long streaming grass , so that the openings were picturesquely framed in green , which had a pleasing effect .",28
"god doubtless neither heard nor saw me , and i sank upon the floor a prey to a slumber which resembled death . "" of all that passed in that sleep , or the time which glided away while it lasted , i have no remembrance . the only thing i recollect is that i awoke in bed in a round chamber , the furniture of which was sumptuous , and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the ceiling . no door gave entrance to the room . it might be called a magnificent prison .",78
""" we needed a locker , and now we have one , "" said pencroft ; "" but as we can not lock it up , it will be prudent to hide the opening .",33
"however , the sailor thought that by stopping - up some of the openings with a mixture of stones and sand , the chimneys could be rendered habitable .",13
"it will be so , if we can make a fireplace in the left passage and keep an opening for the smoke . """,18
"the same noise of a door opening and shutting was repeated the instant afterward ; the flaming globe descended afresh , and i was completely alone .",6
"it was not enough to reach the walls ; an opening in them must be accomplished , and to attain this purpose the party only had their pocket - knives . happily the temple walls were built of brick and wood , which could be penetrated with little difficulty ; after one brick had been taken out , the rest would yield easily .",10
"one narrow and winding opening at the side was kept , to lead out the smoke and to make the fire draw .",4
""" let us try to enter granite house by the old opening at the lake , "" replied the engineer .",11
"the nautilus 's nets hauled up several types of sea turtle from the hawksbill genus with arching backs whose scales are highly prized . diving easily , these reptiles can remain a good while underwater by closing the fleshy valves located at the external openings of their nasal passages . when they were captured , some hawksbills were still asleep inside their carapaces , a refuge from other marine animals . the flesh of these turtles was nothing memorable , but their eggs made an excellent feast .",44
"the opening was , it is true , closed up with a wall of cemented stones , which it would be necessary to sacrifice , but that could easily be rebuilt .",1
"fortunately , cyrus harding had not as yet effected his project of hiding this opening by raising the waters of the lake , for the operation would then have taken some time .",14
"this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation . alice replied , rather shyly , ' i -- i hardly know , sir , just at present-- at least i know who i was when i got up this morning , but i think i must have been changed several times since then . '",5
