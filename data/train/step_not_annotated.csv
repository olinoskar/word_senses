"he was so exact that he was never in a hurry , was always ready , and was economical alike of his steps and his motions . he never took one step too many , and always went to his destination by the shortest cut ; he made no superfluous gestures , and was never seen to be moved or agitated . he was the most deliberate person in the world , yet always reached his destination at the exact moment . he lived alone , and , so to speak , outside of every social relation ; and as he knew that in this world account must be taken of friction , and that friction retards , he never rubbed against anybody .",22

"my first impulse was to tell sir henry all my plans . my second and wisest one is to play my own game and speak as little as possible to anyone . he is silent and distrait . his nerves have been strangely shaken by that sound upon the moor . i will say nothing to add to his anxieties , but i will take my own steps to attain my own end .",67

"immediately the aldermen , clothed in their cloth robes and preceded by six sergeants , each holding a flambeau in his hand , went to attend upon the king , whom they met on the steps , where the provost of the merchants made him the speech of welcome -- a compliment to which his majesty replied with an apology for coming so late , laying the blame upon the cardinal , who had detained him till eleven o’clock , talking of affairs of state .",35
"ayrton then , followed by pencroft , crossed it with a rapid step , scaring the birds nestled in the holes of the rocks ; then , without hesitating , he plunged into the sea , and swam noiselessly in the direction of the ship , in which a few lights had recently appeared , showing her exact situation .",12

"i crept forward through the nautilus 's dark gangways , pausing after each step to curb the pounding of my heart . i arrived at the corner door of the lounge . i opened it gently . the lounge was plunged in profound darkness . chords from the organ were reverberating faintly . captain nemo was there . he did n't see me . even in broad daylight i doubt that he would have noticed me , so completely was he immersed in his trance .",13

"stepping ashore had an exhilarating effect on me . ned land tested the soil with his foot , as if he were laying claim to it . yet it had been only two months since we had become , as captain nemo expressed it , "" passengers on the nautilus , "" in other words , the literal prisoners of its commander .",0

"faithful to his mission of vengeance , athos had requested to be conducted to the garden ; and there upon the sand following the light steps of this woman , who left sharp tracks wherever she went , he advanced toward the gate which led into the wood , and causing it to be opened , he went out into the forest .",25

"the sails and the english flag were hoisted at ten minutes past three . mr . fogg and aouda , who were seated on deck , cast a last glance at the quay , in the hope of espying passepartout . fix was not without his fears lest chance should direct the steps of the unfortunate servant , whom he had so badly treated , in this direction ; in which case an explanation the reverse of satisfactory to the detective must have ensued . but the frenchman did not appear , and , without doubt , was still lying under the stupefying influence of the opium .",52
"but , however short was my examination of this well , i had taken some account of its conformation . its almost perpendicular walls were bristling with innumerable projections which would facilitate the descent . but if there was no want of steps , still there was no rail . a rope fastened to the edge of the aperture might have helped us down . but how were we to unfasten it , when arrived at the other end ?",42
"a valet , of stealthy step , thence conducted me , in silence , through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master .",5

"it would have taken the settlers four hours to do this , on a clear ground and without hurrying themselves ; but as it was they needed double the time , for what with trees to go round , bushes to cut down , and creepers to chop away , they were impeded at every step , these obstacles greatly lengthening their journey .",55
""" do i look so ? "" asked the baron , rising and going a step backward .",15
"milady remained alone , with her eyes fixed upon the door . an instant later , the jingling of spurs was heard upon the stairs , steps drew near , the door opened , and a man appeared .",26
the old gentleman growled approvingly and rang the bell for his servant . lord henry passed up the low arcade into burlington street and turned his steps in the direction of berkeley square .,26
"i was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences , when i bethought myself to open the window and step out on to the balcony .",25
"it was necessary to make the journey in five hours and a half ; and this would have been easy on a clear road throughout . but there were forced delays , and when mr . fogg stepped from the train at the terminus , all the clocks in london were striking ten minutes before nine .",37
athos did not leave his chamber ; he made up his mind not to take a single step to equip himself .,17
he who at the moment occupied the upper step kept his adversaries marvelously in check .,8
"there followed between these two personages a strange silence , during which the sound of a slow and regular step was heard approaching . shortly a human form appeared in the shade of the corridor , and the young lieutenant , with whom we are already acquainted , stopped at the threshold to receive the orders of the baron .",19
"he chose a straight young fir , with no knots , and which he had only to square at the step , and round off at the top .",20
"the moon was set , and it was very dark ; bessie carried a lantern , whose light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw . raw and chill was the winter morning : my teeth chattered as i hastened down the drive .",21
"he recalled , all at once , the warnings of lord de winter , the seductions of milady , her first attempts after her arrival . he drew back a step , and hung down his head , without , however , ceasing to look at her , as if , fascinated by this strange creature , he could not detach his eyes from her eyes .",30
"besides , the appearance of the caravan was formidable . the black horses of the musketeers , their martial carriage , with the regimental step of these noble companions of the soldier , would have betrayed the most strict incognito .",24
"on their part , the french , on seeing the four friends return at such a step , uttered cries of enthusiasm .",16
"one instant after , the heavy step of a marine who served as sentinel was heard in the corridor -- his ax in his girdle and his musket on his shoulder .",6
a sensation of stupor oppressed me as my eyes followed her retreating steps .,12
"when she was only about three steps from him , he turned his head round , fixing his eyes steadfastly upon the lady with the red cushion , who had risen and was approaching , followed by her black boy and her woman .",6
"the worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat as hearty a breakfast as possible before leaving the carnatic ; but , as he had been walking about all day , the demands of hunger were becoming importunate . he observed that the butchers stalls contained neither mutton , goat , nor pork ; and , knowing also that it is a sacrilege to kill cattle , which are preserved solely for farming , he made up his mind that meat was far from plentiful in yokohama -- nor was he mistaken ; and , in default of butcher 's meat , he could have wished for a quarter of wild boar or deer , a partridge , or some quails , some game or fish , which , with rice , the japanese eat almost exclusively . but he found it necessary to keep up a stout heart , and to postpone the meal he craved till the following morning . night came , and passepartout re - entered the native quarter , where he wandered through the streets , lit by vari - coloured lanterns , looking on at the dancers , who were executing skilful steps and boundings , and the astrologers who stood in the open air with their telescopes . then he came to the harbour , which was lit up by the resin torches of the fishermen , who were fishing from their boats .",199
"i passed a tall briar , shooting leafy and flowery branches across the path ; i see the narrow stile with stone steps ; and i see -- mr . rochester sitting there , a book and a pencil in his hand ; he is writing .",22
"passepartout was not the man to let an idea go begging , and directed his steps towards the docks . but , as he approached them , his project , which at first had seemed so simple , began to grow more and more formidable to his mind . what need would they have of a cook or servant on an american steamer , and what confidence would they put in him , dressed as he was ? what references could he give ?",15
"we were still following the gallery of lava , a real natural staircase , and as gently sloping as those inclined planes which in some old houses are still found instead of flights of steps . and so we went on until 12.17 , the , precise moment when we overtook hans , who had stopped .",34
"for a minute i stood there with the paper in my hands thinking out the meaning of this curt message . it was i , then , and not sir henry , who was being dogged by this secret man . he had not followed me himself , but he had set an agent -- the boy , perhaps -- upon my track , and this was his report . possibly i had taken no step since i had been upon the moor which had not been observed and reported . always there was this feeling of an unseen force , a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and delicacy , holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme moment that one realized that one was indeed entangled in its meshes .",75
""" there , then--'off , ye lendings ! ' "" and mr . rochester stepped out of his disguise .",14
"after half an hour 's walking , on the other side of the promontory which formed the little natural harbour , i perceived hans at work . in a few more steps i was at his side . to my great surprise a half - finished raft was already lying on the sand , made of a peculiar kind of wood , and a great number of planks , straight and bent , and of frames , were covering the ground , enough almost for a little fleet .",31
"after approaching milady with a slow and solemn step , so that the table alone separated them , the unknown took off his mask .",8
""" very good , very good , "" said holmes , smiling . "" the cabman may as well help me with my boxes . just ask him to step up , wiggins . """,29
"he walked six or seven times round the place royale , turning at every ten steps to look at the light in milady ’s apartment , which was to be seen through the blinds . it was evident that this time the young woman was not in such haste to retire to her apartment as she had been the first .",15
"the hall - door , which was half of glass , stood open ; i stepped over the threshold .",15
"hearing a cautious step behind me , i glanced over my shoulder : one of the strangers -- a gentleman , evidently -- was advancing up the chancel .",3
"unhappily for his master , as well as himself , his curiosity drew him unconsciously farther off than he intended to go . at last , having seen the parsee carnival wind away in the distance , he was turning his steps towards the station , when he happened to espy the splendid pagoda on malabar hill , and was seized with an irresistible desire to see its interior . he was quite ignorant that it is forbidden to christians to enter certain indian temples , and that even the faithful must not go in without first leaving their shoes outside the door . it may be said here that the wise policy of the british government severely punishes a disregard of the practices of the native religions .",41
"the service began . the explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through ; and then the clergyman came a step further forward , and , bending slightly towards mr . rochester , went on .",21
"m de treville was at the moment in rather ill - humor , nevertheless he saluted the young man politely , who bowed to the very ground ; and he smiled on receiving d’artagnan ’s response , the bearnese accent of which recalled to him at the same time his youth and his country -- a double remembrance which makes a man smile at all ages ; but stepping toward the antechamber and making a sign to d’artagnan with his hand , as if to ask his permission to finish with others before he began with him , he called three times , with a louder voice at each time , so that he ran through the intervening tones between the imperative accent and the angry accent .",68
"but i had followed the banks of the elbe and passed the town . after passing the port too , i had reached the altona road . i was led by a presentiment , soon to be realised ; for shortly i espied my little gräuben bravely returning with her light step to hamburg .",51
"i see trees laden with ripening fruit . i hear a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off ; no moving form is visible , no coming step audible ; but that perfume increases : i must flee .",29
"i make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery , and i see mr . rochester entering . i step aside into the ivy recess ; he will not stay long : he will soon return whence he came , and if i sit still he will never see me .",19
"at a hundred paces from the gates of calais , d’artagnan ’s horse gave out , and could not by any means be made to get up again , the blood flowing from his eyes and his nose . there still remained planchet ’s horse ; but he stopped short , and could not be made to move a step .",59
"at each step , as it were , that the explorers made , fresh stars entered the field of their vision .",2
"athos availed himself of the permission , ascended the stairs with his lightest step , gained the landing , and through the open door perceived milady putting on her hat .",13
"in this dilemma , as i was very pensive , i stepped into the cabin and sat down , xury having the helm ; when , on a sudden , the boy cried out , “ master , master , a ship with a sail ! ” and the foolish boy was frighted out of his wits , thinking it must needs be some of his master ’s ships sent to pursue us , but i knew we were far enough out of their reach . i jumped out of the cabin , and immediately saw , not only the ship , but that it was a portuguese ship ; and , as i thought , was bound to the coast of guinea , for negroes . but , when i observed the course she steered , i was soon convinced they were bound some other way , and did not design to come any nearer to the shore ; upon which i stretched out to sea as much as i could , resolving to speak with them if possible .",11
"the general at once stepped out , while phileas fogg calmly followed him , and they proceeded together to the conductor .",4

"arrived at this point the settlers retraced their steps , and at nightfall entered the chimneys ; but they did not sleep before the question of knowing whether they could think of leaving lincoln island or not was definitely settled .",8
"after having passed the precipice , herbert , the reporter , and pencroft prudently stepped aside to stop and take breath .",14

"he had not proceeded two hundred steps , however , when , "" by the greatest chance in the world , "" he met fix . the detective seemed wholly taken by surprise . what ! had mr . fogg and himself crossed the pacific together , and not met on the steamer ! at least fix felt honoured to behold once more the gentleman to whom he owed so much , and , as his business recalled him to europe , he should be delighted to continue the journey in such pleasant company .",6
"just at this moment there was an unusual stir in the human mass . all the hands were raised in the air . some , tightly closed , seemed to disappear suddenly in the midst of the cries -- an energetic way , no doubt , of casting a vote . the crowd swayed back , the banners and flags wavered , disappeared an instant , then reappeared in tatters . the undulations of the human surge reached the steps , while all the heads floundered on the surface like a sea agitated by a squall . many of the black hats disappeared , and the greater part of the crowd seemed to have diminished in height .",79
"he roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried , unequal , and objectless step .",13
"anxiety hastened his steps , for he longed to obtain news of his friend , and he soon disappeared round an angle of the cliff .",3
"aouda , leaning upon mr . fogg 's arm , observed the tumultuous scene with surprise , while fix asked a man near him what the cause of it all was . before the man could reply , a fresh agitation arose ; hurrahs and excited shouts were heard ; the staffs of the banners began to be used as offensive weapons ; and fists flew about in every direction . thumps were exchanged from the tops of the carriages and omnibuses which had been blocked up in the crowd . boots and shoes went whirling through the air , and mr . fogg thought he even heard the crack of revolvers mingling in the din , the rout approached the stairway , and flowed over the lower step . one of the parties had evidently been repulsed ; but the mere lookers - on could not tell whether mandiboy or camerfield had gained the upper hand .",128
"he ran forward , then returned , and seemed to entreat them to hasten their steps .",15
"i had taken but few turns in this manner , when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention .",13
"a group of old fakirs were capering and making a wild ado round the statue ; these were striped with ochre , and covered with cuts whence their blood issued drop by drop -- stupid fanatics , who , in the great indian ceremonies , still throw themselves under the wheels of juggernaut . some brahmins , clad in all the sumptuousness of oriental apparel , and leading a woman who faltered at every step , followed . this woman was young , and as fair as a european . her head and neck , shoulders , ears , arms , hands , and toes were loaded down with jewels and gems with bracelets , earrings , and rings ; while a tunic bordered with gold , and covered with a light muslin robe , betrayed the outline of her form .",74
"and at these words , the musketeer , in irreproachable costume , belted as usual , with a tolerably firm step , entered the cabinet .",20

"d’artagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek a ridiculous death in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat a single step . besides , courage was out of the question here ; d’artagnan had fallen into an ambush .",29
in one of those halts he heard the steps of several horses on the road .,8

"amidst all this , i had to listen as well as watch : to listen for the movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den . but since mr . rochester 's visit it seemed spellbound : all the night i heard but three sounds at three long intervals,--a step creak , a momentary renewal of the snarling , canine noise , and a deep human groan .",53

"by then the nautilus had returned to the surface of the waves . stationed on the top steps , one of the seamen undid the bolts of the hatch . but he had scarcely unscrewed the nuts when the hatch flew up with tremendous violence , obviously pulled open by the suckers on a devilfish 's arm .",17
"i had to follow , clutching at every step . the keen air made me giddy ; i felt the spire rocking with every gust of wind ; my knees began to fail ; soon i was crawling on my knees , then creeping on my stomach ; i closed my eyes ; i seemed to be lost in space .",8
"the bolts were drawn ; the door groaned upon its hinges . steps sounded in the chamber , and drew near .",12

"she then turned to the right , followed the course of a long corridor , descended a flight , went a few steps farther , introduced a key into a lock , opened a door , and pushed the duke into an apartment lighted only by a lamp , saying , "" remain here , my lord duke ; someone will come . """,22
"the hall , too , was scoured ; and the great carved clock , as well as the steps and banisters of the staircase , were polished to the brightness of glass ; in the dining - room , the sideboard flashed resplendent with plate ; in the drawing - room and boudoir , vases of exotics bloomed on all sides .",18
"i started moving , groping my way . after five steps i encountered an iron wall made of riveted boilerplate . then , turning around , i bumped into a wooden table next to which several stools had been set . the floor of this prison lay hidden beneath thick , hempen matting that deadened the sound of footsteps . its naked walls did n't reveal any trace of a door or window . going around the opposite way , conseil met up with me , and we returned to the middle of this cabin , which had to be twenty feet long by ten wide . as for its height , not even ned land , with his great stature , was able to determine it .",10

"we had been gone from the nautilus for about an hour and a half . it was almost noon . i spotted this fact in the perpendicularity of the sun 's rays , which were no longer refracted . the magic of these solar colors disappeared little by little , with emerald and sapphire shades vanishing from our surroundings altogether . we walked with steady steps that rang on the seafloor with astonishing intensity . the tiniest sounds were transmitted with a speed to which the ear is unaccustomed on shore . in fact , water is a better conductor of sound than air , and under the waves noises carry four times as fast .",65
"a small fly or moth had fluttered across our path , and in an instant stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it . to my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire , and my acquaintance never paused for an instant , bounding from tuft to tuft behind it , his green net waving in the air . his gray clothes and jerky , zigzag , irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself . i was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the treacherous mire , when i heard the sound of steps , and turning round found a woman near me upon the path . she had come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of merripit house , but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close .",118

"neb , herbert , and pencroft left the cave and directed their steps towards a high mound crowned with a few distorted trees .",12
"i assented gladly , and we all descended together . our prisoner made no attempt at escape , but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his , and we followed him . lestrade mounted the box , whipped up the horse , and brought us in a very short time to our destination . we were ushered into a small chamber where a police inspector noted down our prisoner 's name and the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged . the official was a white - faced unemotional man , who went through his duties in a dull mechanical way . "" the prisoner will be put before the magistrates in the course of the week , "" he said ; "" in the mean time , mr . jefferson hope , have you anything that you wish to say ? i must warn you that your words will be taken down , and may be used against you .

"but as the bushes shrank , the tree forms magnified . actual petrified thickets and long alcoves from some fantastic school of architecture kept opening up before our steps . captain nemo entered beneath a dark gallery whose gentle slope took us to a depth of 100 meters . the light from our glass coils produced magical effects at times , lingering on the wrinkled roughness of some natural arch , or some overhang suspended like a chandelier , which our lamps flecked with fiery sparks . amid these shrubs of precious coral , i observed other polyps no less unusual : melita coral , rainbow coral with jointed outgrowths , then a few tufts of genus corallina , some green and others red , actually a type of seaweed encrusted with limestone salts , which , after long disputes , naturalists have finally placed in the vegetable kingdom . but as one intellectual has remarked , "" here , perhaps , is the actual point where life rises humbly out of slumbering stone , but without breaking away from its crude starting point .

""" now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find everything else for yourself . now let me endeavour to show you the different steps in my reasoning . to begin at the beginning . i approached the house , as you know , on foot , and with my mind entirely free from all impressions . i naturally began by examining the roadway , and there , as i have already explained to you , i saw clearly the marks of a cab , which , i ascertained by inquiry , must have been there during the night . i satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels . the ordinary london growler is considerably less wide than a gentleman 's brougham .",31
"at a signal from captain nemo , one of his men stepped forward and , a few feet from this cross , detached a mattock from his belt and began to dig a hole .",11

"and yet it may seem a small matter in itself . you are aware that i am not a very sound sleeper , and since i have been on guard in this house my slumbers have been lighter than ever . last night , about two in the morning , i was aroused by a stealthy step passing my room . i rose , opened my door , and peeped out . a long black shadow was trailing down the corridor . it was thrown by a man who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in his hand . he was in shirt and trousers , with no covering to his feet . i could merely see the outline , but his height told me that it was barrymore . he walked very slowly and circumspectly , and there was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole appearance .",56
"he was masked likewise ; but i knew his step , i knew his voice , i knew him by that imposing bearing which hell has bestowed upon his person for the curse of humanity .",9

"barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against the glass . his profile was half turned towards me , and his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the moor . for some minutes he stood watching intently . then he gave a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light . instantly i made my way back to my room , and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing once more upon their return journey . long afterwards when i had fallen into a light sleep i heard a key turn somewhere in a lock , but i could not tell whence the sound came . what it all means i can not guess , but there is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of . i do not trouble you with my theories , for you asked me to furnish you only with facts . i have had a long talk with sir henry this morning , and we have made a plan of campaign founded upon my observations of last night . i will not speak about it just now , but it should make my next report interesting reading .",83

"many citizens , seeing the women flying toward the high street , leaving their children crying at the open doors , hastened to don the cuirass , and supporting their somewhat uncertain courage with a musket or a partisan , directed their steps toward the hostelry of the jolly miller , before which was gathered , increasing every minute , a compact group , vociferous and full of curiosity .",42

"callous , concentrated on evil , with stained mind , and soul hungry for rebellion , dorian gray hastened on , quickening his step as he went , but as he darted aside into a dim archway , that had served him often as a short cut to the ill - famed place where he was going , he felt himself suddenly seized from behind , and before be had time to defend himself , he was thrust back against the wall , with a brutal hand round his throat .",23
