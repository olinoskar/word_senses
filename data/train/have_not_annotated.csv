"mr . fogg had not time to stop the brave fellow , who , opening a door unperceived by the indians , succeeded in slipping under the car ; and while the struggle continued and the balls whizzed across each other over his head , he made use of his old acrobatic experience , and with amazing agility worked his way under the cars , holding on to the chains , aiding himself by the brakes and edges of the sashes , creeping from one car to another with marvellous skill , and thus gaining the forward end of the train .",3

"" a milk boy , passing on his way to the dairy , happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel . he noticed that a ladder , which usually lay there , was raised against one of the windows of the second floor , which was wide open . after passing , he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder . he came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel . he took no particular notice of him , beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him to be at work . he has an impression that the man was tall , had a reddish face , and was dressed in a long , brownish coat . he must have stayed in the room some little time after the murder , for we found blood - stained water in the basin , where he had washed his hands , and marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife .

""" nothing of any importance . the man 's novel , with which he had read himself to sleep was lying upon the bed , and his pipe was on a chair beside him . there was a glass of water on the table , and on the window - sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills . """,14

"i went downstairs and carried the dog upstair in my arms . it 's laboured breathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end . indeed , its snow - white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded the usual term of canine existence . i placed it upon a cushion on the rug .",39

"as he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and placed it in front of the terrier , who speedily licked it dry . sherlock holmes ' earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in silence , watching the animal intently , and expecting some startling effect . none such appeared , however . the dog continued to lie stretched upon the cushion , breathing in a laboured way , but apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught .",34
"holmes had taken out his watch , and as minute followed minute without result , an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared upon his features . he gnawed his lip , drummed his fingers upon the table , and showed every other symptom of acute impatience . so great was his emotion , that i felt sincerely sorry for him , while the two detectives smiled derisively , by no means displeased at this check which he had met .",79

"a practiced workman can make , without a machine , about ten thousand bricks in twelve hours ; but in their two days work the five brickmakers on lincoln island had not made more than three thousand , which were ranged near each other , until the time when their complete desiccation would permit them to be used in building the oven , that is to say , in three or four days .",30
"this game was eaten fresh , but they preserved some capybara hams , by smoking them above a fire of green wood , after having perfumed them with sweet - smelling leaves .",24
"however , this food , although very strengthening , was always roast upon roast , and the party would have been delighted to hear some soup bubbling on the hearth , but they must wait till a pot could be made , and , consequently , till the oven was built .",19
"happily the creature did not attack them , or they might not have escaped without a severe wound .",12
"they also reckoned the days they had passed on lincoln island , and from that time kept a regular account .",6
"naturally this had to be in the open air , and not in a kiln , or rather , the agglomeration of bricks made an enormous kiln , which would bake itself .",2
"the result of these different works was , that , on the 9th of april , the engineer had at his disposal a quantity of prepared lime and some thousands of bricks .",18
"we must mention here that pencroft , desirous to know if the clay thus prepared was worthy of its name of pipe - clay , made some large pipes , which he thought charming , but for which , alas ! he had no tobacco , and that was a great privation to pencroft .",42
"the settlers , having become potters , made nothing but pottery .",3
"when the wormwood was properly dried it provided them with a very inflammable substance , especially afterwards when the engineer had impregnated it with nitrate of potash , of which the island possessed several beds , and which is in truth saltpeter .",20
"they had an excellent taste , and were very nutritious , being something similar to the substance which is sold in england under the name of "" portland sago "" ; they were also a good substitute for bread , which the settlers in lincoln island did not yet possess .",1
"at the southern zenith glittered the circumpolar constellations , and above all the southern cross , which some days before the engineer had greeted on the summit of mount franklin .",22
"cyrus harding gazed for some time at this splendid constellation , which has at its summit and at its base two stars of the first magnitude , at its left arm a star of the second , and at its right arm a star of the third magnitude .",12

"but the engineer had already left the chimneys , and pencroft prepared for the seal hunt , without having received any other explanation .",18
"the hunters , armed with sticks , could have killed them easily , but they were not guilty of such useless massacre , as it was important not to frighten the seals , who were lying on the sand several cable lengths off .",8
"towards the extremity of the islet appeared great black heads floating just above the water , having exactly the appearance of rocks in motion .",16
"it was necessary , however , first to allow them to land , for with their close , short hair , and their fusiform conformation , being excellent swimmers , it is difficult to catch them in the sea , while on land their short , webbed feet prevent their having more than a slow , waddling movement .",50

cyrus harding shook his head with the air of a man who augured no good from the phenomenon whose development had been so sudden .,20

"yet even in this voyage i had my misfortunes too ; particularly , that i was continually sick , being thrown into a violent calenture by the excessive heat of the climate ; our principal trading being upon the coast , from latitude of 15 degrees north even to the line itself .",6
"here i meditated nothing but my escape , and what method i might take to effect it , but found no way that had the least probability in it ; nothing presented to make the supposition of it rational ; for i had nobody to communicate it to that would embark with me — no fellow - slave , no englishman , irishman , or scotchman there but myself ; so that for two years , though i often pleased myself with the imagination , yet i never had the least encouraging prospect of putting it in practice .",23

"it happened one time , that going a - fishing in a calm morning , a fog rose so thick that , though we were not half a league from the shore , we lost sight of it ; and rowing we knew not whither or which way , we laboured all day , and all the next night ; and when the morning came we found we had pulled off to sea instead of pulling in for the shore ; and that we were at least two leagues from the shore . however , we got well in again , though with a great deal of labour and some danger ; for the wind began to blow pretty fresh in the morning ; but we were all very hungry .",68
"i got all things ready as he had directed , and waited the next morning with the boat washed clean , her ancient and pendants out , and everything to accommodate his guests ; when by - and - by my patron came on board alone , and told me his guests had put off going from some business that fell out , and ordered me , with the man and boy , as usual , to go out with the boat and catch them some fish , for that his friends were to sup at his house , and commanded that as soon as i got some fish i should bring it home to his house ; all which i prepared to do .",7
"this moment my former notions of deliverance darted into my thoughts , for now i found i was likely to have a little ship at my command ; and my master being gone , i prepared to furnish myself , not for fishing business , but for a voyage ; though i knew not , neither did i so much as consider , whither i should steer — anywhere to get out of that place was my desire .",20
"my first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this moor , to get something for our subsistence on board ; for i told him we must not presume to eat of our patron ’s bread . he said that was true ; so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit , and three jars of fresh water , into the boat . i knew where my patron ’s case of bottles stood , which it was evident , by the make , were taken out of some english prize , and i conveyed them into the boat while the moor was on shore , as if they had been there before for our master . i conveyed also a great lump of beeswax into the boat , which weighed about half a hundred - weight , with a parcel of twine or thread , a hatchet , a saw , and a hammer , all of which were of great use to us afterwards , especially the wax , to make candles . another trick i tried upon him , which he innocently came into also : his name was ismael , which they call muley , or moely ; so i called to him—“moely , ” said i , “ our patron ’s guns are on board the boat ; can you not get a little powder and shot ? it may be we may kill some alcamies ( a fowl like our curlews ) for ourselves , for i know he keeps the gunner ’s stores in the ship . ” “ yes , ” says he , “ i ’ll bring some ; ” and accordingly he brought a great leather pouch , which held a pound and a half of powder , or rather more ; and another with shot , that had five or six pounds , with some bullets , and put all into the boat . at the same time i had found some powder of my master ’s in the great cabin , with which i filled one of the large bottles in the case , which was almost empty , pouring what was in it into another ; and thus furnished with everything needful , we sailed out of the port to fish . the castle , which is at the entrance of the port , knew who we were , and took no notice of us ; and we were not above a mile out of the port before we hauled in our sail and set us down to fish . the wind blew from the n.n.e . , which was contrary to my desire , for had it blown southerly i had been sure to have made the coast of spain , and at least reached to the bay of cadiz ; but my resolutions were , blow which way it would , i would be gone from that horrid place where i was , and leave the rest to fate .",112

"in this dilemma , as i was very pensive , i stepped into the cabin and sat down , xury having the helm ; when , on a sudden , the boy cried out , “ master , master , a ship with a sail ! ” and the foolish boy was frighted out of his wits , thinking it must needs be some of his master ’s ships sent to pursue us , but i knew we were far enough out of their reach . i jumped out of the cabin , and immediately saw , not only the ship , but that it was a portuguese ship ; and , as i thought , was bound to the coast of guinea , for negroes . but , when i observed the course she steered , i was soon convinced they were bound some other way , and did not design to come any nearer to the shore ; upon which i stretched out to sea as much as i could , resolving to speak with them if possible .",20
"they asked me what i was , in portuguese , and in spanish , and in french , but i understood none of them ; but at last a scotch sailor , who was on board , called to me : and i answered him , and told him i was an englishman , that i had made my escape out of slavery from the moors , at sallee ; they then bade me come on board , and very kindly took me in , and all my goods .",56
"as he was charitable in this proposal , so he was just in the performance to a tittle ; for he ordered the seamen that none should touch anything that i had : then he took everything into his own possession , and gave me back an exact inventory of them , that i might have them , even to my three earthen jars .",31

"the merchant in london , vesting this hundred pounds in english goods , such as the captain had written for , sent them directly to him at lisbon , and he brought them all safe to me to the brazils ; among which , without my direction ( for i was too young in my business to think of them ) , he had taken care to have all sorts of tools , ironwork , and utensils necessary for my plantation , and which were of great use to me .",67
"neither was this all ; for my goods being all english manufacture , such as cloths , stuffs , baize , and things particularly valuable and desirable in the country , i found means to sell them to a very great advantage ; so that i might say i had more than four times the value of my first cargo , and was now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour — i mean in the advancement of my plantation ; for the first thing i did , i bought me a negro slave , and an european servant also — i mean another besides that which the captain brought me from lisbon .",49

"our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons burden , carried six guns and fourteen men , besides the master , his boy , and myself . we had on board no large cargo of goods , except of such toys as were fit for our trade with the negroes , such as beads , bits of glass , shells , and other trifles , especially little looking - glasses , knives , scissors , hatchets , and the like .",29
"in this distress we had , besides the terror of the storm , one of our men die of the calenture , and one man and the boy washed overboard . about the twelfth day , the weather abating a little , the master made an observation as well as he could , and found that he was in about eleven degrees north latitude , but that he was twenty - two degrees of longitude difference west from cape st . augustino ; so that he found he was upon the coast of guiana , or the north part of brazil , beyond the river amazon , toward that of the river orinoco , commonly called the great river ; and began to consult with me what course he should take , for the ship was leaky , and very much disabled , and he was going directly back to the coast of brazil .",4
"i was positively against that ; and looking over the charts of the sea - coast of america with him , we concluded there was no inhabited country for us to have recourse to till we came within the circle of the caribbee islands , and therefore resolved to stand away for barbadoes ; which , by keeping off at sea , to avoid the indraft of the bay or gulf of mexico , we might easily perform , as we hoped , in about fifteen days ’ sail ; whereas we could not possibly make our voyage to the coast of africa without some assistance both to our ship and to ourselves .",31
"with this design we changed our course , and steered away n.w . by w. , in order to reach some of our english islands , where i hoped for relief . but our voyage was otherwise determined ; for , being in the latitude of twelve degrees eighteen minutes , a second storm came upon us , which carried us away with the same impetuosity westward , and drove us so out of the way of all human commerce , that , had all our lives been saved as to the sea , we were rather in danger of being devoured by savages than ever returning to our own country .",83
"when i came down from my apartment in the tree , i looked about me again , and the first thing i found was the boat , which lay , as the wind and the sea had tossed her up , upon the land , about two miles on my right hand . i walked as far as i could upon the shore to have got to her ; but found a neck or inlet of water between me and the boat which was about half a mile broad ; so i came back for the present , being more intent upon getting at the ship , where i hoped to find something for my present subsistence .",64

"the entrance into this place i made to be , not by a door , but by a short ladder to go over the top ; which ladder , when i was in , i lifted over after me ; and so i was completely fenced in and fortified , as i thought , from all the world , and consequently slept secure in the night , which otherwise i could not have done ; though , as it appeared afterwards , there was no need of all this caution from the enemies that i apprehended danger from .",72
"having now fixed my habitation , i found it absolutely necessary to provide a place to make a fire in , and fuel to burn : and what i did for that , and also how i enlarged my cave , and what conveniences i made , i shall give a full account of in its place ; but i must now give some little account of myself , and of my thoughts about living , which , it may well be supposed , were not a few .",0
"i confess i had not entertained any notion of my ammunition being destroyed at one blast — i mean my powder being blown up by lightning ; and this made the thoughts of it so surprising to me , when it lightened and thundered , as i observed just now .",3
"after i had been there about ten or twelve days , it came into my thoughts that i should lose my reckoning of time for want of books , and pen and ink , and should even forget the sabbath days ; but to prevent this , i cut with my knife upon a large post , in capital letters — and making it into a great cross , i set it up on the shore where i first landed—“i came on shore here on the 30th september 1659 . ” upon the sides of this square post i cut every day a notch with my knife , and every seventh notch was as long again as the rest , and every first day of the month as long again as that long one ; and thus i kept my calendar , or weekly , monthly , and yearly reckoning of time .",2
"i now began to consider seriously my condition , and the circumstances i was reduced to ; and i drew up the state of my affairs in writing , not so much to leave them to any that were to come after me — for i was likely to have but few heirs — as to deliver my thoughts from daily poring over them , and afflicting my mind ; and as my reason began now to master my despondency , i began to comfort myself as well as i could , and to set the good against the evil , that i might have something to distinguish my case from worse ; and i stated very impartially , like debtor and creditor , the comforts i enjoyed against the miseries i suffered , thus : —",49

"all the rest of the day i spent in afflicting myself at the dismal circumstances i was brought to — viz . i had neither food , house , clothes , weapon , nor place to fly to ; and in despair of any relief , saw nothing but death before me — either that i should be devoured by wild beasts , murdered by savages , or starved to death for want of food . at the approach of night i slept in a tree , for fear of wild creatures ; but slept soundly , though it rained all night .",23

"_ dec _ . 11.—this day i went to work with it accordingly , and got two shores or posts pitched upright to the top , with two pieces of boards across over each post ; this i finished the next day ; and setting more posts up with boards , in about a week more i had the roof secured , and the posts , standing in rows , served me for partitions to part off the house .",57
"_ dec . _ 27.—killed a young goat , and lamed another , so that i caught it and led it home in a string ; when i had it at home , i bound and splintered up its leg , which was broke .",28
"_ n.b._—i took such care of it that it lived , and the leg grew well and as strong as ever ; but , by my nursing it so long , it grew tame , and fed upon the little green at my door , and would not go away . this was the first time that i entertained a thought of breeding up some tame creatures , that i might have food when my powder and shot was all spent .",71
"all this time i worked very hard , the rains hindering me many days , nay , sometimes weeks together ; but i thought i should never be perfectly secure till this wall was finished ; and it is scarce credible what inexpressible labour everything was done with , especially the bringing piles out of the woods and driving them into the ground ; for i made them much bigger than i needed to have done .",74
"it was a little before the great rains just now mentioned that i threw this stuff away , taking no notice , and not so much as remembering that i had thrown anything there , when , about a month after , or thereabouts , i saw some few stalks of something green shooting out of the ground , which i fancied might be some plant i had not seen ; but i was surprised , and perfectly astonished , when , after a little longer time , i saw about ten or twelve ears come out , which were perfect green barley , of the same kind as our european — nay , as our english barley .",67
"_ april _ 16.—i finished the ladder ; so i went up the ladder to the top , and then pulled it up after me , and let it down in the inside . this was a complete enclosure to me ; for within i had room enough , and nothing could come at me from without , unless it could first mount my wall .",45
"after the third shock was over , and i felt no more for some time , i began to take courage ; and yet i had not heart enough to go over my wall again , for fear of being buried alive , but sat still upon the ground greatly cast down and disconsolate , not knowing what to do . all this while i had not the least serious religious thought ; nothing but the common “ lord have mercy upon me ! ” and when it was over that went away too .",25

"she was pale and fair , with long curls falling in profusion over her shoulders , had large , blue , languishing eyes , rosy lips , and hands of alabaster .",16

"scarcely had he gone ten steps when his ears began to tingle , a faintness seized him , a cloud of blood passed over his eyes , and he fell in the middle of the street , crying still , "" coward ! coward ! coward ! """,1
""" he is a coward , indeed , "" grumbled the host , drawing near to d’artagnan , and endeavoring by this little flattery to make up matters with the young man , as the heron of the fable did with the snail he had despised the evening before .",44

"unfortunately , there was one circumstance which created a powerful obstacle to the accomplishment of this threat ; which was , as we have related , that his sword had been in his first conflict broken in two , and which he had entirely forgotten .",23

""",35
"m de troisville , as his family was still called in gascony , or m. de treville , as he has ended by styling himself in paris , had really commenced life as d’artagnan now did ; that is to say , without a sou in his pocket , but with a fund of audacity , shrewdness , and intelligence which makes the poorest gascon gentleman often derive more in his hope from the paternal inheritance than the richest perigordian or berrichan gentleman derives in reality from his .",20
"his insolent bravery , his still more insolent success at a time when blows poured down like hail , had borne him to the top of that difficult ladder called court favor , which he had climbed four steps at a time .",19
"thanks to this double gift and the spotless name that accompanied it , m. de treville was admitted into the household of the young prince where he made such good use of his sword , and was so faithful to his motto , that louis xiii , one of the good blades of his kingdom , was accustomed to say that if he had a friend who was about to fight , he would advise him to choose as a second , himself first , and treville next -- or even , perhaps , before himself .",63
"thus louis xiii had a real liking for treville -- a royal liking , a self - interested liking , it is true , but still a liking .",3
"at last louis xiii made treville the captain of his musketeers , who were to louis xiii in devotedness , or rather in fanaticism , what his ordinaries had been to henry iii , and his scotch guard to louis xi .",28
"when he saw the formidable and chosen body with which louis xiii had surrounded himself , this second , or rather this first king of france , became desirous that he , too , should have his guard .",12

"for the rest , in the memoirs of this period , which has left so many memoirs , one does not find this worthy gentleman blamed even by his enemies ; and he had many such among men of the pen as well as among men of the sword . in no instance , let us say , was this worthy gentleman accused of deriving personal advantage from the cooperation of his minions .",33
"still further , in spite of sword thrusts which weaken , and painful exercises which fatigue , he had become one of the most gallant frequenters of revels , one of the most insinuating lady ’s men , one of the softest whisperers of interesting nothings of his day ; the bonnes fortunes of de treville were talked of as those of m. de bassompierre had been talked of twenty years before , and that was not saying a little .",65
"in this apartment a continued buzzing prevailed from morning till night , while m. de treville , in his office contiguous to this antechamber , received visits , listened to complaints , gave his orders , and like the king in his balcony at the louvre , had only to place himself at the window to review both his men and arms .",47
"the day on which d’artagnan presented himself the assemblage was imposing , particularly for a provincial just arriving from his province . it is true that this provincial was a gascon ; and that , particularly at this period , the compatriots of d’artagnan had the reputation of not being easily intimidated .",44
"when he had once passed the massive door covered with long square - headed nails , he fell into the midst of a troop of swordsmen , who crossed one another in their passage , calling out , quarreling , and playing tricks one with another .",2
"when he had passed one group he began to breathe more freely ; but he could not help observing that they turned round to look at him , and for the first time in his life d’artagnan , who had till that day entertained a very good opinion of himself , felt ridiculous .",2

"a circle was formed around them . the conditions required that at every hit the man touched should quit the game , yielding his turn for the benefit of the adversary who had hit him .",32
"he believed himself transported into that famous country of giants into which gulliver afterward went and was so frightened ; and yet he had not gained the goal , for there were still the landing place and the antechamber .",23
"his warm and fickle imagination , which in gascony had rendered formidable to young chambermaids , and even sometimes their mistresses , had never dreamed , even in moments of delirium , of half the amorous wonders or a quarter of the feats of gallantry which were here set forth in connection with names the best known and with details the least concealed .",9
"we have no need , therefore , to say that d’artagnan dared not join in the conversation , only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his ears , stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing ; and despite his confidence on the paternal admonitions , he felt himself carried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to blame the unheard - of things which were taking place .",1

""" what would you have ? "" said the musketeer . "" this fashion is coming in . it is a folly , i admit , but still it is the fashion .",4
"this other musketeer formed a perfect contrast to his interrogator , who had just designated him by the name of aramis . he was a stout man , of about two- or three - and - twenty , with an open , ingenuous countenance , a black , mild eye , and cheeks rosy and downy as an autumn peach . his delicate mustache marked a perfectly straight line upon his upper lip ; he appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their veins should swell , and he pinched the tips of his ears from time to time to preserve their delicate pink transparency .",12

"as perhaps our readers are not familiar with the slang of the rue de jerusalem , and as it is fifteen years since we applied this word for the first time to this thing , allow us to explain to them what is a mousetrap . when in a house , of whatever kind it may be , an individual suspected of any crime is arrested , the arrest is held secret . four or five men are placed in ambuscade in the first room . the door is opened to all who knock . it is closed after them , and they are arrested ; so that at the end of two or three days they have in their power almost all the habitues of the establishment .",117

"all at once he started . his eyes became fixed upon a point of the sea , commanded by the terrace where he was . with the eagle glance of a sailor he had recognized there , where another would have seen only a gull hovering over the waves , the sail of a sloop which was directed toward the cost of france .",40
""" god has so willed it ! "" said he , with the resignation of a fanatic ; but without , however , being able to take his eyes from that ship , on board of which he doubtless fancied he could distinguish the white outline of her to whom he had sacrificed his life .",51

"the first fear of the king of england , charles i , on learning of the death of the duke , was that such terrible news might discourage the rochellais ; he tried , says richelieu in his memoirs , to conceal it from them as long as possible , closing all the ports of his kingdom , and carefully keeping watch that no vessel should sail until the army which buckingham was getting together had gone , taking upon himself , in default of buckingham , to superintend the departure .",75
"but as he did not think of giving this order till five hours after the event -- that is to say , till two o’clock in the afternoon -- two vessels had already left the port , the one bearing , as we know , milady , who , already anticipating the event , was further confirmed in that belief by seeing the black flag flying at the masthead of the admiral ’s ship .",31
"m de treville , being informed of this by his eminence , packed his portmanteau ; and as without knowing the cause he knew the great desire and even imperative need which his friends had of returning to paris , it goes without saying that he fixed upon them to form part of the escort .",34
it was then that d’artagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred upon him in making him at last enter the musketeers -- for without that circumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his companions left it .,29
"it goes without saying that this impatience to return toward paris had for a cause the danger which mme . bonacieux would run of meeting at the convent of bethune with milady , her mortal enemy .",11
"aramis therefore had written immediately to marie michon , the seamstress at tours who had such fine acquaintances , to obtain from the queen authority for mme . bonacieux to leave the convent , and to retire either into lorraine or belgium .",14
"it may be easily imagined how the relationship between aramis and a seamstress who called the queen her sister amused the young men ; but aramis , after having blushed two or three times up to the whites of his eyes at the gross pleasantry of porthos , begged his friends not to revert to the subject again , declaring that if a single word more was said to him about it , he would never again implore his cousins to interfere in such affairs .",28
"there was no further question , therefore , about marie michon among the four musketeers , who besides had what they wanted : that was , the order to withdraw mme . bonacieux from the convent of the carmelites of bethune .",18
"the king , however , who sought distraction , while traveling as fast as possible -- for he was anxious to be in paris by the twenty - third -- stopped from time to time to fly the magpie , a pastime for which the taste had been formerly inspired in him by de luynes , and for which he had always preserved a great predilection .",46

"all the past was effaced from the eyes of this woman ; and her looks , fixed on the future , beheld nothing but the high fortunes reserved for her by the cardinal , whom she had so successfully served without his name being in any way mixed up with the sanguinary affair .",36

"there was connected with the remembrance of this girl a remembrance of anger ; and a desire of vengeance disordered the features of milady , which , however , immediately recovered the calm and benevolent expression which this woman of a hundred faces had for a moment allowed them to lose .",43
"but you have been traveling these four days , as you told me yourself . this morning you rose at five o’clock ; you must stand in need of repose .",2
"although milady would very willingly have gone without sleep , sustained as she was by all the excitements which a new adventure awakened in her heart , ever thirsting for intrigues , she nevertheless accepted the offer of the superior . during the last fifteen days she had experienced so many and such various emotions that if her frame of iron was still capable of supporting fatigue , her mind required repose .",5
she remembered that almost unlimited promise which the cardinal had given her if she succeeded in her enterprise .,9
"but alas , if he was the friend of d’artagnan , he must have lent him his assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated the project of his eminence ; if he was the friend of d’artagnan , he was the enemy of the cardinal ; and she doubtless would succeed in involving him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young musketeer .",13

"the relevant data on this apparition , as recorded in various logbooks , agreed pretty closely as to the structure of the object or creature in question , its unprecedented speed of movement , its startling locomotive power , and the unique vitality with which it seemed to be gifted . if it was a cetacean , it exceeded in bulk any whale previously classified by science . no naturalist , neither cuvier nor lacépède , neither professor dumeril nor professor de quatrefages , would have accepted the existence of such a monster sight unseen-- specifically , unseen by their own scientific eyes .",85

"in every big city the monster was the latest rage ; they sang about it in the coffee houses , they ridiculed it in the newspapers , they dramatized it in the theaters . the tabloids found it a fine opportunity for hatching all sorts of hoaxes . in those newspapers short of copy , you saw the reappearance of every gigantic imaginary creature , from "" moby dick , "" that dreadful white whale from the high arctic regions , to the stupendous kraken whose tentacles could entwine a 500-ton craft and drag it into the ocean depths . they even reprinted reports from ancient times : the views of aristotle and pliny accepting the existence of such monsters , then the norwegian stories of bishop pontoppidan , the narratives of paul egede , and finally the reports of captain harrington-- whose good faith is above suspicion -- in which he claims he saw , while aboard the castilian in 1857 , one of those enormous serpents that , until then , had frequented only the seas of france 's old extremist newspaper , the constitutionalist .",173

"on november 26 , at three o'clock in the morning , the nautilus cleared the tropic of cancer at longitude 172 degrees . on the 27th it passed in sight of the hawaiian islands , where the famous captain cook met his death on february 14 , 1779 . by then we had fared 4,860 leagues from our starting point . when i arrived on the platform that morning , i saw the island of hawaii two miles to leeward , the largest of the seven islands making up this group . i could clearly distinguish the tilled soil on its outskirts , the various mountain chains running parallel with its coastline , and its volcanoes , crowned by mauna kea , whose elevation is 5,000 meters above sea level . among other specimens from these waterways , our nets brought up some peacock - tailed flabellarian coral , polyps flattened into stylish shapes and unique to this part of the ocean .",52
"it was during the night of december 9 - 10 that the nautilus encountered this army of distinctly nocturnal mollusks . they numbered in the millions . they were migrating from the temperate zones toward zones still warmer , following the itineraries of herring and sardines . we stared at them through our thick glass windows : they swam backward with tremendous speed , moving by means of their locomotive tubes , chasing fish and mollusks , eating the little ones , eaten by the big ones , and tossing in indescribable confusion the ten feet that nature has rooted in their heads like a hairpiece of pneumatic snakes . despite its speed , the nautilus navigated for several hours in the midst of this school of animals , and its nets brought up an incalculable number , among which i recognized all nine species that professor orbigny has classified as native to the pacific ocean .",98

"what a scene ! we stood dumbstruck , hearts pounding , before this shipwreck caught in the act , as if it had been photographed in its final moments , so to speak ! and already i could see enormous sharks moving in , eyes ablaze , drawn by the lure of human flesh !",22
"sailors ' luck led the nautilus straight to reao island , one of the most unusual in this group , which was discovered in 1822 by captain bell aboard the minerva . so i was able to study the madreporic process that has created the islands in this ocean .",42
"madrepores , which one must guard against confusing with precious coral , clothe their tissue in a limestone crust , and their variations in structure have led my famous mentor professor milne - edwards to classify them into five divisions . the tiny microscopic animals that secrete this polypary live by the billions in the depths of their cells . their limestone deposits build up into rocks , reefs , islets , islands . in some places , they form atolls , a circular ring surrounding a lagoon or small inner lake that gaps place in contact with the sea . elsewhere , they take the shape of barrier reefs , such as those that exist along the coasts of new caledonia and several of the tuamotu islands . in still other localities , such as réunion island and the island of mauritius , they build fringing reefs , high , straight walls next to which the ocean 's depth is considerable .",25
"when the nautilus returned to the surface of the ocean , i could take in reao island over its whole flat , wooded expanse . obviously its madreporic rocks had been made fertile by tornadoes and thunderstorms . one day , carried off by a hurricane from neighboring shores , some seed fell onto these limestone beds , mixing with decomposed particles of fish and marine plants to form vegetable humus . propelled by the waves , a coconut arrived on this new coast . its germ took root . its tree grew tall , catching steam off the water . a brook was born . little by little , vegetation spread . tiny animals -- worms , insects -- rode ashore on tree trunks snatched from islands to windward . turtles came to lay their eggs . birds nested in the young trees . in this way animal life developed , and drawn by the greenery and fertile soil , man appeared . and that 's how these islands were formed , the immense achievement of microscopic animals .",29
"by december 15 we had left the alluring society islands in the west , likewise elegant tahiti , queen of the pacific . in the morning i spotted this island 's lofty summits a few miles to leeward . its waters supplied excellent fish for the tables on board : mackerel , bonito , albacore , and a few varieties of that sea serpent named the moray eel .",4
"i had n't seen captain nemo for over a week , when , on the morning of the 27th , he entered the main lounge , as usual acting as if he 'd been gone for just five minutes . i was busy tracing the nautilus 's course on the world map . the captain approached , placed a finger over a position on the chart , and pronounced just one word :",1
this name was magic ! it was the name of those islets where vessels under the count de la pérouse had miscarried . i straightened suddenly .,20
""" we already have , professor . """,3
"in the northeast there emerged two volcanic islands of unequal size , surrounded by a coral reef whose circuit measured forty miles . we were facing the island of vanikoro proper , to which captain dumont d'urville had given the name "" island of the search "" ; we lay right in front of the little harbor of vana , located in latitude 16 degrees 4 ' south and longitude 164 degrees 32 ' east . its shores seemed covered with greenery from its beaches to its summits inland , crowned by mt . kapogo , which is 476 fathoms high .",37
"after clearing the outer belt of rocks via a narrow passageway , the nautilus lay inside the breakers where the sea had a depth of thirty to forty fathoms . under the green shade of some tropical evergreens , i spotted a few savages who looked extremely startled at our approach . in this long , blackish object advancing flush with the water , did n't they see some fearsome cetacean that they were obliged to view with distrust ?",21
"but just then the renowned french explorer captain dumont d'urville , unaware of dillon 's activities , had already set sail to search elsewhere for the site of the shipwreck . in essence , a whaling vessel had reported that some medals and a cross of st . louis had been found in the hands of savages in the louisiade islands and new caledonia .",37

"so captain dumont d'urville had put to sea in command of a vessel named after the astrolabe , and just two months after dillon had left vanikoro , dumont d'urville dropped anchor before hobart . there he heard about dillon 's findings , and he further learned that a certain james hobbs , chief officer on the union out of calcutta , had put to shore on an island located in latitude 8 degrees 18 ' south and longitude 156 degrees 30 ' east , and had noted the natives of those waterways making use of iron bars and red fabrics .",24

"pretty perplexed , dumont d'urville did n't know if he should give credence to these reports , which had been carried in some of the less reliable newspapers ; nevertheless , he decided to start on dillon 's trail .",18
"on february 10 , 1828 , the new astrolabe hove before tikopia island , took on a guide and interpreter in the person of a deserter who had settled there , plied a course toward vanikoro , raised it on february 12 , sailed along its reefs until the 14th , and only on the 20th dropped anchor inside its barrier in the harbor of vana .",27
"on the 23rd , several officers circled the island and brought back some rubble of little importance . the natives , adopting a system of denial and evasion , refused to guide them to the site of the casualty . this rather shady conduct aroused the suspicion that the natives had mistreated the castaways ; and in truth , the natives seemed afraid that dumont d'urville had come to avenge the count de la pérouse and his unfortunate companions .",66
"questioning the natives , captain dumont d'urville also learned that after la pérouse 's two ships had miscarried on the island 's reefs , the count had built a smaller craft , only to go off and miscarry a second time . where ? nobody knew .",16
"the commander of the new astrolabe then had a monument erected under a tuft of mangrove , in memory of the famous navigator and his companions . it was a simple quadrangular pyramid , set on a coral base , with no ironwork to tempt the natives ' avarice .",7
"meanwhile , fearing that dumont d'urville was n't abreast of dillon 's activities , the french government sent a sloop of war to vanikoro , the bayonnaise under commander legoarant de tromelin , who had been stationed on the american west coast . dropping anchor before vanikoro a few months after the new astrolabe 's departure , the bayonnaise did n't find any additional evidence but verified that the savages had n't disturbed the memorial honoring the count de la pérouse .",34
"i rushed to the window and saw crusts of coral : fungus coral , siphonula coral , alcyon coral , sea anemone from the genus caryophylia , plus myriads of charming fish including greenfish , damselfish , sweepers , snappers , and squirrelfish ; underneath this coral covering i detected some rubble the old dredges had n't been able to tear free-- iron stirrups , anchors , cannons , shells , tackle from a capstan , a stempost , all objects hailing from the wrecked ships and now carpeted in moving flowers .",55
"during the night of december 27 - 28 , the nautilus left the waterways of vanikoro behind with extraordinary speed . its heading was southwesterly , and in three days it had cleared the 750 leagues that separated la pérouse 's islands from the southeastern tip of papua .",31

"the next day , january 6 : nothing new on board . not a sound inside , not a sign of life . the skiff stayed alongside in the same place we had left it . we decided to return to gueboroa island . ned land hoped for better luck in his hunting than on the day before , and he wanted to visit a different part of the forest .",32
"after crossing through a moderately dense thicket , we again found some plains obstructed by bushes . there i saw some magnificent birds soaring aloft , the arrangement of their long feathers causing them to head into the wind . their undulating flight , the grace of their aerial curves , and the play of their colors allured and delighted the eye . i had no trouble identifying them .",64
"malaysians , who do a booming business in these birds with the chinese , have various methods for catching them that we could n't use . sometimes they set snares on the tops of the tall trees that the bird of paradise prefers to inhabit . at other times they capture it with a tenacious glue that paralyzes its movements . they will even go so far as to poison the springs where these fowl habitually drink . but in our case , all we could do was fire at them on the wing , which left us little chance of getting one . and in truth , we used up a good part of our ammunition in vain .",14

"this bird belonged to the finest of the eight species credited to papua and its neighboring islands . it was a "" great emerald , "" one of the rarest birds of paradise . it measured three decimeters long . its head was comparatively small , and its eyes , placed near the opening of its beak , were also small . but it offered a wonderful mixture of hues : a yellow beak , brown feet and claws , hazel wings with purple tips , pale yellow head and scruff of the neck , emerald throat , the belly and chest maroon to brown . two strands , made of a horn substance covered with down , rose over its tail , which was lengthened by long , very light feathers of wonderful fineness , and they completed the costume of this marvelous bird that the islanders have poetically named "" the sun bird .

"so the skiff did n't leave shipside that day , much to the displeasure of mr . land who could n't complete his provisions . the adroit canadian spent his time preparing the meat and flour products he had brought from gueboroa island . as for the savages , they went back to shore near eleven o'clock in the morning , when the heads of coral began to disappear under the waves of the rising tide . but i saw their numbers swell considerably on the beach . it was likely that they had come from neighboring islands or from the mainland of papua proper . however , i did n't see one local dugout canoe .",93
"having nothing better to do , i decided to dredge these beautiful , clear waters , which exhibited a profusion of shells , zoophytes , and open - sea plants . besides , it was the last day the nautilus would spend in these waterways , if , tomorrow , it still floated off to the open sea as captain nemo had promised .",61
"for two hours our fishing proceeded energetically but without bringing up any rarities . our dragnet was filled with midas abalone , harp shells , obelisk snails , and especially the finest hammer shells i had seen to that day . we also gathered in a few sea cucumbers , some pearl oysters , and a dozen small turtles that we saved for the ship 's pantry .",35

"and so , by loading up its ballast tanks , or by sinking obliquely with its slanting fins , the nautilus successively reached depths of 3,000 , 4,000 , 5,000 , 7,000 , 9,000 , and 10,000 meters , and the ultimate conclusion from these experiments was that , in all latitudes , the sea had a permanent temperature of 4.5 degrees centigrade at a depth of 1,000 meters .",55

"just then the chief officer drew the captain 's attention anew . the latter interrupted his strolling and aimed his spyglass at the point indicated . he observed it a good while . as for me , deeply puzzled , i went below to the lounge and brought back an excellent long - range telescope i habitually used . leaning my elbows on the beacon housing , which jutted from the stern of the platform , i got set to scour that whole stretch of sky and sea . but no sooner had i peered into the eyepiece than the instrument was snatched from my hands .",92

""",29
"we were silent . what was captain nemo thinking ? perhaps that this approaching shore was too close for comfort , contrary to the canadian 's views in which it still seemed too far away . as for conseil , he had come along out of simple curiosity .",41
"near 5:30 the first glimmers of light on the horizon defined the upper lines of the coast with greater distinctness . fairly flat to the east , it swelled a little toward the south . five miles still separated it from us , and its beach merged with the misty waters . between us and the shore , the sea was deserted . not a boat , not a diver . profound solitude reigned over this gathering place of pearl fishermen . as captain nemo had commented , we were arriving in these waterways a month too soon .",85
"as captain nemo pronounced these words , i turned to conseil and ned land . but my two friends had already encased their craniums in their metal headgear , and they could neither hear nor reply .",19
i had one question left to address to captain nemo .,1
"the sun was already sending sufficient light under these waves . the tiniest objects remained visible . after ten minutes of walking , we were in five meters of water , and the terrain had become almost flat .",34
"like a covey of snipe over a marsh , there rose underfoot schools of unusual fish from the genus monopterus , whose members have no fin but their tail . i recognized the javanese eel , a genuine eight - decimeter serpent with a bluish gray belly , which , without the gold lines over its flanks , could easily be confused with the conger eel . from the butterfish genus , whose oval bodies are very flat , i observed several adorned in brilliant colors and sporting a dorsal fin like a sickle , edible fish that , when dried and marinated , make an excellent dish known by the name "" karawade "" ; then some sea poachers , fish belonging to the genus aspidophoroides , whose bodies are covered with scaly armor divided into eight lengthwise sections .",23
"the shellfish meleagrina , that womb for pearls whose valves are nearly equal in size , has the shape of a round shell with thick walls and a very rough exterior . some of these shells were furrowed with flaky , greenish bands that radiated down from the top . these were the young oysters . the others had rugged black surfaces , measured up to fifteen centimeters in width , and were ten or more years old .",16

"but we could n't stop . we had to follow the captain , who headed down trails seemingly known only to himself . the seafloor rose noticeably , and when i lifted my arms , sometimes they would pass above the surface of the sea . then the level of the oysterbank would lower unpredictably . often we went around tall , pointed rocks rising like pyramids . in their dark crevices huge crustaceans , aiming their long legs like heavy artillery , watched us with unblinking eyes , while underfoot there crept millipedes , bloodworms , aricia worms , and annelid worms , whose antennas and tubular tentacles were incredibly long .",7
"captain nemo went in . we followed him . my eyes soon grew accustomed to this comparative gloom . i distinguished the unpredictably contoured springings of a vault , supported by natural pillars firmly based on a granite foundation , like the weighty columns of tuscan architecture . why had our incomprehensible guide taken us into the depths of this underwater crypt ? i would soon find out .",49
"after going down a fairly steep slope , our feet trod the floor of a sort of circular pit . there captain nemo stopped , and his hand indicated an object that i had n't yet noticed . it was an oyster of extraordinary dimensions , a titanic giant clam , a holy - water font that could have held a whole lake , a basin more than two meters wide , hence even bigger than the one adorning the nautilus 's lounge .",33

"captain nemo was obviously familiar with this bivalve 's existence . this was n't the first time he 'd paid it a visit , and i thought his sole reason for leading us to this locality was to show us a natural curiosity . i was mistaken . captain nemo had an explicit personal interest in checking on the current condition of this giant clam .",50
"five meters away a shadow appeared and dropped to the seafloor . the alarming idea of sharks crossed my mind . but i was mistaken , and once again we did n't have to deal with monsters of the deep .",32
"this diver did n't see us . a shadow cast by our crag hid us from his view . and besides , how could this poor indian ever have guessed that human beings , creatures like himself , were near him under the waters , eavesdropping on his movements , not missing a single detail of his fishing !",28
"i observed him with great care . his movements were systematically executed , and for half an hour no danger seemed to threaten him . so i had gotten used to the sight of this fascinating fishing when all at once , just as the indian was kneeling on the seafloor , i saw him make a frightened gesture , stand , and gather himself to spring back to the surface of the waves . i understood his fear . a gigantic shadow appeared above the poor diver . it was a shark of huge size , moving in diagonally , eyes ablaze , jaws wide open !",27
"the waves were saturated with masses of blood . the waters shook with the movements of the man - eater , which thrashed about with indescribable fury . ned land had n't missed his target . this was the monster 's death rattle . pierced to the heart , it was struggling with dreadful spasms whose aftershocks knocked conseil off his feet .",30
"captain nemo 's first concern was to revive this unfortunate man . i was n't sure he would succeed . i hoped so , since the poor devil had n't been under very long . but that stroke from the shark 's tail could have been his deathblow .",44
"fortunately , after vigorous massaging by conseil and the captain , i saw the nearly drowned man regain consciousness little by little . he opened his eyes . how startled he must have felt , how frightened even , at seeing four huge , copper craniums leaning over him !",32
"and above all , what must he have thought when captain nemo pulled a bag of pearls from a pocket in his diving suit and placed it in the fisherman 's hands ? this magnificent benefaction from the man of the waters to the poor indian from ceylon was accepted by the latter with trembling hands . his bewildered eyes indicated that he did n't know to what superhuman creatures he owed both his life and his fortune .",7

our path was getting brighter and brighter . the red glow had turned white and was radiating from a mountain peak about 800 feet high . but what i saw was simply a reflection produced by the crystal waters of these strata . the furnace that was the source of this inexplicable light occupied the far side of the mountain .,11
"it was one o'clock in the morning . we arrived at the mountain 's lower gradients . but in grappling with them , we had to venture up difficult trails through a huge thicket .",24
"two hours after leaving the nautilus , we had cleared the timberline , and 100 feet above our heads stood the mountain peak , forming a dark silhouette against the brilliant glare that came from its far slope . petrified shrubs rambled here and there in sprawling zigzags . fish rose in a body at our feet like birds startled in tall grass . the rocky mass was gouged with impenetrable crevices , deep caves , unfathomable holes at whose far ends i could hear fearsome things moving around . my blood would curdle as i watched some enormous antenna bar my path , or saw some frightful pincer snap shut in the shadow of some cavity ! a thousand specks of light glittered in the midst of the gloom . they were the eyes of gigantic crustaceans crouching in their lairs , giant lobsters rearing up like spear carriers and moving their claws with a scrap - iron clanking , titanic crabs aiming their bodies like cannons on their carriages , and hideous devilfish intertwining their tentacles like bushes of writhing snakes .",8
"what was this astounding world that i did n't yet know ? in what order did these articulates belong , these creatures for which the rocks provided a second carapace ? where had nature learned the secret of their vegetating existence , and for how many centuries had they lived in the ocean 's lower strata ?",32

"i followed him with one last burst of energy , and in a few minutes i had scaled the peak , which crowned the whole rocky mass by some ten meters .",16
"i looked back down the side we had just cleared . there the mountain rose only 700 to 800 feet above the plains ; but on its far slope it crowned the receding bottom of this part of the atlantic by a height twice that . my eyes scanned the distance and took in a vast area lit by intense flashes of light . in essence , this mountain was a volcano . fifty feet below its peak , amid a shower of stones and slag , a wide crater vomited torrents of lava that were dispersed in fiery cascades into the heart of the liquid mass . so situated , this volcano was an immense torch that lit up the lower plains all the way to the horizon .",7
"in fact , there beneath my eyes was a town in ruins , demolished , overwhelmed , laid low , its roofs caved in , its temples pulled down , its arches dislocated , its columns stretching over the earth ; in these ruins you could still detect the solid proportions of a sort of tuscan architecture ; farther off , the remains of a gigantic aqueduct ; here , the caked heights of an acropolis along with the fluid forms of a parthenon ; there , the remnants of a wharf , as if some bygone port had long ago harbored merchant vessels and triple - tiered war galleys on the shores of some lost ocean ; still farther off , long rows of collapsing walls , deserted thoroughfares , a whole pompeii buried under the waters , which captain nemo had resurrected before my eyes !",98

"one day solon was conversing with some elderly wise men in the egyptian capital of sais , a town already 8,000 years of age , as documented by the annals engraved on the sacred walls of its temples . one of these elders related the history of another town 1,000 years older still . this original city of athens , ninety centuries old , had been invaded and partly destroyed by the atlanteans . these atlanteans , he said , resided on an immense continent greater than africa and asia combined , taking in an area that lay between latitude 12 degrees and 40 degrees north . their dominion extended even to egypt . they tried to enforce their rule as far as greece , but they had to retreat before the indomitable resistance of the hellenic people . centuries passed . a cataclysm occurred -- floods , earthquakes . a single night and day were enough to obliterate this atlantis , whose highest peaks ( madeira , the azores , the canaries , the cape verde islands ) still emerge above the waves .",127
"these were the historical memories that captain nemo 's scrawl sent rushing through my mind . thus , led by the strangest of fates , i was treading underfoot one of the mountains of that continent ! my hands were touching ruins many thousands of years old , contemporary with prehistoric times ! i was walking in the very place where contemporaries of early man had walked ! my heavy soles were crushing the skeletons of animals from the age of fable , animals that used to take cover in the shade of these trees now turned to stone !",65

"as i mused in this way , trying to establish in my memory every detail of this impressive landscape , captain nemo was leaning his elbows on a moss - covered monument , motionless as if petrified in some mute trance . was he dreaming of those lost generations , asking them for the secret of human destiny ? was it here that this strange man came to revive himself , basking in historical memories , reliving that bygone life , he who had no desire for our modern one ? i would have given anything to know his thoughts , to share them , understand them !",83

"in essence , numerous fish had caught his eye , and when fish pass by , conseil vanishes into his world of classifying and leaves real life behind . in which case i could only tag along and resume our ichthyological research .",5
"nightfall did n't interrupt my observations . i was left to myself . conseil had repaired to his cabin . the nautilus slowed down , hovering above the muddled masses on the seafloor , sometimes grazing them as if wanting to come to rest , sometimes rising unpredictably to the surface of the waves . then i glimpsed a few bright constellations through the crystal waters , specifically five or six of those zodiacal stars trailing from the tail end of orion .",14
"i climbed as far as the hatch . it was open . but instead of the broad daylight i was expecting , i found that i was surrounded by total darkness . where were we ? had i been mistaken ? was it still night ? no ! not one star was twinkling , and nighttime is never so utterly black .",36
"this stream of electricity dazzled my eyes , and after momentarily shutting them , i looked around . the nautilus was stationary . it was floating next to an embankment shaped like a wharf . as for the water now buoying the ship , it was a lake completely encircled by an inner wall about two miles in diameter , hence six miles around . its level -- as indicated by the pressure gauge -- would be the same as the outside level , because some connection had to exist between this lake and the sea . slanting inward over their base , these high walls converged to form a vault shaped like an immense upside - down funnel that measured 500 or 600 meters in height . at its summit there gaped the circular opening through which i had detected that faint glimmer , obviously daylight .",87

"i thanked the captain and went to look for my two companions , who had n't yet left their cabin . i invited them to follow me , not telling them where we were . they climbed onto the platform . conseil , whom nothing could startle , saw it as a perfectly natural thing to fall asleep under the waves and wake up under a mountain . but ned land had no idea in his head other than to see if this cavern offered some way out .",71
"the ground rose appreciably as it moved away from the sand flats by the waves , and we soon arrived at some long , winding gradients , genuinely steep paths that allowed us to climb little by little ; but we had to tread cautiously in the midst of pudding stones that were n't cemented together , and our feet kept skidding on glassy trachyte , made of feldspar and quartz crystals .",41
""" can you picture , "" i asked them , "" what this funnel must have been like when it was filled with boiling lava , and the level of that incandescent liquid rose right to the mountain 's mouth , like cast iron up the insides of a furnace ? """,15
""" and i might add , mr . land , "" i said , "" that the waters would n't have rushed under the mountain , and the volcano would still be a volcano . so you have nothing to be sorry about . """,20
""" and i might add , mr . land , "" i said , "" that the waters would n't have rushed under the mountain , and the volcano would still be a volcano . so you have nothing to be sorry about . """,37
"at an elevation of about thirty meters , the nature of the terrain changed without becoming any easier . pudding stones and trachyte gave way to black basaltic rock : here , lying in slabs all swollen with blisters ; there , shaped like actual prisms and arranged into a series of columns that supported the springings of this immense vault , a wonderful sample of natural architecture . then , among this basaltic rock , there snaked long , hardened lava flows inlaid with veins of bituminous coal and in places covered by wide carpets of sulfur . the sunshine coming through the crater had grown stronger , shedding a hazy light over all the volcanic waste forever buried in the heart of this extinct mountain .",105
"but when we had ascended to an elevation of about 250 feet , we were stopped by insurmountable obstacles . the converging inside walls changed into overhangs , and our climb into a circular stroll . at this topmost level the vegetable kingdom began to challenge the mineral kingdom . shrubs , and even a few trees , emerged from crevices in the walls . i recognized some spurges that let their caustic , purgative sap trickle out . there were heliotropes , very remiss at living up to their sun - worshipping reputations since no sunlight ever reached them ; their clusters of flowers drooped sadly , their colors and scents were faded . here and there chrysanthemums sprouted timidly at the feet of aloes with long , sad , sickly leaves . but between these lava flows i spotted little violets that still gave off a subtle fragrance , and i confess that i inhaled it with delight . the soul of a flower is its scent , and those splendid water plants , flowers of the sea , have no souls !",3

"naturally enough , the canadian wanted to lay in a supply of honey , and it would have been ill - mannered of me to say no . he mixed sulfur with some dry leaves , set them on fire with a spark from his tinderbox , and proceeded to smoke the bees out . little by little the buzzing died down and the disemboweled hive yielded several pounds of sweet honey . ned land stuffed his haversack with it .",17
""" when i 've mixed this honey with our breadfruit batter , "" he told us , "" i 'll be ready to serve you a delectable piece of cake . """,3
"by then we were forced to go back down to the beach because the ridge had become impossible . above us , the yawning crater looked like the wide mouth of a well . from where we stood , the sky was pretty easy to see , and i watched clouds race by , disheveled by the west wind , letting tatters of mist trail over the mountain 's summit . proof positive that those clouds kept at a moderate altitude , because this volcano did n't rise more than 1,800 feet above the level of the ocean .",15
"we were stretched out in this delightful cave for an hour . our conversation , lively at the outset , then languished . a definite drowsiness overcame us . since i saw no good reason to resist the call of sleep , i fell into a heavy doze . i dreamed -- one does n't choose his dreams -- that my life had been reduced to the vegetating existence of a simple mollusk . it seemed to me that this cave made up my double - valved shell . . . .",62

"three - quarters of an hour later , we had completed our circular stroll and were back on board . just then the crewmen finished loading the sodium supplies , and the nautilus could have departed immediately . but captain nemo gave no orders . would he wait for nightfall and exit through his underwater passageway in secrecy ? perhaps . be that as it may , by the next day the nautilus had left its home port and was navigating well out from any shore , a few meters beneath the waves of the atlantic .",9

"properly speaking , the sargasso sea covers every submerged part of atlantis . certain authors have even held that the many weeds strewn over this sea were torn loose from the prairies of that ancient continent . but it 's more likely that these grasses , algae , and fucus plants were carried off from the beaches of europe and america , then taken as far as this zone by the gulf stream . this is one of the reasons why christopher columbus assumed the existence of a new world . when the ships of that bold investigator arrived in the sargasso sea , they had great difficulty navigating in the midst of these weeds , which , much to their crews ' dismay , slowed them down to a halt ; and they wasted three long weeks crossing this sector .",105
"i share maury 's view , and i was able to study the phenomenon in this exclusive setting where ships rarely go . above us , huddled among the brown weeds , there floated objects originating from all over : tree trunks ripped from the rocky mountains or the andes and sent floating down the amazon or the mississippi , numerous pieces of wreckage , remnants of keels or undersides , bulwarks staved in and so weighed down with seashells and barnacles , they could n't rise to the surface of the ocean . and the passing years will someday bear out maury 's other view that by collecting in this way over the centuries , these substances will be turned to stone by the action of the waters and will then form inexhaustible coalfields . valuable reserves prepared by farseeing nature for that time when man will have exhausted his mines on the continents .",148
"from this moment on , for nineteen days from february 23 to march 12 , the nautilus stayed in the middle of the atlantic , hustling us along at a constant speed of 100 leagues every twenty - four hours . it was obvious that captain nemo wanted to carry out his underwater program , and i had no doubt that he intended , after doubling cape horn , to return to the pacific south seas .",57
"so ned land had good reason to worry . in these wide seas empty of islands , it was no longer feasible to jump ship . nor did we have any way to counter captain nemo 's whims . we had no choice but to acquiesce ; but if we could n't attain our end through force or cunning , i liked to think we might achieve it through persuasion . once this voyage was over , might not captain nemo consent to set us free in return for our promise never to reveal his existence ? our word of honor , which we sincerely would have kept . however , this delicate question would have to be negotiated with the captain . but how would he receive our demands for freedom ? at the very outset and in no uncertain terms , had n't he declared that the secret of his life required that we be permanently imprisoned on board the nautilus ? would n't he see my four - month silence as a tacit acceptance of this situation ? would my returning to this subject arouse suspicions that could jeopardize our escape plans , if we had promising circumstances for trying again later on ? i weighed all these considerations , turned them over in my mind , submitted them to conseil , but he was as baffled as i was . in short , although i 'm not easily discouraged , i realized that my chances of ever seeing my fellow men again were shrinking by the day , especially at a time when captain nemo was recklessly racing toward the south atlantic !",3

"finally , to conclude , conseil classified a large number of flying fish . nothing could have made a more unusual sight than the marvelous timing with which dolphins hunt these fish . whatever the range of its flight , however evasive its trajectory ( even up and over the nautilus ) , the hapless flying fish always found a dolphin to welcome it with open mouth . these were either flying gurnards or kitelike sea robins , whose lips glowed in the dark , at night scrawling fiery streaks in the air before plunging into the murky waters like so many shooting stars .",16
"by then we had fared nearly 13,000 leagues from our starting point in the pacific high seas . our position fix placed us in latitude 45 degrees 37 ' south and longitude 37 degrees 53 ' west . these were the same waterways where captain denham , aboard the herald , payed out 14,000 meters of sounding line without finding bottom . it was here too that lieutenant parker , aboard the american frigate congress , was unable to reach the underwater soil at 15,149 meters .",3
"it was apparently considered out of the question to dive by filling the ballast tanks . perhaps they would n't sufficiently increase the nautilus 's specific gravity . moreover , in order to come back up , it would be necessary to expel the excess water , and our pumps might not have been strong enough to overcome the outside pressure .",52
"under this powerful thrust the nautilus 's hull quivered like a resonating chord , and the ship sank steadily under the waters . stationed in the lounge , the captain and i watched the needle swerving swiftly over the pressure gauge . soon we had gone below the livable zone where most fish reside . some of these animals can thrive only at the surface of seas or rivers , but a minority can dwell at fairly great depths . among the latter i observed a species of dogfish called the cow shark that 's equipped with six respiratory slits , the telescope fish with its enormous eyes , the armored gurnard with gray thoracic fins plus black pectoral fins and a breastplate protected by pale red slabs of bone , then finally the grenadier , living at a depth of 1,200 meters , by that point tolerating a pressure of 120 atmospheres .",44
""" oho ! we know that , do we ? "" captain nemo replied in a tone of mild surprise . "" well , professor , we have good reason to know it because it 's the truth . i might add , in fact , that the air bladders of fish contain more nitrogen than oxygen when these animals are caught at the surface of the water , and conversely , more oxygen than nitrogen when they 're pulled up from the lower depths . which bears out your formulation . but let 's continue our observations . """,27
"my eyes flew back to the pressure gauge . the instrument indicated a depth of 6,000 meters . our submergence had been going on for an hour . the nautilus slid downward on its slanting fins , still sinking . these deserted waters were wonderfully clear , with a transparency impossible to convey . an hour later we were at 13,000 meters-- about three and a quarter vertical leagues -- and the ocean floor was nowhere in sight .",20
"however , at 14,000 meters i saw blackish peaks rising in the midst of the waters . but these summits could have belonged to mountains as high or even higher than the himalayas or mt . blanc , and the extent of these depths remained incalculable .",21
"despite the powerful pressures it was undergoing , the nautilus sank still deeper . i could feel its sheet - iron plates trembling down to their riveted joins ; metal bars arched ; bulkheads groaned ; the lounge windows seemed to be warping inward under the water 's pressure . and this whole sturdy mechanism would surely have given way , if , as its captain had said , it were n't capable of resisting like a solid block .",57
""" what an experience ! "" i exclaimed .

"before i had time to express the surprise this new proposition caused me , a camera was carried into the lounge at captain nemo 's request . the liquid setting , electrically lit , unfolded with perfect clarity through the wide - open panels . no shadows , no blurs , thanks to our artificial light . not even sunshine could have been better for our purposes . with the thrust of its propeller curbed by the slant of its fins , the nautilus stood still . the camera was aimed at the scenery on the ocean floor , and in a few seconds we had a perfect negative .",61

"before i had time to realize why the captain made this recommendation , i was hurled to the carpet .",2
"its fins set vertically , its propeller thrown in gear at the captain 's signal , the nautilus rose with lightning speed , shooting upward like an air balloon into the sky . vibrating resonantly , it knifed through the watery mass . not a single detail was visible . in four minutes it had cleared the four vertical leagues separating it from the surface of the ocean , and after emerging like a flying fish , it fell back into the sea , making the waves leap to prodigious heights .",54
"for a good while the canadian had said nothing more to me about his escape plans . he had become less sociable , almost sullen . i could see how heavily this protracted imprisonment was weighing on him . i could feel the anger building in him . whenever he encountered the captain , his eyes would flicker with dark fire , and i was in constant dread that his natural vehemence would cause him to do something rash .",6

"the sea was covered with mutilated corpses . a fearsome explosion could n't have slashed , torn , or shredded these fleshy masses with greater violence . we were floating in the midst of gigantic bodies , bluish on the back , whitish on the belly , and all deformed by enormous protuberances . a few frightened sperm whales were fleeing toward the horizon . the waves were dyed red over an area of several miles , and the nautilus was floating in the middle of a sea of blood .",13

"on march 14 at latitude 55 degrees , i spotted floating ice , plain pale bits of rubble twenty to twenty - five feet long , which formed reefs over which the sea burst into foam . the nautilus stayed on the surface of the ocean . having fished in the arctic seas , ned land was already familiar with the sight of icebergs . conseil and i were marveling at them for the first time .",47
"indeed , larger blocks of ice soon appeared , their brilliance varying at the whim of the mists . some of these masses displayed green veins , as if scrawled with undulating lines of copper sulfate . others looked like enormous amethysts , letting the light penetrate their insides . the latter reflected the sun 's rays from the thousand facets of their crystals . the former , tinted with a bright limestone sheen , would have supplied enough building material to make a whole marble town .",76
"the temperature was fairly low . exposed to the outside air , the thermometer marked -2 degrees to -3 degrees centigrade . but we were warmly dressed in furs , for which seals and aquatic bears had paid the price . evenly heated by all its electric equipment , the nautilus 's interior defied the most intense cold . moreover , to find a bearable temperature , the ship had only to sink just a few meters beneath the waves .",36

"two months earlier we would have enjoyed perpetual daylight in this latitude ; but night already fell for three or four hours , and later it would cast six months of shadow over these circumpolar regions .",5
"violent squalls assaulted us during the daytime . thanks to certain heavy mists , we could n't see from one end of the platform to the other . the wind shifted abruptly to every point on the compass . the snow was piling up in such packed layers , it had to be chipped loose with blows from picks . even in a temperature of merely -5 degrees centigrade , every outside part of the nautilus was covered with ice . a ship 's rigging would have been unusable , because all its tackle would have jammed in the grooves of the pulleys . only a craft without sails , driven by an electric motor that needed no coal , could face such high latitudes .",50

"under these conditions the barometer generally stayed quite low . it fell as far as 73.5 centimeters . our compass indications no longer offered any guarantees . the deranged needles would mark contradictory directions as we approached the southern magnetic pole , which does n't coincide with the south pole proper . in fact , according to the astronomer hansteen , this magnetic pole is located fairly close to latitude 70 degrees and longitude 130 degrees , or abiding by the observations of louis - isidore duperrey , in longitude 135 degrees and latitude 70 degrees 30 ' . hence we had to transport compasses to different parts of the ship , take many readings , and strike an average . often we could chart our course only by guesswork , a less than satisfactory method in the midst of these winding passageways whose landmarks change continuously .",101

"it then dawned on me to ask captain nemo if he had already discovered this pole , which no human being had ever trod underfoot .",21
""" no , sir , "" he answered me , "" but we 'll discover it together . where others have failed , i 'll succeed . never before has my nautilus cruised so far into these southernmost seas , but i repeat : it will go farther still . """,29
a sudden insight into captain nemo 's plans had just flashed through my mind . i understood . the marvelous talents of his nautilus would be put to work once again in this superhuman undertaking !,8
""" that 's all ? "" i answered . "" the nautilus has huge air tanks ; we 'll fill them up and they 'll supply all the oxygen we need . """,12

"nevertheless , he did n't waste an instant . at his signal , the chief officer appeared . the two men held a quick exchange in their incomprehensible language , and either the chief officer had been alerted previously or he found the plan feasible , because he showed no surprise .",35
"meanwhile preparations for this daring attempt were getting under way . the nautilus 's powerful pumps forced air down into the tanks and stored it under high pressure . near four o'clock captain nemo informed me that the platform hatches were about to be closed . i took a last look at the dense ice bank we were going to conquer . the weather was fair , the skies reasonably clear , the cold quite brisk , namely -12 degrees centigrade ; but after the wind had lulled , this temperature did n't seem too unbearable .",86
"equipped with picks , some ten men climbed onto the nautilus 's sides and cracked loose the ice around the ship 's lower plating , which was soon set free . this operation was swiftly executed because the fresh ice was still thin . we all reentered the interior . the main ballast tanks were filled with the water that had n't yet congealed at our line of flotation . the nautilus submerged without delay .",60
"about 300 meters down , just as captain nemo had predicted , we cruised beneath the undulating surface of the ice bank . but the nautilus sank deeper still . it reached a depth of 800 meters . at the surface this water gave a temperature of -12 degrees centigrade , but now it gave no more than -10 degrees . two degrees had already been gained . thanks to its heating equipment , the nautilus 's temperature , needless to say , stayed at a much higher degree . every maneuver was accomplished with extraordinary precision .",63
"no . a jolt told me that the nautilus had bumped the underbelly of the ice bank , still quite thick to judge from the hollowness of the accompanying noise . indeed , we had "" struck bottom , "" to use nautical terminology , but in the opposite direction and at a depth of 3,000 feet . that gave us 4,000 feet of ice overhead , of which 1,000 feet emerged above water . so the ice bank was higher here than we had found it on the outskirts . a circumstance less than encouraging .",34

"i rushed up onto the platform . yes , open sea ! barely a few sparse floes , some moving icebergs ; a sea stretching into the distance ; hosts of birds in the air and myriads of fish under the waters , which varied from intense blue to olive green depending on the depth . the thermometer marked 3 degrees centigrade . it was as if a comparative springtime had been locked up behind that ice bank , whose distant masses were outlined on the northern horizon .",70

"so saying , he leaped lightly onto the sand . his heart must have been throbbing with intense excitement . he scaled an overhanging rock that ended in a small promontory and there , mute and motionless , with crossed arms and blazing eyes , he seemed to be laying claim to these southernmost regions . after spending five minutes in this trance , he turned to us .",13

it was eight o'clock in the morning . we had four hours to ourselves before the sun could be productively observed . i guided our steps toward a huge bay that made a crescent - shaped incision in the granite cliffs along the beach .,9
"i drew conseil 's attention to the considerable growth of the cerebral lobes found in these intelligent cetaceans . no mammal except man has more abundant cerebral matter . accordingly , seals are quite capable of being educated ; they make good pets , and together with certain other naturalists , i think these animals can be properly trained to perform yeoman service as hunting dogs for fishermen .",23
"most of these seals were sleeping on the rocks or the sand . among those properly termed seals -- which have no external ears , unlike sea lions whose ears protrude -- i observed several varieties of the species stenorhynchus , three meters long , with white hair , bulldog heads , and armed with ten teeth in each jaw : four incisors in both the upper and lower , plus two big canines shaped like the fleur - de - lis . among them slithered some sea elephants , a type of seal with a short , flexible trunk ; these are the giants of the species , with a circumference of twenty feet and a length of ten meters . they did n't move as we approached .",20
"yet i decided to return to the nautilus . we went along a steep , narrow path that ran over the cliff 's summit . by 11:30 we had arrived at our landing place . the beached skiff had brought the captain ashore . i spotted him standing on a chunk of basalt . his instruments were beside him . his eyes were focused on the northern horizon , along which the sun was sweeping in its extended arc .",28
"it was sheer bad luck . our noon sights were still lacking . if we could n't obtain them tomorrow , we would finally have to give up any hope of fixing our position .",24
"in essence , it was precisely march 20 . tomorrow , the 21st , was the day of the equinox ; the sun would disappear below the horizon for six months not counting refraction , and after its disappearance the long polar night would begin . following the september equinox , the sun had emerged above the northerly horizon , rising in long spirals until december 21 . at that time , the summer solstice of these southernmost districts , the sun had started back down , and tomorrow it would cast its last rays .",53

"there once more , through the panels opening into these caribbean waters ten meters below the surface of the waves , i found so many fascinating exhibits to describe in my daily notes ! among other zoophytes there were portuguese men - of - war known by the name physalia pelagica , like big , oblong bladders with a pearly sheen , spreading their membranes to the wind , letting their blue tentacles drift like silken threads ; to the eye delightful jellyfish , to the touch actual nettles that ooze a corrosive liquid . among the articulates there were annelid worms one and a half meters long , furnished with a pink proboscis , equipped with 1,700 organs of locomotion , snaking through the waters , and as they went , throwing off every gleam in the solar spectrum . from the fish branch there were manta rays , enormous cartilaginous fish ten feet long and weighing 600 pounds , their pectoral fin triangular , their midback slightly arched , their eyes attached to the edges of the face at the front of the head ; they floated like wreckage from a ship , sometimes fastening onto our windows like opaque shutters . there were american triggerfish for which nature has ground only black and white pigments , feather - shaped gobies that were long and plump with yellow fins and jutting jaws , sixteen - decimeter mackerel with short , sharp teeth , covered with small scales , and related to the albacore species . next came swarms of red mullet corseted in gold stripes from head to tail , their shining fins all aquiver , genuine masterpieces of jewelry , formerly sacred to the goddess diana , much in demand by rich romans , and about which the old saying goes : "" he who catches them does n't eat them ! "" finally , adorned with emerald ribbons and dressed in velvet and silk , golden angelfish passed before our eyes like courtiers in the paintings of veronese ; spurred gilthead stole by with their swift thoracic fins ; thread herring fifteen inches long were wrapped in their phosphorescent glimmers ; gray mullet thrashed the sea with their big fleshy tails ; red salmon seemed to mow the waves with their slicing pectorals ; and silver moonfish , worthy of their name , rose on the horizon of the waters like the whitish reflections of many moons .",211
"how many other marvelous new specimens i still could have observed if , little by little , the nautilus had n't settled to the lower strata ! its slanting fins drew it to depths of 2,000 and 3,500 meters . there animal life was represented by nothing more than sea lilies , starfish , delightful crinoids with bell - shaped heads like little chalices on straight stems , top - shell snails , blood - red tooth shells , and fissurella snails , a large species of coastal mollusk .",9

"by then the nautilus had returned to the surface of the waves . stationed on the top steps , one of the seamen undid the bolts of the hatch . but he had scarcely unscrewed the nuts when the hatch flew up with tremendous violence , obviously pulled open by the suckers on a devilfish 's arm .",32

"but the skies became more and more threatening . there were conspicuous signs of a hurricane on the way . the atmosphere was turning white and milky . slender sheaves of cirrus clouds were followed on the horizon by layers of nimbocumulus . other low clouds fled swiftly . the sea grew towering , inflated by long swells . every bird had disappeared except a few petrels , friends of the storms . the barometer fell significantly , indicating a tremendous tension in the surrounding haze . the mixture in our stormglass decomposed under the influence of the electricity charging the air . a struggle of the elements was approaching .",61
"meanwhile i was carefully examining these unleashed breakers . they measured up to fifteen meters in height over a length of 150 to 175 meters , and the speed of their propagation ( half that of the wind ) was fifteen meters per second . their volume and power increased with the depth of the waters . i then understood the role played by these waves , which trap air in their flanks and release it in the depths of the sea where its oxygen brings life . their utmost pressure -- it has been calculated-- can build to 3,000 kilograms on every square foot of surface they strike . it was such waves in the hebrides that repositioned a stone block weighing 84,000 pounds . it was their relatives in the tidal wave on december 23 , 1854 , that toppled part of the japanese city of tokyo , then went that same day at 700 kilometers per hour to break on the beaches of america .",93
"after nightfall the storm grew in intensity . as in the 1860 cyclone on réunion island , the barometer fell to 710 millimeters . at the close of day , i saw a big ship passing on the horizon , struggling painfully . it lay to at half steam in an effort to hold steady on the waves . it must have been a steamer on one of those lines out of new york to liverpool or le havre . it soon vanished into the shadows .",61
"the rain was followed by a downpour of fire . droplets of water changed into exploding tufts . you would have thought captain nemo was courting a death worthy of himself , seeking to be struck by lightning . in one hideous pitching movement , the nautilus reared its steel spur into the air like a lightning rod , and i saw long sparks shoot down it .",20

"then a sudden thought terrified me . captain nemo had left his stateroom . he was in the same lounge i had to cross in order to escape . there i would encounter him one last time . he would see me , perhaps speak to me ! one gesture from him could obliterate me , a single word shackle me to his vessel !",9

"i crept forward through the nautilus 's dark gangways , pausing after each step to curb the pounding of my heart . i arrived at the corner door of the lounge . i opened it gently . the lounge was plunged in profound darkness . chords from the organ were reverberating faintly . captain nemo was there . he did n't see me . even in broad daylight i doubt that he would have noticed me , so completely was he immersed in his trance .",73
was it a vow of repentance that had just escaped from this man 's conscience . . . ?,7
suddenly a noise from the ship 's interior became audible . voices were answering each other hurriedly . what was it ? had they spotted our escape ? i felt ned land sliding a dagger into my hand .,22
the maelstrom ! could a more frightening name have rung in our ears under more frightening circumstances ? were we lying in the dangerous waterways off the norwegian coast ? was the nautilus being dragged into this whirlpool just as the skiff was about to detach from its plating ?,8
"this was where the nautilus had been sent accidentally-- or perhaps deliberately -- by its captain . it was sweeping around in a spiral whose radius kept growing smaller and smaller . the skiff , still attached to the ship 's plating , was likewise carried around at dizzying speed . i could feel us whirling . i was experiencing that accompanying nausea that follows such continuous spinning motions . we were in dread , in the last stages of sheer horror , our blood frozen in our veins , our nerves numb , drenched in cold sweat as if from the throes of dying ! and what a noise around our frail skiff ! what roars echoing from several miles away ! what crashes from the waters breaking against sharp rocks on the seafloor , where the hardest objects are smashed , where tree trunks are worn down and worked into "" a shaggy fur , "" as norwegians express it !",5
just now we ca n't even dream of returning to france . travel between upper norway and the south is limited . so i have to wait for the arrival of a steamboat that provides bimonthly service from north cape .,24
"so it is here , among these gallant people who have taken us in , that i 'm reviewing my narrative of these adventures . it is accurate . not a fact has been omitted , not a detail has been exaggerated . it 's the faithful record of this inconceivable expedition into an element now beyond human reach , but where progress will someday make great inroads .",10
"will anyone believe me ? i do n't know . ultimately it 's unimportant . what i can now assert is that i 've earned the right to speak of these seas , beneath which in less than ten months , i 've cleared 20,000 leagues in this underwater tour of the world that has shown me so many wonders across the pacific , the indian ocean , the red sea , the mediterranean , the atlantic , the southernmost and northernmost seas !",23
"it was a mystery all insoluble ; nor could i grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as i pondered . i was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion , that while , beyond doubt , there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us , still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth .",49

"his reserve had been always excessive and habitual . i was aware , however , that his very ancient family had been noted , time out of mind , for a peculiar sensibility of temperament , displaying itself , through long ages , in many works of exalted art , and manifested , of late , in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity , as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies , perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognizable beauties , of musical science .",2

i have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment — that of looking down within the tarn — had been to deepen the first singular impression .,21

"and it might have been for this reason only , that , when i again uplifted my eyes to the house itself , from its image in the pool , there grew in my mind a strange fancy — a fancy so ridiculous , indeed , that i but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me .",3
"i had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity — an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven , but which had reeked up from the decayed trees , and the gray wall , and the silent tarn — a pestilent and mystic vapor , dull , sluggish , faintly discernible , and leaden - hued .",33

"shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream , i scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building .",7
the discoloration of ages had been great .,4
"no portion of the masonry had fallen ; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts , and the crumbling condition of the individual stones . in this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old wood - work which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault , with no disturbance from the breath of the external air .",5

"perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure , which , extending from the roof of the building in front , made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction , until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn .",8
"while the objects around me — while the carvings of the ceilings , the sombre tapestries of the walls , the ebon blackness of the floors , and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as i strode , were but matters to which , or to such as which , i had been accustomed from my infancy — while i hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all this — i still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up .",51
"upon my entrance , usher rose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length , and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it , i at first thought , of an overdone cordiality — of the constrained effort of the ennuyé man of the world .",12

"surely , man had never before so terribly altered , in so brief a period , as had roderick usher !",17
"for something of this nature i had indeed been prepared , no less by his letter , than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits , and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament .",6
"some of these , as he detailed them , interested and bewildered me ; although , perhaps , the terms and the general manner of the narration had their weight .",27
"i have , indeed , no abhorrence of danger , except in its absolute effect — in terror .",1
"he was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted , and whence , for many years , he had never ventured forth — in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be re - stated — an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion had , by dint of long sufferance , he said , obtained over his spirit — an effect which the physique of the gray walls and turrets , and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down , had , at length , brought about upon the morale of his existence .",24

"while he spoke , the lady madeline ( for so was she called ) passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment , and , without having noticed my presence , disappeared .",27
"i have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer , with the exception of certain effects of stringed instruments .",1
"they must have been , and were , in the notes , as well as in the words of his wild fantasias ( for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations ) , the result of that intense mental collectedness and concentration to which i have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement .",2
the words of one of these rhapsodies i have easily remembered .,8
"i well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad , led us into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of usher ’s which i mention not so much on account of its novelty ( for other men * have thought thus ) , as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it .",42
"the conditions of the sentience had been here , he imagined , fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stones — in the order of their arrangement , as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread them , and of the decayed trees which stood around — above all , in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement , and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn .",5
"our books — the books which , for years , had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalid — were , as might be supposed , in strict keeping with this character of phantasm .",10
"i could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work , and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac , when , one evening , having informed me abruptly that the lady madeline was no more , he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight ( previously to its final interment ) , in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building .",27
"i will not deny that when i called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom i met upon the staircase , on the day of my arrival at the house , i had no desire to oppose what i regarded as at best but a harmless , and by no means an unnatural , precaution .",34
"the body having been encoffined , we two alone bore it to its rest .",2
"the vault in which we placed it ( and which had been so long unopened that our torches , half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere , gave us little opportunity for investigation ) was small , damp , and entirely without means of admission for light ; lying , at great depth , immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment .",10
"the door , of massive iron , had been , also , similarly protected .",7
"having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror , we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin , and looked upon the face of the tenant .",0
"a striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention ; and usher , divining , perhaps , my thoughts , murmured out some few words from which i learned that the deceased and himself had been twins , and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them .",50
"we replaced and screwed down the lid , and , having secured the door of iron , made our way , with toil , into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house .",10
"and now , some days of bitter grief having elapsed , an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend .",8
his ordinary manner had vanished .,3
i struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me .,8
"overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror , unaccountable yet unendurable , i threw on my clothes with haste ( for i felt that i should sleep no more during the night ) , and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which i had fallen , by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment .",46
"i had taken but few turns in this manner , when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention .",1
"“ and you have not seen it ? ” he said abruptly , after having stared about him for some moments in silence—“you have not then seen it?—but , stay ! you shall . ”",3

"“ and you have not seen it ? ” he said abruptly , after having stared about him for some moments in silence—“you have not then seen it?—but , stay ! you shall . ”",23
"thus speaking , and having carefully shaded his lamp , he hurried to one of the casements , and threw it freely open to the storm .",4
"i say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this — yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars , nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning .",16
"“ you must not — you shall not behold this ! ” said i , shuddering , to usher , as i led him , with a gentle violence , from the window to a seat . “ these appearances , which bewilder you , are merely electrical phenomena not uncommon — or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the tarn .",58
"the antique volume which i had taken up was the “ mad trist ” of sir launcelot canning ; but i had called it a favorite of usher ’s more in sad jest than in earnest ; for , in truth , there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend .",21

"i had arrived at that well - known portion of the story where ethelred , the hero of the trist , having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit , proceeds to make good an entrance by force .",21
"it was , beyond doubt , the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention ; for , amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements , and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm , the sound , in itself , had nothing , surely , which should have interested or disturbed me .",44

"and ethelred uplifted his mace , and struck upon the head of the dragon , which fell before him , and gave up his pesty breath , with a shriek so horrid and harsh , and withal so piercing , that ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it , the like whereof was never before heard . ”",42
"i was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question ; although , assuredly , a strange alteration had , during the last few minutes , taken place in his demeanor .",22
"from a position fronting my own , he had gradually brought round his chair , so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber ; and thus i could but partially perceive his features , although i saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly .",8
"having rapidly taken notice of all this , i resumed the narrative of sir launcelot , which thus proceeded :",0
"no sooner had these syllables passed my lips , than — as if a shield of brass had indeed , at the moment , fallen heavily upon a floor of silver — i became aware of a distinct , hollow , metallic , and clangorous , yet apparently muffled , reverberation .",2
"“ not hear it?—yes , i hear it , and have heard it .",10
we have put her living in the tomb !,1
"as if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the potency of a spell , the huge antique panels to which the speaker pointed threw slowly back , upon the instant , their ponderous and ebony jaws .",10
"for a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold — then , with a low moaning cry , fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother , and in her violent and now final death - agonies , bore him to the floor a corpse , and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated .",59
"suddenly there shot along the path a wild light , and i turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued ; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me .",21
"alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank , and of having nothing to do : once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading , but it had no pictures or conversations in it , ' and what is the use of a book , ' thought alice ' without pictures or conversation ?

"the rabbit - hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way , and then dipped suddenly down , so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well .",24
"down , down , down . would the fall never come to an end ! ' i wonder how many miles i 've fallen by this time ? ' she said aloud . ' i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth . let me see : that would be four thousand miles down , i think-- '",22
"alice was not a bit hurt , and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment : she looked up , but it was all dark overhead ; before her was another long passage , and the white rabbit was still in sight , hurrying down it . there was not a moment to be lost : away went alice like the wind , and was just in time to hear it say , as it turned a corner , ' oh my ears and whiskers , how late it 's getting ! ' she was close behind it when she turned the corner , but the rabbit was no longer to be seen : she found herself in a long , low hall , which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof . there were doors all round the hall , but they were all locked ; and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other , trying every door , she walked sadly down the middle , wondering how she was ever to get out again .",158
"alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage , not much larger than a rat - hole : she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw . how she longed to get out of that dark hall , and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains , but she could not even get her head though the doorway ; ' and even if my head would go through , ' thought poor alice , ' it would be of very little use without my shoulders . oh , how i wish i could shut up like a telescope ! i think i could , if i only know how to begin . ' for , you see , so many out - of - the - way things had happened lately , that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible . there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door , so she went back to the table , half hoping she might find another key on it , or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes : this time she found a little bottle on it , ( ' which certainly was not here before , ' said alice , ) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label , with the words ' drink me ' beautifully printed on it in large letters .",145

"it was all very well to say ' drink me , ' but the wise little alice was not going to do that in a hurry . ' no , i 'll look first , ' she said , ' and see whether it 's marked "" poison "" or not ' ; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt , and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things , all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them : such as , that a red - hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long ; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife , it usually bleeds ; and she had never forgotten that , if you drink much from a bottle marked ' poison , ' it is almost certain to disagree with you , sooner or later .",55

"however , this bottle was not marked ' poison , ' so alice ventured to taste it , and finding it very nice , ( it had , in fact , a sort of mixed flavour of cherry - tart , custard , pine - apple , roast turkey , toffee , and hot buttered toast , ) she very soon finished it off .",26
"after a while , finding that nothing more happened , she decided on going into the garden at once ; but , alas for poor alice ! when she got to the door , she found she had forgotten the little golden key , and when she went back to the table for it , she found she could not possibly reach it : she could see it quite plainly through the glass , and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table , but it was too slippery ; and when she had tired herself out with trying , the poor little thing sat down and cried .",99
"after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance , and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming . it was the white rabbit returning , splendidly dressed , with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other : he came trotting along in a great hurry , muttering to himself as he came , ' oh ! the duchess , the duchess ! oh ! wo n't she be savage if i 've kept her waiting ! ' alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one ; so , when the rabbit came near her , she began , in a low , timid voice , ' if you please , sir-- ' the rabbit started violently , dropped the white kid gloves and the fan , and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go .",88
"as she said this she looked down at her hands , and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbit 's little white kid gloves while she was talking . ' how can i have done that ? ' she thought . ' i must be growing small again . ' she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it , and found that , as nearly as she could guess , she was now about two feet high , and was going on shrinking rapidly : she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding , and she dropped it hastily , just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether .",39
"as she said these words her foot slipped , and in another moment , splash ! she was up to her chin in salt water . her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea , ' and in that case i can go back by railway , ' she said to herself . ( alice had been to the seaside once in her life , and had come to the general conclusion , that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea , some children digging in the sand with wooden spades , then a row of lodging houses , and behind them a railway station . ) however , she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high .",32

"' i wish i had n't cried so much ! ' said alice , as she swam about , trying to find her way out . ' i shall be punished for it now , i suppose , by being drowned in my own tears ! that will be a queer thing , to be sure ! however , everything is queer to - day . '",4

"alice thought the whole thing very absurd , but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh ; and , as she could not think of anything to say , she simply bowed , and took the thimble , looking as solemn as she could . the next thing was to eat the comfits : this caused some noise and confusion , as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs , and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back . however , it was over at last , and they sat down again in a ring , and begged the mouse to tell them something more .",84

"' he took me for his housemaid , ' she said to herself as she ran . ' how surprised he 'll be when he finds out who i am ! but i 'd better take him his fan and gloves -- that is , if i can find them . ' as she said this , she came upon a neat little house , on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name ' w. rabbit ' engraved upon it . she went in without knocking , and hurried upstairs , in great fear lest she should meet the real mary ann , and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves .",117
"by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window , and on it ( as she had hoped ) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves : she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves , and was just going to leave the room , when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking- glass . there was no label this time with the words ' drink me , ' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips . ' i know something interesting is sure to happen , ' she said to herself , ' whenever i eat or drink anything ; so i 'll just see what this bottle does . i do hope it 'll make me grow large again , for really i 'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing ! '",26
"luckily for alice , the little magic bottle had now had its full effect , and she grew no larger : still it was very uncomfortable , and , as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again , no wonder she felt unhappy .",10
"' mary ann ! mary ann ! ' said the voice . ' fetch me my gloves this moment ! ' then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs . alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her , and she trembled till she shook the house , quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit , and had no reason to be afraid of it .",70
"' that you wo n't ' thought alice , and , after waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit just under the window , she suddenly spread out her hand , and made a snatch in the air . she did not get hold of anything , but she heard a little shriek and a fall , and a crash of broken glass , from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber - frame , or something of the sort .",75
"' oh ! so bill 's got to come down the chimney , has he ? ' said alice to herself . ' shy , they seem to put everything upon bill ! i would n't be in bill 's place for a good deal : this fireplace is narrow , to be sure ; but i think i can kick a little ! '",13
"there was a dead silence instantly , and alice thought to herself , ' i wonder what they will do next ! if they had any sense , they 'd take the roof off . ' after a minute or two , they began moving about again , and alice heard the rabbit say , ' a barrowful will do , to begin with . '",24
"' a barrowful of what ? ' thought alice ; but she had not long to doubt , for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window , and some of them hit her in the face . ' i 'll put a stop to this , ' she said to herself , and shouted out , ' you 'd better not do that again ! ' which produced another dead silence .",12
"' and yet what a dear little puppy it was !

' come back ! ' the caterpillar called after her . ' i 've something important to say ! ',13
"alice thought she might as well wait , as she had nothing else to do , and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing . for some minutes it puffed away without speaking , but at last it unfolded its arms , took the hookah out of its mouth again , and said , ' so you think you 're changed , do you ? '",10
"' well , i 've tried to say "" how doth the little busy bee , "" but it all came different ! ' alice replied in a very melancholy voice .",4

"but , now that i 'm perfectly sure i have none ,",9
and have grown most uncommonly fat ;,1
has lasted the rest of my life . ',0
"' not quite right , i 'm afraid , ' said alice , timidly ; ' some of the words have got altered . '",20
"alice said nothing : she had never been so much contradicted in her life before , and she felt that she was losing her temper .",5
"' and now which is which ? ' she said to herself , and nibbled a little of the right - hand bit to try the effect : the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin : it had struck her foot !",41
"' what can all that green stuff be ? ' said alice . ' and where have my shoulders got to ? and oh , my poor hands , how is it i ca n't see you ? ' she was moving them about as she spoke , but no result seemed to follow , except a little shaking among the distant green leaves .",16
"' serpent , i say again ! ' repeated the pigeon , but in a more subdued tone , and added with a kind of sob , ' i 've tried every way , and nothing seems to suit them ! '",29
"' i have n't the least idea what you 're talking about , ' said alice .",2
"alice was more and more puzzled , but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished .",21
"' as if it was n't trouble enough hatching the eggs , ' said the pigeon ; ' but i must be on the look - out for serpents night and day ! why , i have n't had a wink of sleep these three weeks ! '",38
"' i 'm very sorry you 've been annoyed , ' said alice , who was beginning to see its meaning .",6
"alice laughed so much at this , that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her ; and when she next peeped out the fish - footman was gone , and the other was sitting on the ground near the door , staring stupidly up into the sky .",9
"' there 's no sort of use in knocking , ' said the footman , ' and that for two reasons . first , because i 'm on the same side of the door as you are ; secondly , because they 're making such a noise inside , no one could possibly hear you . ' and certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within -- a constant howling and sneezing , and every now and then a great crash , as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces .",90
"' there might be some sense in your knocking , ' the footman went on without attending to her , ' if we had the door between us . for instance , if you were inside , you might knock , and i could let you out , you know . ' he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking , and this alice thought decidedly uncivil . ' but perhaps he ca n't help it , ' she said to herself ; ' his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head . but at any rate he might answer questions.--how am i to get in ? ' she repeated , aloud .",23
"' --or next day , maybe , ' the footman continued in the same tone , exactly as if nothing had happened .",20
"' i do n't know of any that do , ' alice said very politely , feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation .",20
"the baby grunted again , and alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it . there could be no doubt that it had a very turn - up nose , much more like a snout than a real nose ; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby : altogether alice did not like the look of the thing at all . ' but perhaps it was only sobbing , ' she thought , and looked into its eyes again , to see if there were any tears .",29
"no , there were no tears . ' if you 're going to turn into a pig , my dear , ' said alice , seriously , ' i 'll have nothing more to do with you . mind now ! ' the poor little thing sobbed again ( or grunted , it was impossible to say which ) , and they went on for some while in silence .",30
"so she set the little creature down , and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood . ' if it had grown up , ' she said to herself , ' it would have made a dreadfully ugly child : but it makes rather a handsome pig , i think . ' and she began thinking over other children she knew , who might do very well as pigs , and was just saying to herself , ' if one only knew the right way to change them-- ' when she was a little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off .",38
"the cat only grinned when it saw alice . it looked good- natured , she thought : still it had very long claws and a great many teeth , so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect .",19
"' you must be , ' said the cat , ' or you would n't have come here . '",15
"alice was not much surprised at this , she was getting so used to queer things happening . while she was looking at the place where it had been , it suddenly appeared again .",27
"she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the march hare : she thought it must be the right house , because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur . it was so large a house , that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom , and raised herself to about two feet high : even then she walked up towards it rather timidly , saying to herself ' suppose it should be raving mad after all ! i almost wish i 'd gone to see the hatter instead ! '",1

"there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house , and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it : a dormouse was sitting between them , fast asleep , and the other two were using it as a cushion , resting their elbows on it , and talking over its head . ' very uncomfortable for the dormouse , ' thought alice ; ' only , as it 's asleep , i suppose it does n't mind . '",23
"' have some wine , ' the march hare said in an encouraging tone .",1
"' come , we shall have some fun now ! ' thought alice . ' i 'm glad they 've begun asking riddles.--i believe i can guess that , ' she added aloud .",5

"' have you guessed the riddle yet ? ' the hatter said , turning to alice again .",1
"' i have n't the slightest idea , ' said the hatter .",2
"alice sighed wearily . ' i think you might do something better with the time , ' she said , ' than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers . '",28
"' perhaps not , ' alice cautiously replied : ' but i know i have to beat time when i learn music . '",14
"' i 've heard something like it , ' said alice .",2
"here the dormouse shook itself , and began singing in its sleep ' twinkle , twinkle , twinkle , twinkle-- ' and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop .",28
"' yes , that 's it , ' said the hatter with a sigh : ' it 's always tea - time , and we 've no time to wash the things between whiles . '",25
"' they could n't have done that , you know , ' alice gently remarked ; ' they 'd have been ill . '",4
"' they could n't have done that , you know , ' alice gently remarked ; ' they 'd have been ill . '",19
"he moved on as he spoke , and the dormouse followed him : the march hare moved into the dormouse 's place , and alice rather unwillingly took the place of the march hare . the hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change : and alice was a good deal worse off than before , as the march hare had just upset the milk - jug into his plate .",64
"just as she said this , she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it . ' that 's very curious ! ' she thought . ' but everything 's curious today . i think i may as well go in at once . ' and in she went .",13
"seven flung down his brush , and had just begun ' well , of all the unjust things-- ' when his eye chanced to fall upon alice , as she stood watching them , and he checked himself suddenly : the others looked round also , and all of them bowed low .",7
"five and seven said nothing , but looked at two . two began in a low voice , ' why the fact is , you see , miss , this here ought to have been a red rose - tree , and we put a white one in by mistake ; and if the queen was to find it out , we should all have our heads cut off , you know . so you see , miss , we 're doing our best , afore she comes , to-- ' at this moment five , who had been anxiously looking across the garden , called out ' the queen ! the queen !

"alice waited till the eyes appeared , and then nodded . ' it 's no use speaking to it , ' she thought , ' till its ears have come , or at least one of them .

"' i think i should understand that better , ' alice said very politely , ' if i had it written down : but i ca n't quite follow it as you say it . '",18

"the other guests had taken advantage of the queen 's absence , and were resting in the shade : however , the moment they saw her , they hurried back to the game , the queen merely remarking that a moment 's delay would cost them their lives .",3
"all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling with the other players , and shouting ' off with his head ! ' or ' off with her head !

"then the queen left off , quite out of breath , and said to alice , ' have you seen the mock turtle yet ? '",17
"as they walked off together , alice heard the king say in a low voice , to the company generally , ' you are all pardoned . ' ' come , that 's a good thing ! ' she said to herself , for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the queen had ordered .",45
"they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance , sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock , and , as they came nearer , alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break . she pitied him deeply .

"the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates . ' what are they doing ? ' alice whispered to the gryphon . ' they ca n't have anything to put down yet , before the trial 's begun . '",28
"alice could see , as well as if she were looking over their shoulders , that all the jurors were writing down ' stupid things !

' a nice muddle their slates'll be in before the trial 's over ! ' thought alice .",54
"one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked . this of course , alice could not stand , and she went round the court and got behind him , and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away . she did it so quickly that the poor little juror ( it was bill , the lizard ) could not make out at all what had become of it ; so , after hunting all about for it , he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day ; and this was of very little use , as it left no mark on the slate .",4
"the first witness was the hatter . he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread - and - butter in the other . ' i beg pardon , your majesty , ' he began , ' for bringing these in : but i had n't quite finished my tea when i was sent for . '",49

"alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list , feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like , ' --for they have n't got much evidence yet , ' she said to herself . imagine her surprise , when the white rabbit read out , at the top of his shrill little voice , the name ' alice ! '",28
"' here ! ' cried alice , quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes , and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury - box with the edge of her skirt , upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below , and there they lay sprawling about , reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before .",79
"' oh , i beg your pardon ! ' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay , and began picking them up again as quickly as she could , for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head , and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury - box , or they would die .",44
"as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset , and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them , they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident , all except the lizard , who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open , gazing up into the roof of the court .",5

"' there 's more evidence to come yet , please your majesty , ' said the white rabbit , jumping up in a great hurry ; ' this paper has just been picked up . '",29
"' it must have been that , ' said the king , ' unless it was written to nobody , which is n't usual , you know . '",3
