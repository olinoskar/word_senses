"at these words the reclining figure rose , and the electric light fell upon his countenance ; a magnificent head , the forehead high , the glance commanding , beard white , hair abundant and falling over the shoulders .",5
"he had doublets cut out of his old clothes and cast - off cloaks for mousqueton , and thanks to a very intelligent tailor , who made his clothes look as good as new by turning them , and whose wife was suspected of wishing to make porthos descend from his aristocratic habits , mousqueton made a very good figure when attending on his master .",59
"this speech was perfectly agreeable to cacambo . a fondness for roving , for making a figure in their own country , and for boasting of what they had seen in their travels , was so powerful in our two wanderers that they resolved to be no longer happy ; and demanded permission of the king to quit the country .",16
"within the arch , the bulky figure of sir george lynn , whom mr . rochester had likewise chosen , was seen enveloped in a white sheet : before him , on a table , lay open a large book ; and at his side stood amy eshton , draped in mr . rochester 's cloak , and holding a book in her hand .",6

"from that day forward , who knows where the nautilus took us in the north atlantic basin ? always at incalculable speed ! always amid the high arctic mists ! did it call at the capes of spitzbergen or the shores of novaya zemlya ? did it visit such uncharted seas as the white sea , the kara sea , the gulf of ob , the lyakhov islands , or those unknown beaches on the siberian coast ? i 'm unable to say . i lost track of the passing hours . time was in abeyance on the ship 's clocks . as happens in the polar regions , it seemed that night and day no longer followed their normal sequence . i felt myself being drawn into that strange domain where the overwrought imagination of edgar allan poe was at home . like his fabled arthur gordon pym , i expected any moment to see that "" shrouded human figure , very far larger in its proportions than any dweller among men , "" thrown across the cataract that protects the outskirts of the pole !",160

"fix took up a position , and carefully examined each face and figure which made its appearance . presently one of the passengers , after vigorously pushing his way through the importunate crowd of porters , came up to him and politely asked if he could point out the english consulate , at the same time showing a passport which he wished to have visaed . fix instinctively took the passport , and with a rapid glance read the description of its bearer . an involuntary motion of surprise nearly escaped him , for the description in the passport was identical with that of the bank robber which he had received from scotland yard .",12

"she laughed again . her teeth showed like white seeds in a scarlet fruit . upstairs , in his own room , dorian gray was lying on a sofa , with terror in every tingling fibre of his body . life had suddenly become too hideous a burden for him to bear . the dreadful death of the unlucky beater , shot in the thicket like a wild animal , had seemed to him to pre - figure death for himself also . he had nearly swooned at what lord henry had said in a chance mood of cynical jesting .",77

"how different it was with material things ! where had they passed to ? where was the great crocus - coloured robe , on which the gods fought against the giants , that had been worked by brown girls for the pleasure of athena ? where the huge velarium that nero had stretched across the colosseum at rome , that titan sail of purple on which was represented the starry sky , and apollo driving a chariot drawn by white , gilt - reined steeds ? he longed to see the curious table - napkins wrought for the priest of the sun , on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast ; the mortuary cloth of king chilperic , with its three hundred golden bees ; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the bishop of pontus and were figured with "" lions , panthers , bears , dogs , forests , rocks , hunters -- all , in fact , that a painter can copy from nature "" ; and the coat that charles of orleans once wore , on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning "" madame , je suis tout joyeux , "" the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread , and each note , of square shape in those days , formed with four pearls .",148

"yet one had ancestors in literature as well as in one 's own race , nearer perhaps in type and temperament , many of them , and certainly with an influence of which one was more absolutely conscious . there were times when it appeared to dorian gray that the whole of history was merely the record of his own life , not as he had lived it in act and circumstance , but as his imagination had created it for him , as it had been in his brain and in his passions . he felt that he had known them all , those strange terrible figures that had passed across the stage of the world and made sin so marvellous and evil so full of subtlety . it seemed to him that in some mysterious way their lives had been his own .",107

"i sometimes regretted that i was not handsomer ; i sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks , a straight nose , and small cherry mouth ; i desired to be tall , stately , and finely developed in figure ; i felt it a misfortune that i was so little , so pale , and had features so irregular and so marked .",38

"looking down on this very scene , there stood upon the fourth of may , eighteen hundred and forty - seven , a solitary traveller . his appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region . an observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty . his face was lean and haggard , and the brown parchment - like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones ; his long , brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white ; his eyes were sunken in his head , and burned with an unnatural lustre ; while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton . as he stood , he leaned upon his weapon for support , and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution . his gaunt face , however , and his clothes , which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs , proclaimed what it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance . the man was dying â€” dying from hunger and from thirst .",148

"i was dreadfully shocked at the burning of the two jews , and the honest biscayan who married his godmother ; but how great was my surprise , my consternation , and concern , when i beheld a figure so like pangloss , dressed in a sanbenito and mitre !",38
"in the deep shade , at the farther end of the room , a figure ran backwards and forwards . what it was , whether beast or human being , one could not , at first sight , tell : it grovelled , seemingly , on all fours ; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal : but it was covered with clothing , and a quantity of dark , grizzled hair , wild as a mane , hid its head and face .",14

"yes , the lad was premature . he was gathering his harvest while it was yet spring . the pulse and passion of youth were in him , but he was becoming self - conscious . it was delightful to watch him . with his beautiful face , and his beautiful soul , he was a thing to wonder at . it was no matter how it all ended , or was destined to end . he was like one of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play , whose joys seem to be remote from one , but whose sorrows stir one 's sense of beauty , and whose wounds are like red roses .",83
"the door nearest me opened , and a servant came out,--a woman of between thirty and forty ; a set , square - made figure , red - haired , and with a hard , plain face : any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely be conceived .",24
"mrs . vane glanced at her , and with one of those false theatrical gestures that so often become a mode of second nature to a stage - player , clasped her in her arms . at this moment , the door opened and a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room . he was thick - set of figure , and his hands and feet were large and somewhat clumsy in movement . he was not so finely bred as his sister . one would hardly have guessed the close relationship that existed between them . mrs . vane fixed her eyes on him and intensified her smile . she mentally elevated her son to the dignity of an audience . she felt sure that the tableau was interesting .",62
"i looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script . at the head was written : "" baskerville hall , "" and below in large , scrawling figures : "" 1742 . """,31
"and so it was arranged . resisting stapleton 's offer of hospitality , holmes and i set off to baskerville hall , leaving the naturalist to return alone . looking back we saw the figure moving slowly away over the broad moor , and behind him that one black smudge on the silvered slope which showed where the man was lying who had come so horribly to his end .",34

"ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes , jefferson hope had the scanty provisions and water , while lucy had a small bundle containing a few of her more valued possessions . opening the window very slowly and carefully , they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night , and then one by one passed through into the little garden . with bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it , and gained the shelter of the hedge , which they skirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfields . they had just reached this point when the young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the shadow , where they lay silent and trembling .",70
it was the work of the rushing gust â€” but then without those doors there did stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady madeline of usher .,21
"' come , let 's try the first figure ! ' said the mock turtle to the gryphon . ' we can do without lobsters , you know . which shall sing ? '",8
""" seven to five !

"the prediction of the mormon was only too well fulfilled . whether it was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which she had been forced , poor lucy never held up her head again , but pined away and died within a month . her sottish husband , who had married her principally for the sake of john ferrier 's property , did not affect any great grief at his bereavement ; but his other wives mourned over her , and sat up with her the night before the burial , as is the mormon custom . they were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning , when , to their inexpressible fear and astonishment , the door was flung open , and a savage - looking , weather - beaten man in tattered garments strode into the room . without a glance or a word to the cowering women , he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of lucy ferrier . stooping over her , he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead , and then , snatching up her hand , he took the wedding - ring from her finger . "" she shall not be buried in that , "" he cried with a fierce snarl , and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone . so strange and so brief was the episode , that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it , had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared .",170
"the longest of the only two streets that rejkiavik possesses was parallel with the beach . here live the merchants and traders , in wooden cabins made of red planks set horizontally ; the other street , running west , ends at the little lake between the house of the bishop and other non - commercial people . i had soon explored these melancholy ways ; here and there i got a glimpse of faded turf , looking like a worn - out bit of carpet , or some appearance of a kitchen garden , the sparse vegetables of which ( potatoes , cabbages , and lettuces ) , would have figured appropriately upon a lilliputian table . a few sickly wallflowers were trying to enjoy the air and sunshine .",111

"after leaving these delightful islands to the protection of the french flag , the nautilus covered about 2,000 miles from december 4 to the 11th . its navigating was marked by an encounter with an immense school of squid , unusual mollusks that are near neighbors of the cuttlefish . french fishermen give them the name "" cuckoldfish , "" and they belong to the class cephalopoda , family dibranchiata , consisting of themselves together with cuttlefish and argonauts . the naturalists of antiquity made a special study of them , and these animals furnished many ribald figures of speech for soapbox orators in the greek marketplace , as well as excellent dishes for the tables of rich citizens , if we 're to believe athenaeus , a greek physician predating galen .",97
