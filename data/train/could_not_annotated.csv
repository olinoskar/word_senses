"another reflection was of great use to me , and doubtless would be so to any one that should fall into such distress as mine was ; and this was , to compare my present condition with what i at first expected it would be ; nay , with what it would certainly have been , if the good providence of god had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up nearer to the shore , where i not only could come at her , but could bring what i got out of her to the shore , for my relief and comfort ; without which , i had wanted for tools to work , weapons for defence , and gunpowder and shot for getting my food .",81

"besides this , i arrived at an unexpected perfection in my earthenware , and contrived well enough to make them with a wheel , which i found infinitely easier and better ; because i made things round and shaped , which before were filthy things indeed to look on . but i think i was never more vain of my own performance , or more joyful for anything i found out , than for my being able to make a tobacco - pipe ; and though it was a very ugly , clumsy thing when it was done , and only burned red , like other earthenware , yet as it was hard and firm , and would draw the smoke , i was exceedingly comforted with it , for i had been always used to smoke ; and there were pipes in the ship , but i forgot them at first , not thinking there was tobacco in the island ; and afterwards , when i searched the ship again , i could not come at any pipes .",173

"after friday and i became more intimately acquainted , and that he could understand almost all i said to him , and speak pretty fluently , though in broken english , to me , i acquainted him with my own history , or at least so much of it as related to my coming to this place : how i had lived there , and how long ; i let him into the mystery , for such it was to him , of gunpowder and bullet , and taught him how to shoot . i gave him a knife , which he was wonderfully delighted with ; and i made him a belt , with a frog hanging to it , such as in england we wear hangers in ; and in the frog , instead of a hanger , i gave him a hatchet , which was not only as good a weapon in some cases , but much more useful upon other occasions .",12

"upon the whole , as i found by all his discourse a settled affection to me , and that nothing could part him from me , so i found all the foundation of his desire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent affection to the people , and his hopes of my doing them good ; a thing which , as i had no notion of myself , so i had not the least thought or intention , or desire of undertaking it . but still i found a strong inclination to attempting my escape , founded on the supposition gathered from the discourse , that there were seventeen bearded men there ; and therefore , without any more delay , i went to work with friday to find out a great tree proper to fell , and make a large periagua , or canoe , to undertake the voyage . there were trees enough in the island to have built a little fleet , not of periaguas or canoes , but even of good , large vessels ; but the main thing i looked at was , to get one so near the water that we might launch it when it was made , to avoid the mistake i committed at first .",20

"a few paces away , a monstrous , meter - high sea spider was staring at me with beady eyes , poised to spring at me . although my diving suit was heavy enough to protect me from this animal 's bites , i could n't keep back a shudder of horror . just then conseil woke up , together with the nautilus 's sailor . captain nemo alerted his companion to this hideous crustacean , which a swing of the rifle butt quickly brought down , and i watched the monster 's horrible legs writhing in dreadful convulsions .",44
"i say 150 meters , although i had no instruments for estimating this distance . but i knew that the sun 's rays , even in the clearest seas , could reach no deeper . so at precisely this point the darkness became profound . not a single object was visible past ten paces . consequently , i had begun to grope my way when suddenly i saw the glow of an intense white light . captain nemo had just activated his electric device . his companion did likewise . conseil and i followed suit . by turning a switch , i established contact between the induction coil and the glass spiral , and the sea , lit up by our four lanterns , was illuminated for a radius of twenty - five meters .",30
"the settlers rowed round the hull , and in proportion as the tide went down , they could ascertain , if not the cause which had occasioned the catastrophe , at least the effect produced .",17
"finally , at around four o'clock , this marvelous excursion came to an end . a wall of superb rocks stood before us , imposing in its sheer mass : a pile of gigantic stone blocks , an enormous granite cliffside pitted with dark caves but not offering a single gradient we could climb up . this was the underpinning of crespo island . this was land .",52
"our return journey began . captain nemo resumed the lead in our little band , always heading forward without hesitation . i noted that we did n't follow the same path in returning to the nautilus . this new route , very steep and hence very arduous , quickly took us close to the surface of the sea . but this return to the upper strata was n't so sudden that decompression took place too quickly , which could have led to serious organic disorders and given us those internal injuries so fatal to divers . with great promptness , the light reappeared and grew stronger ; and the refraction of the sun , already low on the horizon , again ringed the edges of various objects with the entire color spectrum .",78
"another unusual effect . heavy clouds passed above us , forming and fading swiftly . but after thinking it over , i realized that these so - called clouds were caused simply by the changing densities of the long ground swells , and i even spotted the foaming "" white caps "" that their breaking crests were proliferating over the surface of the water . lastly , i could n't help seeing the actual shadows of large birds passing over our heads , swiftly skimming the surface of the sea .",68
"this incident did not interrupt our walk . for two hours we were sometimes led over plains of sand , sometimes over prairies of seaweed that were quite arduous to cross . in all honesty , i was dead tired by the time i spotted a hazy glow half a mile away , cutting through the darkness of the waters . it was the nautilus 's beacon . within twenty minutes we would be on board , and there i could breathe easy again -- because my tank 's current air supply seemed to be quite low in oxygen . but i was reckoning without an encounter that slightly delayed our arrival .",80
"my blood turned cold in my veins ! i saw that we were under threat from a fearsome pair of sharks . they were blue sharks , dreadful man - eaters with enormous tails , dull , glassy stares , and phosphorescent matter oozing from holes around their snouts . they were like monstrous fireflies that could thoroughly pulverize a man in their iron jaws ! i do n't know if conseil was busy with their classification , but as for me , i looked at their silver bellies , their fearsome mouths bristling with teeth , from a viewpoint less than scientific-- more as a victim than as a professor of natural history .",56
"the colonists could easily go fore and aft , after having removed the cases as they were extricated .",2
"the nets were hauled on board . they were a breed of trawl resembling those used off the normandy coast , huge pouches held half open by a floating pole and a chain laced through the lower meshes . trailing in this way from these iron glove makers , the resulting receptacles scoured the ocean floor and collected every marine exhibit in their path . that day they gathered up some unusual specimens from these fish - filled waterways : anglerfish whose comical movements qualify them for the epithet "" clowns , "" black commerson anglers equipped with their antennas , undulating triggerfish encircled by little red bands , bloated puffers whose venom is extremely insidious , some olive - hued lampreys , snipefish covered with silver scales , cutlass fish whose electrocuting power equals that of the electric eel and the electric ray , scaly featherbacks with brown crosswise bands , greenish codfish , several varieties of goby , etc . ; finally , some fish of larger proportions : a one - meter jack with a prominent head , several fine bonito from the genus scomber decked out in the colors blue and silver , and three magnificent tuna whose high speeds could n't save them from our trawl .",204
"i estimate that this cast of the net brought in more than 1,000 pounds of fish . it was a fine catch but not surprising . in essence , these nets stayed in our wake for several hours , incarcerating an entire aquatic world in prisons made of thread . so we were never lacking in provisions of the highest quality , which the nautilus 's speed and the allure of its electric light could continually replenish .",74
"pencroft was convinced by the evidence of his own eyes that the destruction of the "" speedy "" could not be attributed to an explosion .",18
""" could you quote them to me , so i can double - check them as the need arises ? """,1
"over the ensuing days and weeks , captain nemo was very frugal with his visits . i saw him only at rare intervals . his chief officer regularly fixed the positions i found reported on the chart , and in such a way that i could exactly plot the nautilus 's course .",45
"on november 26 , at three o'clock in the morning , the nautilus cleared the tropic of cancer at longitude 172 degrees . on the 27th it passed in sight of the hawaiian islands , where the famous captain cook met his death on february 14 , 1779 . by then we had fared 4,860 leagues from our starting point . when i arrived on the platform that morning , i saw the island of hawaii two miles to leeward , the largest of the seven islands making up this group . i could clearly distinguish the tilled soil on its outskirts , the various mountain chains running parallel with its coastline , and its volcanoes , crowned by mauna kea , whose elevation is 5,000 meters above sea level . among other specimens from these waterways , our nets brought up some peacock - tailed flabellarian coral , polyps flattened into stylish shapes and unique to this part of the ocean .",93
my parents died before i could know them .,5
"the nautilus kept to its southeasterly heading . on december 1 it cut the equator at longitude 142 degrees , and on the 4th of the same month , after a quick crossing marked by no incident , we raised the marquesas islands . three miles off , in latitude 8 degrees 57 ' south and longitude 139 degrees 32 ' west , i spotted martin point on nuku hiva , chief member of this island group that belongs to france . i could make out only its wooded mountains on the horizon , because captain nemo hated to hug shore . there our nets brought up some fine fish samples : dolphinfish with azure fins , gold tails , and flesh that 's unrivaled in the entire world , wrasse from the genus hologymnosus that were nearly denuded of scales but exquisite in flavor , knifejaws with bony beaks , yellowish albacore that were as tasty as bonito , all fish worth classifying in the ship 's pantry .",83
"a week after the castrophe -- or , rather , after the fortunate , though inexplicable , event to which the colony owed its preservation -- nothing more could be seen of the vessel , even at low tide .",28
"what a scene ! we stood dumbstruck , hearts pounding , before this shipwreck caught in the act , as if it had been photographed in its final moments , so to speak ! and already i could see enormous sharks moving in , eyes ablaze , drawn by the lure of human flesh !",37
"meanwhile , turning , the nautilus made a circle around the sinking ship , and for an instant i could read the board on its stern : the florida",19
"d‚Äôartagnan could not get over the surprise created in him by this minister , who thus open - handed , sported with men and millions .",1
"he wished to have the young man at hand -- not that he at all mistrusted him , but for the sake of having someone to whom he could constantly talk of the queen .",28
"i could observe these strange walls quite closely : our sounding lines indicated that they dropped perpendicularly for more than 300 meters , and our electric beams made the bright limestone positively sparkle .",1
"on the day after the morrow , by eleven o‚Äôclock , the two diamond studs were finished , and they were so completely imitated , so perfectly alike , that buckingham could not tell the new ones from the old ones , and experts in such matters would have been deceived as he was .",31
"when the nautilus returned to the surface of the ocean , i could take in reao island over its whole flat , wooded expanse . obviously its madreporic rocks had been made fertile by tornadoes and thunderstorms . one day , carried off by a hurricane from neighboring shores , some seed fell onto these limestone beds , mixing with decomposed particles of fish and marine plants to form vegetable humus . propelled by the waves , a coconut arrived on this new coast . its germ took root . its tree grew tall , catching steam off the water . a brook was born . little by little , vegetation spread . tiny animals -- worms , insects -- rode ashore on tree trunks snatched from islands to windward . turtles came to lay their eggs . birds nested in the young trees . in this way animal life developed , and drawn by the greenery and fertile soil , man appeared . and that 's how these islands were formed , the immense achievement of microscopic animals .",12
"they discovered i could draw : their pencils and colour - boxes were immediately at my service . my skill , greater in this one point than theirs , surprised and charmed them .",3
"cyrus harding could not be mistaken , as , during the war of the union , he had had occasion to try these terrible engines of destruction .",2
"i will add that it was he who guided that chest , provided with everything we wanted , and stranded it on flotsam point ; that it was he who lighted that fire on the heights of the island , which permitted you to land ; that it was he who fired that bullet found in the body of the peccary ; that it was he who plunged that torpedo into the channel , which destroyed the brig ; in a word , that all those inexplicable events , for which we could not assign a reason , are due to this mysterious being .",92

"as to the guns obtained from the brig , they were pretty pieces of ordnance , which , at pencroft 's entreaty , were hoisted by means of tackle and pulleys , right up into granite house ; embrasures were made between the windows , and the shining muzzles of the guns could soon be seen through the granite cliff .",52
"i would have been deeply interested in visiting this long , 360-league reef , against which the ever - surging sea broke with the fearsome intensity of thunderclaps . but just then the nautilus 's slanting fins took us to great depths , and i could see nothing of those high coral walls . i had to rest content with the various specimens of fish brought up by our nets . among others i noted some long - finned albacore , a species in the genus scomber , as big as tuna , bluish on the flanks , and streaked with crosswise stripes that disappear when the animal dies . these fish followed us in schools and supplied our table with very dainty flesh . we also caught a large number of yellow - green gilthead , half a decimeter long and tasting like dorado , plus some flying gurnards , authentic underwater swallows that , on dark nights , alternately streak air and water with their phosphorescent glimmers . among mollusks and zoophytes , i found in our trawl 's meshes various species of alcyonarian coral , sea urchins , hammer shells , spurred - star shells , wentletrap snails , horn shells , glass snails . the local flora was represented by fine floating algae : sea tangle , and kelp from the genus macrocystis , saturated with the mucilage their pores perspire , from which i selected a wonderful nemastoma geliniaroidea , classifying it with the natural curiosities in the museum .",45
they both tried to appear as usual ; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could not be entirely conquered or concealed .,19
"in fact , as regards practical effect , the transit described by the ball ought to be as extended as possible , and this tension could only be obtained under the condition that the projectile should be impelled with a very great initial velocity .",25
"here is what those circumstances entailed . two miles to starboard lay gueboroa island , its coastline curving north to west like an immense arm . to the south and east , heads of coral were already on display , left uncovered by the ebbing waters . we had run aground at full tide and in one of those seas whose tides are moderate , an inconvenient state of affairs for floating the nautilus off . however , the ship had n't suffered in any way , so solidly joined was its hull . but although it could neither sink nor split open , it was in serious danger of being permanently attached to these reefs , and that would have been the finish of captain nemo 's submersible .",97

"i could easily have picked off this islander , he stood at such close range ; but i thought it best to wait for an actual show of hostility . between europeans and savages , it 's acceptable for europeans to shoot back but not to attack first .",1
"so the skiff did n't leave shipside that day , much to the displeasure of mr . land who could n't complete his provisions . the adroit canadian spent his time preparing the meat and flour products he had brought from gueboroa island . as for the savages , they went back to shore near eleven o'clock in the morning , when the heads of coral began to disappear under the waves of the rising tide . but i saw their numbers swell considerably on the beach . it was likely that they had come from neighboring islands or from the mainland of papua proper . however , i did n't see one local dugout canoe .",19

"i still waited for a while , then i made my way to the main lounge . its timepiece marked 2:30 . in ten minutes the tide would reach its maximum elevation , and if captain nemo had n't made a rash promise , the nautilus would immediately break free . if not , many months might pass before it could leave its coral bed .",60

"the following day , january 10 , the nautilus resumed its travels in midwater but at a remarkable speed that i estimated to be at least thirty - five miles per hour . the propeller was going so fast i could neither follow nor count its revolutions .",40
"i thought about how this marvelous electric force not only gave motion , heat , and light to the nautilus but even protected it against outside attack , transforming it into a sacred ark no profane hand could touch without being blasted ; my wonderment was boundless , and it went from the submersible itself to the engineer who had created it .",37
"after our position fix , the nautilus 's latitude bearings were modulated to the southwest . our prow pointed to the indian ocean . where would captain nemo 's fancies take us ? would he head up to the shores of asia ? would he pull nearer to the beaches of europe ? unlikely choices for a man who avoided populated areas ! so would he go down south ? would he double the cape of good hope , then cape horn , and push on to the antarctic pole ? finally , would he return to the seas of the pacific , where his nautilus could navigate freely and easily ? time would tell .",106
"for several hours the nautilus drifted in this brilliant tide , and our wonderment grew when we saw huge marine animals cavorting in it , like the fire - dwelling salamanders of myth . in the midst of these flames that did n't burn , i could see swift , elegant porpoises , the tireless pranksters of the seas , and sailfish three meters long , those shrewd heralds of hurricanes , whose fearsome broadswords sometimes banged against the lounge window . then smaller fish appeared : miscellaneous triggerfish , leather jacks , unicornfish , and a hundred others that left stripes on this luminous atmosphere in their course .",46
"meanwhile captain nemo strolled from one end of the platform to the other , not glancing at me , perhaps not even seeing me . his step was firm but less regular than usual . sometimes he would stop , cross his arms over his chest , and observe the sea . what could he be looking for over that immense expanse ? by then the nautilus lay hundreds of miles from the nearest coast !",53

"the next day i woke up with my head unusually clear . much to my surprise , i was in my stateroom . no doubt my companions had been put back in their cabin without noticing it any more than i had . like me , they would have no idea what took place during the night , and to unravel this mystery i could count only on some future happenstance .",64

"while he took his sights with his sextant , one of the nautilus 's sailors-- that muscular man who had gone with us to crespo island during our first underwater excursion -- came up to clean the glass panes of the beacon . i then examined the fittings of this mechanism , whose power was increased a hundredfold by biconvex lenses that were designed like those in a lighthouse and kept its rays productively focused . this electric lamp was so constructed as to yield its maximum illuminating power . in essence , its light was generated in a vacuum , insuring both its steadiness and intensity . such a vacuum also reduced wear on the graphite points between which the luminous arc expanded . this was an important savings for captain nemo , who could n't easily renew them . but under these conditions , wear and tear were almost nonexistent .",135
"all in all , we enjoyed a highly satisfactory state of health . the diet on board agreed with us perfectly , and for my part , i could easily have gone without those changes of pace that ned land , in a spirit of protest , kept taxing his ingenuity to supply us . what 's more , in this constant temperature we did n't even have to worry about catching colds . besides , the ship had a good stock of the madrepore dendrophylia , known in provence by the name sea fennel , and a poultice made from the dissolved flesh of its polyps will furnish an excellent cough medicine .",28

"i repaired to my stateroom . conseil returned to his cabin ; but the canadian , looking rather worried , followed me . our quick trip through the mediterranean had n't allowed him to put his plans into execution , and he could barely conceal his disappointment .",42
"i stayed in my stateroom . i wanted to avoid the captain , to hide from his eyes the agitation overwhelming me . what an agonizing day i spent , torn between my desire to regain my free will and my regret at abandoning this marvelous nautilus , leaving my underwater research incomplete ! how could i relinquish this ocean--""my own atlantic , "" as i liked to call it -- without observing its lower strata , without wresting from it the kinds of secrets that had been revealed to me by the seas of the east indies and the pacific ! i was putting down my novel half read , i was waking up as my dream neared its climax ! how painfully the hours passed , as i sometimes envisioned myself safe on shore with my companions , or , despite my better judgment , as i sometimes wished that some unforeseen circumstances would prevent ned land from carrying out his plans .",55
"as for captain nemo , i wondered what he would make of our escaping , what concern or perhaps what distress it might cause him , and what he would do in the twofold event of our attempt either failing or being found out ! certainly i had no complaints to register with him , on the contrary . never was hospitality more wholehearted than his . yet in leaving him i could n't be accused of ingratitude . no solemn promises bound us to him . in order to keep us captive , he had counted only on the force of circumstances and not on our word of honor . but his avowed intention to imprison us forever on his ship justified our every effort .",72
"as usual , dinner was served me in my stateroom . full of anxiety , i ate little . i left the table at seven o'clock . 120 minutes-- i was keeping track of them -- still separated me from the moment i was to rejoin ned land . my agitation increased . my pulse was throbbing violently . i could n't stand still . i walked up and down , hoping to calm my troubled mind with movement . the possibility of perishing in our reckless undertaking was the least of my worries ; my heart was pounding at the thought that our plans might be discovered before we had left the nautilus , at the thought of being hauled in front of captain nemo and finding him angered , or worse , saddened by my deserting him .",60
"what was the bond between these heroic souls and the soul of captain nemo ? from this collection of portraits could i finally unravel the mystery of his existence ? was he a fighter for oppressed peoples , a liberator of enslaved races ? had he figured in the recent political or social upheavals of this century ? was he a hero of that dreadful civil war in america , a war lamentable yet forever glorious . . . ?",20
"at this point the propeller 's vibrations slowed down appreciably , then they died out altogether . why was the nautilus stopping ? whether this layover would help or hinder ned land 's schemes i could n't have said .",35
"even if he knew it by heart , a man in my disturbed , befuddled condition could n't have quoted a syllable of his own country 's history .",16

"as we moved forward , i heard a kind of pitter - patter above my head . sometimes this noise increased and became a continuous crackle . i soon realized the cause . it was a heavy rainfall rattling on the surface of the waves . instinctively i worried that i might get soaked ! by water in the midst of water ! i could n't help smiling at this outlandish notion . but to tell the truth , wearing these heavy diving suits , you no longer feel the liquid element , you simply think you 're in the midst of air a little denser than air on land , that 's all .",64
"after half an hour of walking , the seafloor grew rocky . jellyfish , microscopic crustaceans , and sea - pen coral lit it faintly with their phosphorescent glimmers . i glimpsed piles of stones covered by a couple million zoophytes and tangles of algae . my feet often slipped on this viscous seaweed carpet , and without my alpenstock i would have fallen more than once . when i turned around , i could still see the nautilus 's whitish beacon , which was starting to grow pale in the distance .",74
"those piles of stones just mentioned were laid out on the ocean floor with a distinct but inexplicable symmetry . i spotted gigantic furrows trailing off into the distant darkness , their length incalculable . there also were other peculiarities i could n't make sense of . it seemed to me that my heavy lead soles were crushing a litter of bones that made a dry crackling noise . so what were these vast plains we were now crossing ? i wanted to ask the captain , but i still did n't grasp that sign language that allowed him to chat with his companions when they went with him on his underwater excursions .",41

"two hours after leaving the nautilus , we had cleared the timberline , and 100 feet above our heads stood the mountain peak , forming a dark silhouette against the brilliant glare that came from its far slope . petrified shrubs rambled here and there in sprawling zigzags . fish rose in a body at our feet like birds startled in tall grass . the rocky mass was gouged with impenetrable crevices , deep caves , unfathomable holes at whose far ends i could hear fearsome things moving around . my blood would curdle as i watched some enormous antenna bar my path , or saw some frightful pincer snap shut in the shadow of some cavity ! a thousand specks of light glittered in the midst of the gloom . they were the eyes of gigantic crustaceans crouching in their lairs , giant lobsters rearing up like spear carriers and moving their claws with a scrap - iron clanking , titanic crabs aiming their bodies like cannons on their carriages , and hideous devilfish intertwining their tentacles like bushes of writhing snakes .",83
"but i could n't linger . captain nemo , on familiar terms with these dreadful animals , no longer minded them . we arrived at a preliminary plateau where still other surprises were waiting for me . there picturesque ruins took shape , betraying the hand of man , not our creator . they were huge stacks of stones in which you could distinguish the indistinct forms of palaces and temples , now arrayed in hosts of blossoming zoophytes , and over it all , not ivy but a heavy mantle of algae and fucus plants .",2

"i thanked the captain and went to look for my two companions , who had n't yet left their cabin . i invited them to follow me , not telling them where we were . they climbed onto the platform . conseil , whom nothing could startle , saw it as a perfectly natural thing to fall asleep under the waves and wake up under a mountain . but ned land had no idea in his head other than to see if this cavern offered some way out .",45
"it was now time to think of returning , for these researches could not be prolonged indefinitely .",12
"a sandy beach unfolded before us , measuring 500 feet at its widest point between the waters of the lake and the foot of the mountain 's walls . via this strand you could easily circle the lake . but the base of these high walls consisted of broken soil over which there lay picturesque piles of volcanic blocks and enormous pumice stones . all these crumbling masses were covered with an enamel polished by the action of underground fires , and they glistened under the stream of electric light from our beacon . stirred up by our footsteps , the mica - rich dust on this beach flew into the air like a cloud of sparks .",33

"such was the region our nautilus was visiting just then : a genuine prairie , a tightly woven carpet of algae , gulfweed , and bladder wrack so dense and compact a craft 's stempost could n't tear through it without difficulty . accordingly , not wanting to entangle his propeller in this weed - choked mass , captain nemo stayed at a depth some meters below the surface of the waves .",35
"i share maury 's view , and i was able to study the phenomenon in this exclusive setting where ships rarely go . above us , huddled among the brown weeds , there floated objects originating from all over : tree trunks ripped from the rocky mountains or the andes and sent floating down the amazon or the mississippi , numerous pieces of wreckage , remnants of keels or undersides , bulwarks staved in and so weighed down with seashells and barnacles , they could n't rise to the surface of the ocean . and the passing years will someday bear out maury 's other view that by collecting in this way over the centuries , these substances will be turned to stone by the action of the waters and will then form inexhaustible coalfields . valuable reserves prepared by farseeing nature for that time when man will have exhausted his mines on the continents .",84

"it was a squid of colossal dimensions , fully eight meters long . it was traveling backward with tremendous speed in the same direction as the nautilus . it gazed with enormous , staring eyes that were tinted sea green . its eight arms ( or more accurately , feet ) were rooted in its head , which has earned these animals the name cephalopod ; its arms stretched a distance twice the length of its body and were writhing like the serpentine hair of the furies . you could plainly see its 250 suckers , arranged over the inner sides of its tentacles and shaped like semispheric capsules . sometimes these suckers fastened onto the lounge window by creating vacuums against it . the monster 's mouth -- a beak made of horn and shaped like that of a parrot -- opened and closed vertically . its tongue , also of horn substance and armed with several rows of sharp teeth , would flicker out from between these genuine shears . what a freak of nature ! a bird 's beak on a mollusk ! its body was spindle - shaped and swollen in the middle , a fleshy mass that must have weighed 20,000 to 25,000 kilograms . its unstable color would change with tremendous speed as the animal grew irritated , passing successively from bluish gray to reddish brown .",89
"what was irritating this mollusk ? no doubt the presence of the nautilus , even more fearsome than itself , and which it could n't grip with its mandibles or the suckers on its arms . and yet what monsters these devilfish are , what vitality our creator has given them , what vigor in their movements , thanks to their owning a triple heart !",23
"i continued sketching . these monsters kept pace in our waters with such precision , they seemed to be standing still , and i could have traced their outlines in miniature on the window . but we were moving at a moderate speed .",24
"thus day followed day ; and as sure as morning came he found that his unseen enemies had kept their register , and had marked up in some conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the month of grace . sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls , sometimes upon the floors , occasionally they were on small placards stuck upon the garden gate or the railings . with all his vigilance john ferrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded . a horror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of them . he became haggard and restless , and his eyes had the troubled look of some hunted creature . he had but one hope in life now , and that was for the arrival of the young hunter from nevada .",80
he could not be mistaken ; milady was in it .,1
"cyrus harding felt the volcanic tufa with which the plain was strewn , and which was but pulverized cinders hardened into solid blocks by time , tremble beneath him , but he could discover no traces of fresh lava .",32
"the poor fellow was done for . who could tear him from such a powerful grip ? even so , captain nemo rushed at the devilfish and with a sweep of the ax hewed one more of its arms . his chief officer struggled furiously with other monsters crawling up the nautilus 's sides . the crew battled with flailing axes . the canadian , conseil , and i sank our weapons into these fleshy masses . an intense , musky odor filled the air . it was horrible .",8
"what rage then drove us against these monsters ! we lost all self - control . ten or twelve devilfish had overrun the nautilus 's platform and sides . we piled helter - skelter into the thick of these sawed - off snakes , which darted over the platform amid waves of blood and sepia ink . it seemed as if these viscous tentacles grew back like the many heads of hydra . at every thrust ned land 's harpoon would plunge into a squid 's sea - green eye and burst it . but my daring companion was suddenly toppled by the tentacles of a monster he could not avoid .",108
"captain nemo reentered his stateroom , and i saw no more of him for a good while . but how sad , despairing , and irresolute he must have felt , to judge from this ship whose soul he was , which reflected his every mood ! the nautilus no longer kept to a fixed heading . it drifted back and forth , riding with the waves like a corpse . its propeller had been disentangled but was barely put to use . it was navigating at random . it could n't tear itself away from the setting of this last struggle , from this sea that had devoured one of its own !",90
"they could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun , and peering down at them as if dissatisfied at their reply .",1
""" the holy four , "" answered ferrier . his mormon experiences had taught him that that was the highest authority to which he could refer .",24
""" pass , and the lord go with you , "" said the voice from above . beyond his post the path broadened out , and the horses were able to break into a trot . looking back , they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon his gun , and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosen people , and that freedom lay before them .",40
"but one distressing circumstance totally thwarted the canadian 's plans . the weather was thoroughly foul . we were approaching waterways where storms are commonplace , the very homeland of tornadoes and cyclones specifically engendered by the gulf stream 's current . to face a frequently raging sea in a frail skiff was a race to certain disaster . ned land conceded this himself . so he champed at the bit , in the grip of an intense homesickness that could be cured only by our escape .",80
"during the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles , and by evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from their enemies . at night - time they chose the base of a beetling crag , where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind , and there huddled together for warmth , they enjoyed a few hours ' sleep . before daybreak , however , they were up and on their way once more . they had seen no signs of any pursuers , and jefferson hope began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose enmity they had incurred . he little knew how far that iron grasp could reach , or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them .",124
"he had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them . even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bounded it . they must , he reflected , be awaiting him anxiously , for he had been absent nearly five hours . in the gladness of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re - echo to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming . he paused and listened for an answer . none came save his own cry , which clattered up the dreary silent ravines , and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions . again he shouted , even louder than before , and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago . a vague , nameless dread came over him , and he hurried onwards frantically , dropping the precious food in his agitation .",23
"for five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he had already traversed on horseback . at night he flung himself down among the rocks , and snatched a few hours of sleep ; but before daybreak he was always well on his way . on the sixth day , he reached the eagle ca√±on , from which they had commenced their ill - fated flight . thence he could look down upon the home of the saints . worn and exhausted , he leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him . as he looked at it , he observed that there were flags in some of the principal streets , and other signs of festivity . he was still speculating as to what this might mean when he heard the clatter of horse 's hoofs , and saw a mounted man riding towards him . as he approached , he recognized him as a mormon named cowper , to whom he had rendered services at different times . he therefore accosted him when he got up to him , with the object of finding out what lucy ferrier 's fate had been .",72
"the prediction of the mormon was only too well fulfilled . whether it was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which she had been forced , poor lucy never held up her head again , but pined away and died within a month . her sottish husband , who had married her principally for the sake of john ferrier 's property , did not affect any great grief at his bereavement ; but his other wives mourned over her , and sat up with her the night before the burial , as is the mormon custom . they were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning , when , to their inexpressible fear and astonishment , the door was flung open , and a savage - looking , weather - beaten man in tattered garments strode into the room . without a glance or a word to the cowering women , he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of lucy ferrier . stooping over her , he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead , and then , snatching up her hand , he took the wedding - ring from her finger . "" she shall not be buried in that , "" he cried with a fierce snarl , and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone . so strange and so brief was the episode , that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it , had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared .",235
"i reentered my stateroom . from there i could hear movements inside captain nemo 's quarters . i could n't pass up this chance for an encounter . i knocked on his door . i received no reply . i knocked again , then tried the knob . the door opened .",8

"candide trembled like a philosopher , and concealed himself as well as he could during this heroic butchery .",13
the nearest point of the beach he could reach was thus fully that distance off .,7
"candide made all the haste he could to another village , which belonged to the bulgarians , and there he found the heroic abares had enacted the same tragedy .",6
"he admitted , however , although with hesitation , that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable origin ‚Äî to the severe and long - continued illness ‚Äî indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution ‚Äî of a tenderly beloved sister , his sole companion for long years , his last and only relative on earth .",19
"the castaways proceeded toward the north of the land on which chance had thrown them , an unknown region , the geographical situation of which they could not even guess .",26
"when a door , at length , closed upon her , my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother ; but he had buried his face in his hands , and i could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears .",35
"however , pencroft observed that the shore was more equal , that the ground rose , and he declared that it was joined by a long slope to a hill , whose massive front he thought that he could see looming indistinctly through the mist .",38
"but how could this beautiful cause produce in you so hideous an effect ? """,2
but the fervid facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for .,7
"however , pencroft , accustomed with his sailor eyes to piece through the gloom , was almost certain that he could clearly distinguish in the west confused masses which indicated an elevated coast .",20
"but they could not in the dark determine whether it was a single island , or connected with others .",2
"they did not even think of taking a minute 's rest . forgetting everything but their chief , hoping or wishing to hope on , they continued to walk up and down on this sterile spot , always returning to its northern point , where they could approach nearest to the scene of the catastrophe .",46
"the sailor nodded ; besides , his eyes could not deceive him .",8
"this person , taking him up with great complaisance , said , "" possibly , my good sir , you do not believe in original sin ; for , if everything is best , there could have been no such thing as the fall or punishment of man . """,35
"towards five o'clock in the morning of the 25th of march , the sky began to lighten ; the horizon still remained dark , but with daybreak a thick mist rose from the sea , so that the eye could scarcely penetrate beyond twenty feet or so from where they stood .",39
"it was unfortunate , however , that the castaways could distinguish nothing around them .",9
"after the earthquake , which had destroyed three - fourths of the city of lisbon , the sages of that country could think of no means more effectual to preserve the kingdom from utter ruin than to entertain the people with an auto - da - fe , it having been decided by the university of coimbra , that the burning of a few people alive by a slow fire , and with great ceremony , is an infallible preventive of earthquakes .",21
"both went into the bedroom , and as the door of communication remained open , d‚Äôartagnan could hear milady for some time scolding her maid . she was at length appeased , and the conversation turned upon him while kitty was assisting her mistress .",16
"his strength failed him , he could not utter a word , he fell at her feet . cunegund fainted upon the sofa .",6
"the old woman bedewed them with spirits ; they recovered - they began to speak . at first they could express themselves only in broken accents ; their questions and answers were alternately interrupted with sighs , tears , and exclamations .",19
his black shoulders could be seen emerging at each stroke .,3
"it must , however , be confessed in his justification that the first use he made of his influence over kitty was to try and find out what had become of mme . bonacieux ; but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to d‚Äôartagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head , her mistress never admitting her into half her secrets -- only she believed she could say she was not dead .",68
"they could easily distinguish a confused mass of great trees , which extended beyond the limits of their view .",1
"this jew showed me great kindness , in hopes of gaining my favors ; but he never could prevail on me to yield . a modest woman may be once ravished ; but her virtue is greatly strengthened thereby .",17
"i could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work , and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac , when , one evening , having informed me abruptly that the lady madeline was no more , he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight ( previously to its final interment ) , in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building .",1
i had hitherto believed that nothing could equal the beauty of the castle of thunder - ten - tronckh ; but i found i was mistaken .,6

"milady could not at all comprehend the silence of the comte de wardes , and she ordered kitty to come at nine o‚Äôclock in the morning to take a third letter .",1
"our glances , however , rested not long upon the dead ‚Äî for we could not regard her unawed .",14
"but how could you , who are of so mild a temper , despatch a jew and an inquisitor in two minutes ' time ? """,2
"besides , d‚Äôartagnan from her own admission knew milady culpable of treachery in matters more important , and could entertain no respect for her .",18
"d‚Äôartagnan ‚Äôs plan was very simple . by kitty ‚Äôs chamber he could gain that of her mistress . he would take advantage of the first moment of surprise , shame , and terror , to triumph over her . he might fail , but something must be left to chance .",12

"since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments , there had been no fixed meeting between them . they dined apart from one another , wherever they might happen to be , or rather where they could . duty likewise on its part took a portion of that precious time which was gliding away so rapidly -- only they had agreed to meet once a week , about one o‚Äôclock , at the residence of athos , seeing that he , in agreement with the vow he had formed , did not pass over the threshold of his door .",40

"here again i paused abruptly , and now with a feeling of wild amazement ‚Äî for there could be no doubt whatever that , in this instance , i did actually hear ( although from what direction it proceeded i found it impossible to say ) a low and apparently distant , but harsh , protracted , and most unusual screaming or grating sound ‚Äî the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon ‚Äôs unnatural shriek as described by the romancer .",17

"however , the sailor thought that by stopping - up some of the openings with a mixture of stones and sand , the chimneys could be rendered habitable .",24

"so she was considering in her own mind ( as well as she could , for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid ) , whether the pleasure of making a daisy - chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies , when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her .",13

"to the south a sharp point closed the horizon , and it could not be seen if the land was prolonged in that direction , or if it ran southeast and southwest , which would have made this coast a very long peninsula .",12
"after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance , and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming . it was the white rabbit returning , splendidly dressed , with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other : he came trotting along in a great hurry , muttering to himself as he came , ' oh ! the duchess , the duchess ! oh ! wo n't she be savage if i 've kept her waiting !

but this important question could not yet be answered .,4
"as she said this she looked down at her hands , and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbit 's little white kid gloves while she was talking . ' how can i have done that ?

"it was the first time that he had ever seen birds taken with a line , but the sailor modestly confessed that it was not his first attempt , and that besides he could not claim the merit of invention .",33
"' they could n't have done that , you know , ' alice gently remarked ; ' they 'd have been ill . '",2
""" i wish i could think like you , mr . spilett , "" replied pencroft ; "" unhappily , my mind is made up on this point . """,4
"upon their arrival at venice candide went in search of cacambo at every inn and coffee - house , and among all the ladies of pleasure , but could hear nothing of him . he sent every day to inquire what ships were in , still no news of cacambo .",28
"this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear : she got up in great disgust , and walked off ; the dormouse fell asleep instantly , and neither of the others took the least notice of her going , though she looked back once or twice , half hoping that they would call after her : the last time she saw them , they were trying to put the dormouse into the teapot .",8
"' i could n't help it , ' said five , in a sulky tone ; ' seven jogged my elbow . '",2
the reporter could not refrain from embracing the generous boy .,2
"alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners , but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions ; ' and besides , what would be the use of a procession , ' thought she , ' if people had all to lie down upon their faces , so that they could n't see it ? ' so she stood still where she was , and waited .",21

"' and who are these ? ' said the queen , pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree ; for , you see , as they were lying on their faces , and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack , she could not tell whether they were gardeners , or soldiers , or courtiers , or three of her own children .",53
"in an instant d‚Äôartagnan perceived that the best way in which he could act would be to go home and write milady a long letter , in which he would confess to her that he and de wardes were , up to the present moment absolutely the same , and that consequently he could not undertake , without committing suicide , to kill the comte de wardes .",12

"but he also was spurred on by a ferocious desire of vengeance . he wished to subdue this woman in his own name ; and as this vengeance appeared to him to have a certain sweetness in it , he could not make up his mind to renounce it .",40
"the sailor strained his ears , but could hear no noise beyond those caused by the storm .",7
"all this was of such incredible immodesty , of such monstrous effrontery , that d‚Äôartagnan could scarcely believe what he saw or what he heard .",15
"the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo : she succeeded in getting its body tucked away , comfortably enough , under her arm , with its legs hanging down , but generally , just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out , and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head , it would twist itself round and look up in her face , with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing : and when she had got its head down , and was going to begin again , it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself , and was in the act of crawling away : besides all this , there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to , and , as the doubled - up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground , alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed .",81
"she was looking about for some way of escape , and wondering whether she could get away without being seen , when she noticed a curious appearance in the air : it puzzled her very much at first , but , after watching it a minute or two , she made it out to be a grin , and she said to herself ' it 's the cheshire cat : now i shall have somebody to talk to . '",14
"then d‚Äôartagnan , who had never seriously thought of this impossible duel , endeavored to turn the conversation ; but he could not succeed .",21
it could only be top !,1
"the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog , which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other : the only difficulty was , that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden , where alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree .",48
"the sailor squeezed the reporter 's hand , for he could not make himself heard , in a way which signified "" wait ! "" then he reentered the passage .",10
"the executioner 's argument was , that you could n't cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from : that he had never had to do such a thing before , and he was n't going to begin at his time of life .",8
"the king 's argument was , that anything that had a head could be beheaded , and that you were n't to talk nonsense .",12
alice could think of nothing else to say but ' it belongs to the duchess : you 'd better ask her about it . ',1
"alice did not much like keeping so close to her : first , because the duchess was very ugly ; and secondly , because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon alice 's shoulder , and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin . however , she did not like to be rude , so she bore it as well as she could .",65
"the turn of the rocks sheltered them from the wind , and they could breathe after this walk or rather run of a quarter of an hour .",13
"they could now hear and reply to each other , and the lad having pronounced the name of cyrus harding , top gave a few short barks , as much as to say that his master was saved .",1
"' that 's nothing to what i could say if i chose , ' the duchess replied , in a pleased tone .",7
"upon this , turning about to see from whom these words came , he beheld cacambo . nothing but the sight of miss cunegund could have given him greater joy and surprise . he was almost beside himself , and embraced this dear friend .",24
"at the same time on the left the hilly parts of the coast could be seen , though very indistinctly .",13
"they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance , sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock , and , as they came nearer , alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break . she pitied him deeply . ' what is his sorrow ? ' she asked the gryphon , and the gryphon answered , very nearly in the same words as before , ' it 's all his fancy , that : he has n't got no sorrow , you know . come on ! '",34
"they resembled a switzerland modeled in sand , and only an amazing instinct could have possibly recognized the way .",13
"these words were followed by a very long silence , broken only by an occasional exclamation of ' hjckrrh ! ' from the gryphon , and the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle . alice was very nearly getting up and saying , ' thank you , sir , for your interesting story , ' but she could not help thinking there must be more to come , so she sat still and said nothing .",58
"' hold your tongue ! ' added the gryphon , before alice could speak again . the mock turtle went on .",12
"but how could she possibly have been reduced to so abject a condition , when i sent five or six millions to her by you ? """,2
"he could scarcely be recognized , exhausted with fatigue , broken with grief .",1
"' you could n't have wanted it much , ' said alice ; ' living at the bottom of the sea . '",2
' i could n't afford to learn it . ' said the mock turtle with a sigh . ' i only took the regular course . ',2
"then milady attempted to tear down the doorcase , with a strength apparently above that of a woman ; but finding she could not accomplish this , she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard , the point of which repeatedly glittered through the wood .",22
"when they had a little recovered themselves , i heard her say to her husband , ' my dear , how could you think of dissecting a heretic ? do n't you know that the devil is always in them ? i 'll run directly to a priest to come and drive the evil spirit out . '",21
could he not rely on the sagacity of the faithful animal ?,0
"d‚Äôartagnan donned the robe as quickly as he could , mistaking one sleeve for the other , so greatly was he still agitated .",8
""" i have always abided by my first opinion , "" answered pangloss ; "" for , after all , i am a philosopher , and it would not become me to retract my sentiments ; especially as leibnitz could not be in the wrong : and that preestablished harmony is the finest thing in the world , as well as a plenum and the materia subtilis . """,39
"the explanation of this fact could only be produced from the engineer 's own lips , and they must wait for that till speech returned .",5
"' but about his toes ? ' the mock turtle persisted . ' how could he turn them out with his nose , you know ? '",14
"meanwhile , the care which was lavished on the engineer brought him back to consciousness sooner than they could have expected .",18
"candide had , in truth , no great inclination to marry miss cunegund ; but the extreme impertinence of the baron determined him to conclude the match ; and cunegund pressed him so warmly , that he could not recant .",37
"on the way the sailor could not help repeating,--",5
"alice could see , as well as if she were looking over their shoulders , that all the jurors were writing down ' stupid things ! ' on their slates , and she could even make out that one of them did n't know how to spell ' stupid , ' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him . ' a nice muddle their slates'll be in before the trial 's over ! ' thought alice .",1

"one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked . this of course , alice could not stand , and she went round the court and got behind him , and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away . she did it so quickly that the poor little juror ( it was bill , the lizard ) could not make out at all what had become of it ; so , after hunting all about for it , he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day ; and this was of very little use , as it left no mark on the slate .",15

"arrived at the summit of the mound , pencroft and his two companions set to work , with no other tools than their hands , to despoil of its principal branches a rather sickly tree , a sort of marine fir ; with these branches they made a litter , on which , covered with grass and leaves , they could carry the engineer .",60
"there he was , in the midst of the angry sea , at a distance which could not be less than half a mile from the shore .",16
"from the corner of the divan of persian saddle - bags on which he was lying , smoking , as was his custom , innumerable cigarettes , lord henry wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey - sweet and honey- coloured blossoms of a laburnum , whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs ; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore - silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window , producing a kind of momentary japanese effect , and making him think of those pallid , jade - faced painters of tokio who , through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile , seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion .",30
"' --and just take his head off outside , ' the queen added to one of the officers : but the hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door .",29
"towards twelve o'clock , pencroft having asked the engineer if they could now remove him , harding , instead of replying , and by an effort which exhibited the most energetic will , got up .",11
"there was a distance of eight miles to be accomplished ; but , as they could not go fast , and it would perhaps be necessary to stop frequently , they reckoned that it would take at least six hours to reach the chimneys .",15
"' oh , i beg your pardon ! ' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay , and began picking them up again as quickly as she could , for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head , and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury - box , or they would die .",28
"some of the jury wrote it down ' important , ' and some ' unimportant . ' alice could see this , as she was near enough to look over their slates ; ' but it does n't matter a bit , ' she thought to herself .",18
"the wind shook some blossoms from the trees , and the heavy lilac - blooms , with their clustering stars , moved to and fro in the languid air . a grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall , and like a blue thread a long thin dragon - fly floated past on its brown gauze wings . lord henry felt as if he could hear basil hallward 's heart beating , and wondered what was coming .",64
