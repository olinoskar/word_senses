"i was left alone . but how was it possible for a man of my undecided turn of mind to argue successfully with so irascible a person as the professor ? with this persuasion i was hurrying away to my own little retreat upstairs , when the street door creaked upon its hinges ; heavy feet made the whole flight of stairs to shake ; and the master of the house , passing rapidly through the dining - room , threw himself in haste into his own sanctum . but on his rapid way he had found time to fling his hazel stick into a corner , his rough broadbrim upon the table , and these few emphatic words at his nephew :",42

"monsieur your friend ( pardon for not calling him by the honorable name which no doubt he bears , but we do not know that name ) , monsieur your friend , having disabled two men with his pistols , retreated fighting with his sword , with which he disabled one of my men , and stunned me with a blow of the flat side of it .

"the two castaways , john ferrier and the little girl who had shared his fortunes and had been adopted as his daughter , accompanied the mormons to the end of their great pilgrimage . little lucy ferrier was borne along pleasantly enough in elder stangerson 's waggon , a retreat which she shared with the mormon 's three wives and with his son , a headstrong forward boy of twelve . having rallied , with the elasticity of childhood , from the shock caused by her mother 's death , she soon became a pet with the women , and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving canvas - covered home . in the meantime ferrier having recovered from his privations , distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable hunter . so rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions , that when they reached the end of their wanderings , it was unanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers , with the exception of young himself , and of stangerson , kemball , johnston , and drebber , who were the four principal elders .",49

"meanwhile , crazed with terror , the unhinged papuans beat a retreat . as for us , half laughing , we massaged and comforted poor ned land , who was swearing like one possessed . but just then , lifted off by the tide 's final undulations , the nautilus left its coral bed at exactly that fortieth minute pinpointed by the captain . its propeller churned the waves with lazy majesty . gathering speed little by little , the ship navigated on the surface of the ocean , and safe and sound , it left behind the dangerous narrows of the torres strait .",11

"and if nothing happens without his knowledge , he knows that i am here , and am in this dreadful condition ; and if nothing happens without his appointment , he has appointed all this to befall me . nothing occurred to my thought to contradict any of these conclusions , and therefore it rested upon me with the greater force , that it must needs be that god had appointed all this to befall me ; that i was brought into this miserable circumstance by his direction , he having the sole power , not of me only , but of everything that happened in the world . immediately it followed : why has god done this to me ? what have i done to be thus used ? my conscience presently checked me in that inquiry , as if i had blasphemed , and methought it spoke to me like a voice : “ wretch ! dost _ thou _ ask what thou hast done ? look back upon a dreadful misspent life , and ask thyself what thou hast _ not _ done ? ask , why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed ? why wert thou not drowned in yarmouth roads ; killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the sallee man - of - war ; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of africa ; or drowned _ here _ , when all the crew perished but thyself ? dost _ thou _ ask , what have i done ? ” i was struck dumb with these reflections , as one astonished , and had not a word to say — no , not to answer to myself , but rose up pensive and sad , walked back to my retreat , and went up over my wall , as if i had been going to bed ; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed , and i had no inclination to sleep ; so i sat down in my chair , and lighted my lamp , for it began to be dark . now , as the apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me very much , it occurred to my thought that the brazilians take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers , and i had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests , which was quite cured , and some also that was green , and not quite cured .",303
