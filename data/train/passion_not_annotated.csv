"he and miss wilson took the liberty of falling in love with each other -- at least tedo and i thought so ; we surprised sundry tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of ' la belle passion , ' and i promise you the public soon had the benefit of our discovery ; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our dead - weights from the house .",39
""" sir , "" i said , "" you 're surely unaware of the discussions that have taken place in europe and america with yourself as the subject . you do n't realize that various accidents , caused by collisions with your underwater machine , have aroused public passions on those two continents . i 'll spare you the innumerable hypotheses with which we 've tried to explain this inexplicable phenomenon , whose secret is yours alone . but please understand that the abraham lincoln chased you over the pacific high seas in the belief it was hunting some powerful marine monster , which had to be purged from the ocean at all cost .

"the pilot went on board at six , and took his place on the bridge , to guide the rangoon through the channels to the port of hong kong . passepartout longed to ask him if the steamer had left for yokohama ; but he dared not , for he wished to preserve the spark of hope , which still remained till the last moment . he had confided his anxiety to fix who -- the sly rascal!--tried to console him by saying that mr . fogg would be in time if he took the next boat ; but this only put passepartout in a passion .",105
"this woman exercised over him an unaccountable power ; he hated and adored her at the same time . he would not have believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart , and by their union constitute a passion so strange , and as it were , diabolical . presently it sounded one oâ€™clock .",42
"athos then shrugged his shoulders , and , without putting himself in a passion , thrashed grimaud .",13
"this was the last straw , and it resulted in arousing public passions all over again . indeed , from this moment on , any maritime casualty without an established cause was charged to the monster 's account . this outrageous animal had to shoulder responsibility for all derelict vessels , whose numbers are unfortunately considerable , since out of those 3,000 ships whose losses are recorded annually at the marine insurance bureau , the figure for steam or sailing ships supposedly lost with all hands , in the absence of any news , amounts to at least 200 !",12
"yet it was watching him , with its beautiful marred face and its cruel smile . its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight . its blue eyes met his own . a sense of infinite pity , not for himself , but for the painted image of himself , came over him . it had altered already , and would alter more . its gold would wither into grey . its red and white roses would die . for every sin that he committed , a stain would fleck and wreck its fairness . but he would not sin . the picture , changed or unchanged , would be to him the visible emblem of conscience . he would resist temptation . he would not see lord henry any more -- would not , at any rate , listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in basil hallward 's garden had first stirred within him the passion for impossible things . he would go back to sibyl vane , make her amends , marry her , try to love her again . yes , it was his duty to do so . she must have suffered more than he had . poor child ! he had been selfish and cruel to her . the fascination that she had exercised over him would return . they would be happy together . his life with her would be beautiful and pure .",157

"yes ; the future bridegroom , mr . rochester himself , exercised over his intended a ceaseless surveillance ; and it was from this sagacity -- this guardedness of his -- this perfect , clear consciousness of his fair one 's defects -- this obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her , that my ever- torturing pain arose .",47
"the officer leaned forward , looked at her in his turn , and appeared surprised to see that face , just before so beautiful , distorted with passion and almost hideous .",27

""" very good , barrymore . we may talk further of this some other time . "" when the butler had gone i walked over to the black window , and i looked through a blurred pane at the driving clouds and at the tossing outline of the wind - swept trees . it is a wild night indoors , and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor . what passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk in such a place at such a time ! and what deep and earnest purpose can he have which calls for such a trial ! there , in that hut upon the moor , seems to lie the very centre of that problem which has vexed me so sorely . i swear that another day shall not have passed before i have done all that man can do to reach the heart of the mystery .",74
"he shuddered , and for a moment he regretted that he had not told basil the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away . basil would have helped him to resist lord henry 's influence , and the still more poisonous influences that came from his own temperament . the love that he bore him -- for it was really love-- had nothing in it that was not noble and intellectual . it was not that mere physical admiration of beauty that is born of the senses and that dies when the senses tire . it was such love as michelangelo had known , and montaigne , and winckelmann , and shakespeare himself . yes , basil could have saved him . but it was too late now . the past could always be annihilated . regret , denial , or forgetfulness could do that . but the future was inevitable . there were passions in him that would find their terrible outlet , dreams that would make the shadow of their evil real .",158

"distracted between these two passions he took his gold and his diamonds , and procured a person to conduct him and martin to the house where miss cunegund lodged . upon entering the room he felt his limbs tremble , his heart flutter , his tongue falter ; he attempted to undraw the curtain , and called for a light to the bedside .",4
wild was the wrestle which should be paramount ; but another feeling rose and triumphed : something hard and cynical : self - willed and resolute : it settled his passion and petrified his countenance : he went on--,30
"st . john , no doubt , would have given the world to follow , recall , retain her , when she thus left him ; but he would not give one chance of heaven , nor relinquish , for the elysium of her love , one hope of the true , eternal paradise . besides , he could not bind all that he had in his nature -- the rover , the aspirant , the poet , the priest -- in the limits of a single passion .",87
""" yes , you are the same . i wonder what the rest of your life will be . do n't spoil it by renunciations . at present you are a perfect type . do n't make yourself incomplete . you are quite flawless now . you need not shake your head : you know you are . besides , dorian , do n't deceive yourself . life is not governed by will or intention . life is a question of nerves , and fibres , and slowly built - up cells in which thought hides itself and passion has its dreams . you may fancy yourself safe and think yourself strong . but a chance tone of colour in a room or a morning sky , a particular perfume that you had once loved and that brings subtle memories with it , a line from a forgotten poem that you had come across again , a cadence from a piece of music that you had ceased to play-- i tell you , dorian , that it is on things like these that our lives depend . browning writes about that somewhere ; but our own senses will imagine them for us .",98
"again he turned lividly pale ; but , as before , controlled his passion perfectly . he answered emphatically but calmly--",13
"the young man was leaning against the mantelshelf , watching him with that strange expression that one sees on the faces of those who are absorbed in a play when some great artist is acting . there was neither real sorrow in it nor real joy . there was simply the passion of the spectator , with perhaps a flicker of triumph in his eyes . he had taken the flower out of his coat , and was smelling it , or pretending to do so .",51
