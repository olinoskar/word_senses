"barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against the glass . his profile was half turned towards me , and his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the moor . for some minutes he stood watching intently . then he gave a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light . instantly i made my way back to my room , and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing once more upon their return journey . long afterwards when i had fallen into a light sleep i heard a key turn somewhere in a lock , but i could not tell whence the sound came . what it all means i can not guess , but there is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of . i do not trouble you with my theories , for you asked me to furnish you only with facts . i have had a long talk with sir henry this morning , and we have made a plan of campaign founded upon my observations of last night . i will not speak about it just now , but it should make my next report interesting reading .",174
"in an hour we had reached the islet . two hours later we had completed a full circle around it . it measured four to five miles in circumference . a narrow channel separated it from a considerable shore , perhaps a continent whose limits we could n't see . the existence of this shore seemed to bear out commander maury 's hypotheses . in essence , this ingenious american has noted that between the south pole and the 60th parallel , the sea is covered with floating ice of dimensions much greater than any found in the north atlantic . from this fact he drew the conclusion that the antarctic circle must contain considerable shores , since icebergs ca n't form on the high seas but only along coastlines . according to his calculations , this frozen mass enclosing the southernmost pole forms a vast ice cap whose width must reach 4,000 kilometers .",103

"in fact , the mystery of that last afternoon when we were locked in prison and put to sleep , the captain 's violent precaution of snatching from my grasp a spyglass poised to scour the horizon , and the fatal wound given that man during some unexplained collision suffered by the nautilus , all led me down a plain trail . no ! captain nemo was n't content simply to avoid humanity ! his fearsome submersible served not only his quest for freedom , but also , perhaps , it was used in lord - knows - what schemes of dreadful revenge .",1

"this momentous conversation ended in a few minutes with warm acknowledgments paid by the german to the icelandic professor . at this dinner my uncle had just elicited important facts , amongst others , the history of saknussemm , the reason of the mysterious document , that his host would not accompany him in his expedition , and that the very next day a guide would be waiting upon him .",29

"lord henry shrugged his shoulders . "" my dear fellow , mediaeval art is charming , but mediaeval emotions are out of date . one can use them in fiction , of course . but then the only things that one can use in fiction are the things that one has ceased to use in fact . believe me , no civilized man ever regrets a pleasure , and no uncivilized man ever knows what a pleasure is .
