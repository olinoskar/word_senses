"suddenly she came upon a little three - legged table , all made of solid glass ; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key , and alice 's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall ; but , alas ! either the locks were too large , or the key was too small , but at any rate it would not open any of them . however , on the second time round , she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before , and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high : she tried the little golden key in the lock , and to her great delight it fitted !",92,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"it was all very well to say ' drink me , ' but the wise little alice was not going to do that in a hurry . ' no , i 'll look first , ' she said , ' and see whether it 's marked "" poison "" or not ' ; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt , and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things , all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them : such as , that a red - hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long ; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife , it usually bleeds ; and she had never forgotten that , if you drink much from a bottle marked ' poison , ' it is almost certain to disagree with you , sooner or later .",64,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"after a while , finding that nothing more happened , she decided on going into the garden at once ; but , alas for poor alice ! when she got to the door , she found she had forgotten the little golden key , and when she went back to the table for it , she found she could not possibly reach it : she could see it quite plainly through the glass , and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table , but it was too slippery ; and when she had tired herself out with trying , the poor little thing sat down and cried .",37,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"as she said this she looked down at her hands , and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbit 's little white kid gloves while she was talking . ' how can i have done that ? ' she thought . ' i must be growing small again . ' she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it , and found that , as nearly as she could guess , she was now about two feet high , and was going on shrinking rapidly : she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding , and she dropped it hastily , just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether .",18,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"as she said these words her foot slipped , and in another moment , splash ! she was up to her chin in salt water . her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea , ' and in that case i can go back by railway , ' she said to herself . ( alice had been to the seaside once in her life , and had come to the general conclusion , that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea , some children digging in the sand with wooden spades , then a row of lodging houses , and behind them a railway station . ) however , she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high .",59,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off , and she swam nearer to make out what it was : at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus , but then she remembered how small she was now , and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself .",60,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"it was high time to go , for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it : there were a duck and a dodo , a lory and an eaglet , and several other curious creatures . alice led the way , and the whole party swam to the shore .",20,"('have', 'être', 'haber')",1
"' what is a caucus - race ? ' said alice ; not that she wanted much to know , but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak , and no one else seemed inclined to say anything .",23,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"alice had no idea what to do , and in despair she put her hand in her pocket , and pulled out a box of comfits , ( luckily the salt water had not got into it ) , and handed them round as prizes . there was exactly one a - piece all round . ' but she must have a prize herself , you know , ' said the mouse .",32,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window , and on it ( as she had hoped ) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves : she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves , and was just going to leave the room , when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking- glass . there was no label this time with the words ' drink me , ' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips . ' i know something interesting is sure to happen , ' she said to herself , ' whenever i eat or drink anything ; so i 'll just see what this bottle does . i do hope it 'll make me grow large again , for really i 'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing !

"luckily for alice , the little magic bottle had now had its full effect , and she grew no larger : still it was very uncomfortable , and , as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again , no wonder she felt unhappy .",8,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"the great question certainly was , what ? alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass , but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances . there was a large mushroom growing near her , about the same height as herself ; and when she had looked under it , and on both sides of it , and behind it , it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it .",61,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation . alice replied , rather shyly , ' i -- i hardly know , sir , just at present-- at least i know who i was when i got up this morning , but i think i must have been changed several times since then . '",47,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"' of the mushroom , ' said the caterpillar , just as if she had asked it aloud ; and in another moment it was out of sight .",14,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"' as if it was n't trouble enough hatching the eggs , ' said the pigeon ; ' but i must be on the look - out for serpents night and day ! why , i have n't had a wink of sleep these three weeks ! '",36,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"' i -- i'm a little girl , ' said alice , rather doubtfully , as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day .",23,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"' a likely story indeed ! ' said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt . ' i 've seen a good many little girls in my time , but never one with such a neck as that ! no , no ! you 're a serpent ; and there 's no use denying it . i suppose you 'll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg ! '",20,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"' i have tasted eggs , certainly , ' said alice , who was a very truthful child ; ' but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do , you know . '",2,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"so she set the little creature down , and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood . ' if it had grown up , ' she said to herself , ' it would have made a dreadfully ugly child : but it makes rather a handsome pig , i think . ' and she began thinking over other children she knew , who might do very well as pigs , and was just saying to herself , ' if one only knew the right way to change them-- ' when she was a little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off .",25,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"' i should like it very much , ' said alice , ' but i have n't been invited yet . '",15,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"' it turned into a pig , ' alice quietly said , just as if it had come back in a natural way .",16,"('have', 'être', 'haber')",1
"' all right , ' said the cat ; and this time it vanished quite slowly , beginning with the end of the tail , and ending with the grin , which remained some time after the rest of it had gone .",40,"('have', 'être', 'haber')",1
"' well ! i 've often seen a cat without a grin , ' thought alice ; ' but a grin without a cat ! it 's the most curious thing i ever saw in my life ! '",4,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"' your hair wants cutting , ' said the hatter . he had been looking at alice for some time with great curiosity , and this was his first speech .",12,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"the hatter was the first to break the silence . ' what day of the month is it ? ' he said , turning to alice : he had taken his watch out of his pocket , and was looking at it uneasily , shaking it every now and then , and holding it to his ear .",28,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity . ' what a funny watch ! ' she remarked . ' it tells the day of the month , and does n't tell what o'clock it is ! '",1,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"once more she found herself in the long hall , and close to the little glass table . ' now , i 'll manage better this time , ' she said to herself , and began by taking the little golden key , and unlocking the door that led into the garden . then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom ( she had kept a piece of it in her pocket ) till she was about a foot high : then she walked down the little passage : and then -- she found herself at last in the beautiful garden , among the bright flower - beds and the cool fountains .",64,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
' what for ? ' said the one who had spoken first .,9,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"five and seven said nothing , but looked at two . two began in a low voice , ' why the fact is , you see , miss , this here ought to have been a red rose - tree , and we put a white one in by mistake ; and if the queen was to find it out , we should all have our heads cut off , you know . so you see , miss , we 're doing our best , afore she comes , to-- ' at this moment five , who had been anxiously looking across the garden , called out ' the queen ! the queen ! ' and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces . there was a sound of many footsteps , and alice looked round , eager to see the queen .",97,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"alice began to feel very uneasy : to be sure , she had not as yet had any dispute with the queen , but she knew that it might happen any minute , ' and then , ' thought she , ' what would become of me ? they 're dreadfully fond of beheading people here ; the great wonder is , that there 's any one left alive ! '",12,"('have', 'être', 'haber')",1
"by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back , the fight was over , and both the hedgehogs were out of sight : ' but it does n't matter much , ' thought alice , ' as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground .

"the executioner 's argument was , that you could n't cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from : that he had never had to do such a thing before , and he was n't going to begin at his time of life .",27,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"the cat 's head began fading away the moment he was gone , and , by the time he had come back with the duchess , it had entirely disappeared ; so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it , while the rest of the party went back to the game .",27,"('have', 'avoir', 'haber')",0
"she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time , and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear .

"as they walked off together , alice heard the king say in a low voice , to the company generally , ' you are all pardoned . ' ' come , that 's a good thing !

"one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked . this of course , alice could not stand , and she went round the court and got behind him , and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away . she did it so quickly that the poor little juror ( it was bill , the lizard ) could not make out at all what had become of it ; so , after hunting all about for it , he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day ; and this was of very little use , as it left no mark on the slate .",66,"('have', 'être', 'haber')",1
