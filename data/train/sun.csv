"for ned land , as well as for every navigator before us , i knew that this was the great insurmountable obstacle . when the sun appeared for an instant near noon , captain nemo took a reasonably accurate sight that gave our position as longitude 51 degrees 30 ' and latitude 67 degrees 39 ' south . this was a position already well along in these antarctic regions .",25,"('sun', 'soleil', 'sol')",0
"himself has hitherto sufficed to the toil , and the toil draws near its close : his glorious sun hastens to its setting .",18,"('sun', 'soleil', 'sol')",0
"i had a great high shapeless cap , made of a goat ’s skin , with a flap hanging down behind , as well to keep the sun from me as to shoot the rain off from running into my neck , nothing being so hurtful in these climates as the rain upon the flesh under the clothes .",27,"('sun', 'soleil', 'sol')",0
"we were walking on sand that was fine - grained and smooth , not wrinkled like beach sand , which preserves the impressions left by the waves . this dazzling carpet was a real mirror , throwing back the sun 's rays with startling intensity . the outcome : an immense vista of reflections that penetrated every liquid molecule . will anyone believe me if i assert that at this thirty - foot depth , i could see as if it was broad daylight ?",39,"('sun', 'rayon', 'rayo')",1
"beyond the reef , the sea sparkled beneath the sun 's rays .",9,"('sun', 'rayon', 'rayo')",1
"we had been gone from the nautilus for about an hour and a half . it was almost noon . i spotted this fact in the perpendicularity of the sun 's rays , which were no longer refracted . the magic of these solar colors disappeared little by little , with emerald and sapphire shades vanishing from our surroundings altogether . we walked with steady steps that rang on the seafloor with astonishing intensity . the tiniest sounds were transmitted with a speed to which the ear is unaccustomed on shore . in fact , water is a better conductor of sound than air , and under the waves noises carry four times as fast .",29,"('sun', 'rayon', 'rayo')",1
"arriving at this 300-foot depth , i still detected the sun 's rays , but just barely . their intense brilliance had been followed by a reddish twilight , a midpoint between day and night . but we could see well enough to find our way , and it still was n't necessary to activate the ruhmkorff device .",10,"('sun', 'rayon', 'rayo')",1
"as to the points of the compass , the engineer had roughly fixed them by the height and position of the sun , which placed union bay and prospect heights to the east .",21,"('sun', 'soleil', 'sol')",0
"but the next day , by taking the exact hour of the rising and setting of the sun , and by marking its position between this rising and setting , he reckoned to fix the north of the island exactly , for , in consequence of its situation in the southern hemisphere , the sun , at the precise moment of its culmination , passed in the north and not in the south , as , in its apparent movement , it seems to do , to those places situated in the northern hemisphere .",17,"('sun', 'soleil', 'sol')",0

"how long i was sunk in this torpor i can not estimate ; but when i awoke , it seemed as if the sun were settling toward the horizon . captain nemo was already up , and i had started to stretch my limbs , when an unexpected apparition brought me sharply to my feet .",23,"('sun', 'soleil', 'sol')",0
"after we had dined , or rather supped , i ordered friday to take one of the canoes , and go and fetch our muskets and other firearms , which , for want of time , we had left upon the place of battle ; and the next day i ordered him to go and bury the dead bodies of the savages , which lay open to the sun , and would presently be offensive . i also ordered him to bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast , which i could not think of doing myself ; nay , i could not bear to see them if i went that way ; all which he punctually performed , and effaced the very appearance of the savages being there ; so that when i went again , i could scarce know where it was , otherwise than by the corner of the wood pointing to the place .",68,"('sun', 'soleil', 'sol')",0
"an excellent breakfast was provided in vessels of gold ; and while the paraguayans were eating coarse indian corn out of wooden dishes in the open air , and exposed to the burning heat of the sun , the reverend father commandant retired to his cool arbor .",36,"('sun', 'soleil', 'sol')",0

""" see ! "" he went on . "" it 's waking up under the sun 's caresses ! it 's going to relive its daily existence ! what a fascinating field of study lies in watching the play of its organism . it owns a pulse and arteries , it has spasms , and i side with the scholarly commander maury , who discovered that it has a circulation as real as the circulation of blood in animals .

"the next day , june 1 , the nautilus kept to the same tack . it was obviously trying to locate some precise spot in the ocean . just as on the day before , captain nemo came to take the altitude of the sun . the sea was smooth , the skies clear . eight miles to the east , a big steamship was visible on the horizon line . no flag was flapping from the gaff of its fore - and - aft sail , and i could n't tell its nationality .",44,"('sun', 'soleil', 'sol')",0
"a few minutes before the sun passed its zenith , captain nemo raised his sextant and took his sights with the utmost precision . the absolute calm of the waves facilitated this operation . the nautilus lay motionless , neither rolling nor pitching .",5,"('sun', 'soleil', 'sol')",0
"that day , january 21 , 1868 , the chief officer went at noon to take the sun 's altitude . i climbed onto the platform , lit a cigar , and watched him at work . it seemed obvious to me that this man did n't understand french , because i made several remarks in a loud voice that were bound to provoke him to some involuntary show of interest had he understood them ; but he remained mute and emotionless .",17,"('sun', 'soleil', 'sol')",0
"meanwhile the mists did n't clear , and by eleven o'clock the sun still had n't made an appearance . its absence disturbed me . without it , no sights were possible . then how could we tell whether we had reached the pole ?",12,"('sun', 'soleil', 'sol')",0

"when i rejoined captain nemo , i found him leaning silently against a piece of rock and staring at the sky . he seemed impatient , baffled . but what could we do ? this daring and powerful man could n't control the sun as he did the sea .",43,"('sun', 'soleil', 'sol')",0
"the blizzard lasted until the next day . it was impossible to stay on the platform . from the lounge , where i was writing up the incidents of this excursion to the polar continent , i could hear the calls of petrel and albatross cavorting in the midst of the turmoil . the nautilus did n't stay idle , and cruising along the coast , it advanced some ten miles farther south amid the half light left by the sun as it skimmed the edge of the horizon .",80,"('sun', 'soleil', 'sol')",0
