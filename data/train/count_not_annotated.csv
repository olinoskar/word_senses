this name was magic ! it was the name of those islets where vessels under the count de la pérouse had miscarried . i straightened suddenly .,16
"since ayrton 's disappearance they were only four against five , for herbert could not yet be counted , and this was not the least care of the brave boy , who well understood the trouble of which he was the cause .",17

just then captain nemo asked me what i knew about the shipwreck of the count de la pérouse .,14
""" yes , count , "" said milady , in her softest voice , and pressing his hand in her own , "" i am happy in the love which your looks and your words have expressed to me every time we have met .",3

"in essence , it was precisely march 20 . tomorrow , the 21st , was the day of the equinox ; the sun would disappear below the horizon for six months not counting refraction , and after its disappearance the long polar night would begin . following the september equinox , the sun had emerged above the northerly horizon , rising in long spirals until december 21 . at that time , the summer solstice of these southernmost districts , the sun had started back down , and tomorrow it would cast its last rays .",32

"on the 23rd , several officers circled the island and brought back some rubble of little importance . the natives , adopting a system of denial and evasion , refused to guide them to the site of the casualty . this rather shady conduct aroused the suspicion that the natives had mistreated the castaways ; and in truth , the natives seemed afraid that dumont d'urville had come to avenge the count de la pérouse and his unfortunate companions .",71
"questioning the natives , captain dumont d'urville also learned that after la pérouse 's two ships had miscarried on the island 's reefs , the count had built a smaller craft , only to go off and miscarry a second time . where ? nobody knew .",25
"as for captain nemo , i wondered what he would make of our escaping , what concern or perhaps what distress it might cause him , and what he would do in the twofold event of our attempt either failing or being found out ! certainly i had no complaints to register with him , on the contrary . never was hospitality more wholehearted than his . yet in leaving him i could n't be accused of ingratitude . no solemn promises bound us to him . in order to keep us captive , he had counted only on the force of circumstances and not on our word of honor . but his avowed intention to imprison us forever on his ship justified our every effort .",96
"meanwhile , fearing that dumont d'urville was n't abreast of dillon 's activities , the french government sent a sloop of war to vanikoro , the bayonnaise under commander legoarant de tromelin , who had been stationed on the american west coast . dropping anchor before vanikoro a few months after the new astrolabe 's departure , the bayonnaise did n't find any additional evidence but verified that the savages had n't disturbed the memorial honoring the count de la pérouse .",77

""" now , allow me to finish what i have to tell you . i 've heard of you , professor aronnax . you , if not your companions , wo n't perhaps complain too much about the stroke of fate that has brought us together . among the books that make up my favorite reading , you 'll find the work you 've published on the great ocean depths . i 've pored over it . you 've taken your studies as far as terrestrial science can go . but you do n't know everything because you have n't seen everything . let me tell you , professor , you wo n't regret the time you spend aboard my vessel . you 're going to voyage through a land of wonders . stunned amazement will probably be your habitual state of mind . it will be a long while before you tire of the sights constantly before your eyes . i 'm going to make another underwater tour of the world-- perhaps my last , who knows?--and i 'll review everything i 've studied in the depths of these seas that i 've crossed so often , and you can be my fellow student . starting this very day , you 'll enter a new element , you 'll see what no human being has ever seen before-- since my men and i no longer count -- and thanks to me , you 're going to learn the ultimate secrets of our planet .

"i ca n't deny it ; the commander 's words had a tremendous effect on me . he had caught me on my weak side , and i momentarily forgot that not even this sublime experience was worth the loss of my freedom . besides , i counted on the future to resolve this important question . so i was content to reply :",47

"however , pencroft had thought of doing so , but cyrus harding having told him that even if he managed to count three hundred grains a minute , or nine thousand an hour , it would take him nearly five thousand five - hundred years to finish his task , the honest sailor considered it best to give up the idea .",21

"passepartout was crushed ; it overwhelmed him to lose the boat by three - quarters of an hour . it was his fault , for , instead of helping his master , he had not ceased putting obstacles in his path ! and when he recalled all the incidents of the tour , when he counted up the sums expended in pure loss and on his own account , when he thought that the immense stake , added to the heavy charges of this useless journey , would completely ruin mr . fogg , he overwhelmed himself with bitter self - accusations . mr . fogg , however , did not reproach him ; and , on leaving the cunard pier , only said : "" we will consult about what is best to - morrow . come .

"passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie . up to his arrival at bombay , he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there ; but , now that they were plainly whirling across india at full speed , a sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams . his old vagabond nature returned to him ; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took possession of him . he came to regard his master 's project as intended in good earnest , believed in the reality of the bet , and therefore in the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail within the designated period . already he began to worry about possible delays , and accidents which might happen on the way . he recognised himself as being personally interested in the wager , and trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable folly of the night before . being much less cool - headed than mr . fogg , he was much more restless , counting and recounting the days passed over , uttering maledictions when the train stopped , and accusing it of sluggishness , and mentally blaming mr . fogg for not having bribed the engineer . the worthy fellow was ignorant that , while it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer , it could not be done on the railway .",186

"in the midst of the watery mass , brightly lit by our electric beams , there snaked past those one - meter lampreys that are common to nearly every clime . a type of ray from the genus oxyrhynchus , five feet wide , had a white belly with a spotted , ash - gray back and was carried along by the currents like a huge , wide - open shawl . other rays passed by so quickly i could n't tell if they deserved that name "" eagle ray "" coined by the ancient greeks , or those designations of "" rat ray , "" "" bat ray , "" and "" toad ray "" that modern fishermen have inflicted on them . dogfish known as topes , twelve feet long and especially feared by divers , were racing with each other . looking like big bluish shadows , thresher sharks went by , eight feet long and gifted with an extremely acute sense of smell . dorados from the genus sparus , some measuring up to thirteen decimeters , appeared in silver and azure costumes encircled with ribbons , which contrasted with the dark color of their fins ; fish sacred to the goddess venus , their eyes set in brows of gold ; a valuable species that patronizes all waters fresh or salt , equally at home in rivers , lakes , and oceans , living in every clime , tolerating any temperature , their line dating back to prehistoric times on this earth yet preserving all its beauty from those far - off days . magnificent sturgeons , nine to ten meters long and extremely fast , banged their powerful tails against the glass of our panels , showing bluish backs with small brown spots ; they resemble sharks , without equaling their strength , and are encountered in every sea ; in the spring they delight in swimming up the great rivers , fighting the currents of the volga , danube , po , rhine , loire , and oder , while feeding on herring , mackerel , salmon , and codfish ; although they belong to the class of cartilaginous fish , they rate as a delicacy ; they 're eaten fresh , dried , marinated , or salt - preserved , and in olden times they were borne in triumph to the table of the roman epicure lucullus . but whenever the nautilus drew near the surface , those denizens of the mediterranean i could observe most productively belonged to the sixty - third genus of bony fish . these were tuna from the genus scomber , blue - black on top , silver on the belly armor , their dorsal stripes giving off a golden gleam . they are said to follow ships in search of refreshing shade from the hot tropical sun , and they did just that with the nautilus , as they had once done with the vessels of the count de la pérouse . for long hours they competed in speed with our submersible . i could n't stop marveling at these animals so perfectly cut out for racing , their heads small , their bodies sleek , spindle - shaped , and in some cases over three meters long , their pectoral fins gifted with remarkable strength , their caudal fins forked . like certain flocks of birds , whose speed they equal , these tuna swim in triangle formation , which prompted the ancients to say they 'd boned up on geometry and military strategy . and yet they ca n't escape the provençal fishermen , who prize them as highly as did the ancient inhabitants of turkey and italy ; and these valuable animals , as oblivious as if they were deaf and blind , leap right into the marseilles tuna nets and perish by the thousands .",501
