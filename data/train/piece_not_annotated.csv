"from the 14th of august to the 26th , incessant rain , so that i could not stir , and was now very careful not to be much wet . in this confinement , i began to be straitened for food : but venturing out twice , i one day killed a goat ; and the last day , which was the 26th , found a very large tortoise , which was a treat to me , and my food was regulated thus : i ate a bunch of raisins for my breakfast ; a piece of the goat ’s flesh , or of the turtle , for my dinner , broiled — for , to my great misfortune , i had no vessel to boil or stew anything ; and two or three of the turtle ’s eggs for my supper .",95

"other instruments , of course roughly fashioned , were also manufactured ; blades for planes , axes , hatchets , pieces of steel to be transformed into saws , chisels ; then iron for spades , pickaxes , hammers , nails , etc . at last , on the 5th of may , the metallic period ended , the smiths returned to the chimneys , and new work would soon authorize them to take a fresh title .",20
""" it is a very strange piece of business , "" i added ; "" i must know more about it . """,6
"near this dwelling of mine , but a little farther within the land , and upon lower ground , lay my two pieces of corn land , which i kept duly cultivated and sowed , and which duly yielded me their harvest in its season ; and whenever i had occasion for more corn , i had more land adjoining as fit as that .",22

"it was a magnificent sea otter from the genus enhydra , the only exclusively marine quadruped . one and a half meters long , this otter had to be worth a good high price . its coat , chestnut brown above and silver below , would have made one of those wonderful fur pieces so much in demand in the russian and chinese markets ; the fineness and luster of its pelt guaranteed that it would go for at least 2,000 francs . i was full of wonderment at this unusual mammal , with its circular head adorned by short ears , its round eyes , its white whiskers like those on a cat , its webbed and clawed feet , its bushy tail . hunted and trapped by fishermen , this valuable carnivore has become extremely rare , and it takes refuge chiefly in the northernmost parts of the pacific , where in all likelihood its species will soon be facing extinction .",53

"we did so , and it was well we did ; for never was a more furious charge than the creatures made upon us in this place . they came on with a growling kind of noise , and mounted the piece of timber , which , as i said , was our breastwork , as if they were only rushing upon their prey ; and this fury of theirs , it seems , was principally occasioned by their seeing our horses behind us . i ordered our men to fire as before , every other man ; and they took their aim so sure that they killed several of the wolves at the first volley ; but there was a necessity to keep a continual firing , for they came on like devils , those behind pushing on those before .",41
"alice had no idea what to do , and in despair she put her hand in her pocket , and pulled out a box of comfits , ( luckily the salt water had not got into it ) , and handed them round as prizes . there was exactly one a - piece all round .

"all the passengers had got out of the train , the wheels of which were stained with blood . from the tyres and spokes hung ragged pieces of flesh . as far as the eye could reach on the white plain behind , red trails were visible . the last sioux were disappearing in the south , along the banks of republican river .",26
"while cruising along only a few cable lengths from the underpinning of reao island , i marveled at the gigantic piece of work accomplished by these microscopic laborers . these walls were the express achievements of madrepores known by the names fire coral , finger coral , star coral , and stony coral . these polyps grow exclusively in the agitated strata at the surface of the sea , and so it 's in the upper reaches that they begin these substructures , which sink little by little together with the secreted rubble binding them . this , at least , is the theory of mr . charles darwin , who thus explains the formation of atolls -- a theory superior , in my view , to the one that says these madreporic edifices sit on the summits of mountains or volcanoes submerged a few feet below sea level .",20
