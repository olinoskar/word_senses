"several pigs , agoutis , kangaroos , and other rodents were seen , also two or three koalas , at which pencroft longed to have a shot .",13
"in all probability , and such was also herbert 's opinion , some had been left by formidable wild beasts which doubtless would give them some trouble ; but nowhere did they observe the mark of an axe on the trees , nor the ashes of a fire , nor the impression of a human foot . on this they might probably congratulate themselves , for on any land in the middle of the pacific the presence of man was perhaps more to be feared than desired .",7
"gideon spilett , who accompanied him , also heard these distant mutterings , which indicated a revivification of the subterranean fires .",7
"besides that , the fishing , either in the lake or the mercy , was very profitable , for pencroft had made some lines , armed with iron hooks , with which they frequently caught fine trout , and a species of fish whose silvery sides were speckled with yellow , and which were also extremely savory .",54

"as may be seen , the sailor 's confidence in the tutelary deity of his island was absolute , and , certainly , the occult power , manifested until now in so many inexplicable ways , appeared to be unlimited ; but also it knew how to escape the colonists ' most minute researches , for , in spite of all their efforts , in spite of the more than zeal,--the obstinacy,--with which they carried on their exploration , the retreat of the mysterious being could not be discovered .",42

"then the nautilus drew near the beaches of africa , where the sea is considerably deeper . there , through the open panels and in a midwater of crystal clarity , our ship enabled us to study wonderful bushes of shining coral and huge chunks of rock wrapped in splendid green furs of algae and fucus . what an indescribable sight , and what a variety of settings and scenery where these reefs and volcanic islands leveled off by the libyan coast ! but soon the nautilus hugged the eastern shore where these tree forms appeared in all their glory . this was off the coast of tihama , and there such zoophyte displays not only flourished below sea level but they also fashioned picturesque networks that unreeled as high as ten fathoms above it ; the latter were more whimsical but less colorful than the former , which kept their bloom thanks to the moist vitality of the waters .",122
