"it was real enjoyment to the settlers when in their room , well lighted with candles , well warmed with coal , after a good dinner , elderberry coffee smoking in the cups , the pipes giving forth an odoriferous smoke , they could hear the storm howling without .",40

"there were only two men in the room , sir henry and stapleton . they sat with their profiles towards me on either side of the round table . both of them were smoking cigars , and coffee and wine were in front of them . stapleton was talking with animation , but the baronet looked pale and distrait . perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the ill - omened moor was weighing heavily upon his mind .",33
""" they are both simply forms of imitation , "" remarked lord henry . "" but do let us go . dorian , you must not stay here any longer . it is not good for one 's morals to see bad acting . besides , i do n't suppose you will want your wife to act , so what does it matter if she plays juliet like a wooden doll ? she is very lovely , and if she knows as little about life as she does about acting , she will be a delightful experience . there are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating-- people who know absolutely everything , and people who know absolutely nothing . good heavens , my dear boy , do n't look so tragic ! the secret of remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming . come to the club with basil and myself . we will smoke cigarettes and drink to the beauty of sibyl vane . she is beautiful . what more can you want ?

"breathing that sea breeze , so much more invigorating and balsamic as the land is approached , contemplating all the power of those preparations she was commissioned to destroy , all the power of that army which she was to combat alone -- she , a woman with a few bags of gold -- milady compared herself mentally to judith , the terrible jewess , when she penetrated the camp of the assyrians and beheld the enormous mass of chariots , horses , men , and arms , which a gesture of her hand was to dissipate like a cloud of smoke .",101
"by nine o'clock we had pulled up to shore . the sky was growing brighter . clouds were fleeing to the south . mists were rising from the cold surface of the water . captain nemo headed toward the peak , which he no doubt planned to make his observatory . it was an arduous climb over sharp lava and pumice stones in the midst of air often reeking with sulfurous fumes from the smoke holes . for a man out of practice at treading land , the captain scaled the steepest slopes with a supple agility i could n't equal , and which would have been envied by hunters of pyrenees mountain goats .",74
"' you 'll get used to it in time , ' said the caterpillar ; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again .",25

"" are we being taken up in an eruption ? our fate has flung us here among burning lavas , molten rocks , boiling waters , and all kinds of volcanic matter ; we are going to be pitched out , expelled , tossed up , vomited , spit out high into the air , along with fragments of rock , showers of ashes and scoria , in the midst of a towering rush of smoke and flames ; and it is the best thing that could happen to us !

"naturally enough , the canadian wanted to lay in a supply of honey , and it would have been ill - mannered of me to say no . he mixed sulfur with some dry leaves , set them on fire with a spark from his tinderbox , and proceeded to smoke the bees out . little by little the buzzing died down and the disemboweled hive yielded several pounds of sweet honey . ned land stuffed his haversack with it .",50

"the next day , april 1 , when the nautilus rose to the surface of the waves a few minutes before noon , we raised land to the west . it was tierra del fuego , the land of fire , a name given it by early navigators after they saw numerous curls of smoke rising from the natives ' huts . this land of fire forms a huge cluster of islands over thirty leagues long and eighty leagues wide , extending between latitude 53 degrees and 56 degrees south , and between longitude 67 degrees 50 ' and 77 degrees 15 ' west . its coastline looked flat , but high mountains rose in the distance . i even thought i glimpsed mt . sarmiento , whose elevation is 2,070 meters above sea level : a pyramid - shaped block of shale with a very sharp summit , which , depending on whether it 's clear or veiled in vapor , "" predicts fair weather or foul , "" as ned land told me .",54

"a small fly or moth had fluttered across our path , and in an instant stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it . to my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire , and my acquaintance never paused for an instant , bounding from tuft to tuft behind it , his green net waving in the air . his gray clothes and jerky , zigzag , irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself . i was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the treacherous mire , when i heard the sound of steps , and turning round found a woman near me upon the path . she had come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of merripit house , but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close .",143

"from the corner of the divan of persian saddle - bags on which he was lying , smoking , as was his custom , innumerable cigarettes , lord henry wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey - sweet and honey- coloured blossoms of a laburnum , whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs ; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore - silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window , producing a kind of momentary japanese effect , and making him think of those pallid , jade - faced painters of tokio who , through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile , seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion .",17
