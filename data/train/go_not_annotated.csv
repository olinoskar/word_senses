"these wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the storm lasted , and indeed some time after ; but the next day the wind was abated , and the sea calmer , and i began to be a little inured to it ; however , i was very grave for all that day , being also a little sea - sick still ; but towards night the weather cleared up , the wind was quite over , and a charming fine evening followed ; the sun went down perfectly clear , and rose so the next morning ; and having little or no wind , and a smooth sea , the sun shining upon it , the sight was , as i thought , the most delightful that ever i saw .",87
"we were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship till we saw her sink , and then i understood for the first time what was meant by a ship foundering in the sea . i must acknowledge i had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told me she was sinking ; for from the moment that they rather put me into the boat than that i might be said to go in , my heart was , as it were , dead within me , partly with fright , partly with horror of mind , and the thoughts of what was yet before me .",78

"i made no answer , but went and sat forward . the northern shore was already beginning to dip under the horizon . the eastern and western strands spread wide as if to bid us farewell . before our eyes lay far and wide a vast sea ; shadows of great clouds swept heavily over its silver - grey surface ; the glistening bluish rays of electric light , here and there reflected by the dancing drops of spray , shot out little sheaves of light from the track we left in our rear . soon we entirely lost sight of land ; no object was left for the eye to judge by , and but for the frothy track of the raft , i might have thought we were standing still .",6
"after about two years , an odd circumstance presented itself , which put the old thought of making some attempt for my liberty again in my head . my patron lying at home longer than usual without fitting out his ship , which , as i heard , was for want of money , he used constantly , once or twice a week , sometimes oftener if the weather was fair , to take the ship ’s pinnace and go out into the road a - fishing ; and as he always took me and young maresco with him to row the boat , we made him very merry , and i proved very dexterous in catching fish ; insomuch that sometimes he would send me with a moor , one of his kinsmen , and the youth — the maresco , as they called him — to catch a dish of fish for him .",79
"it happened one time , that going a - fishing in a calm morning , a fog rose so thick that , though we were not half a league from the shore , we lost sight of it ; and rowing we knew not whither or which way , we laboured all day , and all the next night ; and when the morning came we found we had pulled off to sea instead of pulling in for the shore ; and that we were at least two leagues from the shore . however , we got well in again , though with a great deal of labour and some danger ; for the wind began to blow pretty fresh in the morning ; but we were all very hungry .",6
"i got all things ready as he had directed , and waited the next morning with the boat washed clean , her ancient and pendants out , and everything to accommodate his guests ; when by - and - by my patron came on board alone , and told me his guests had put off going from some business that fell out , and ordered me , with the man and boy , as usual , to go out with the boat and catch them some fish , for that his friends were to sup at his house , and commanded that as soon as i got some fish i should bring it home to his house ; all which i prepared to do .",55

"my first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this moor , to get something for our subsistence on board ; for i told him we must not presume to eat of our patron ’s bread . he said that was true ; so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit , and three jars of fresh water , into the boat . i knew where my patron ’s case of bottles stood , which it was evident , by the make , were taken out of some english prize , and i conveyed them into the boat while the moor was on shore , as if they had been there before for our master . i conveyed also a great lump of beeswax into the boat , which weighed about half a hundred - weight , with a parcel of twine or thread , a hatchet , a saw , and a hammer , all of which were of great use to us afterwards , especially the wax , to make candles . another trick i tried upon him , which he innocently came into also : his name was ismael , which they call muley , or moely ; so i called to him—“moely , ” said i , “ our patron ’s guns are on board the boat ; can you not get a little powder and shot ? it may be we may kill some alcamies ( a fowl like our curlews ) for ourselves , for i know he keeps the gunner ’s stores in the ship . ” “ yes , ” says he , “ i ’ll bring some ; ” and accordingly he brought a great leather pouch , which held a pound and a half of powder , or rather more ; and another with shot , that had five or six pounds , with some bullets , and put all into the boat . at the same time i had found some powder of my master ’s in the great cabin , with which i filled one of the large bottles in the case , which was almost empty , pouring what was in it into another ; and thus furnished with everything needful , we sailed out of the port to fish . the castle , which is at the entrance of the port , knew who we were , and took no notice of us ; and we were not above a mile out of the port before we hauled in our sail and set us down to fish . the wind blew from the n.n.e . , which was contrary to my desire , for had it blown southerly i had been sure to have made the coast of spain , and at least reached to the bay of cadiz ; but my resolutions were , blow which way it would , i would be gone from that horrid place where i was , and leave the rest to fate .",492

"while i was in view of the moor that was swimming , i stood out directly to sea with the boat , rather stretching to windward , that they might think me gone towards the straits ’ mouth ( as indeed any one that had been in their wits must have been supposed to do ) : for who would have supposed we were sailed on to the southward , to the truly barbarian coast , where whole nations of negroes were sure to surround us with their canoes and destroy us ; where we could not go on shore but we should be devoured by savage beasts , or more merciless savages of human kind .",32

"i did not care to go out of sight of the boat , fearing the coming of canoes with savages down the river ; but the boy seeing a low place about a mile up the country , rambled to it , and by - and - by i saw him come running towards me . i thought he was pursued by some savage , or frighted with some wild beast , and i ran forward towards him to help him ; but when i came nearer to him i saw something hanging over his shoulders , which was a creature that he had shot , like a hare , but different in colour , and longer legs ; however , we were very glad of it , and it was very good meat ; but the great joy that poor xury came with , was to tell me he had found good water and seen no wild mans .",5
"but we found afterwards that we need not take such pains for water , for a little higher up the creek where we were we found the water fresh when the tide was out , which flowed but a little way up ; so we filled our jars , and feasted on the hare he had killed , and prepared to go on our way , having seen no footsteps of any human creature in that part of the country .",61

"alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like , but it puzzled her too much , so she went on : ' but why did they live at the bottom of a well ? '",26
"' there 's no such thing ! ' alice was beginning very angrily , but the hatter and the march hare went ' sh ! sh ! ' and the dormouse sulkily remarked , ' if you ca n't be civil , you 'd better finish the story for yourself . '",21

"upon their arrival at venice candide went in search of cacambo at every inn and coffee - house , and among all the ladies of pleasure , but could hear nothing of him . he sent every day to inquire what ships were in , still no news of cacambo .",6
"this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear : she got up in great disgust , and walked off ; the dormouse fell asleep instantly , and neither of the others took the least notice of her going , though she looked back once or twice , half hoping that they would call after her : the last time she saw them , they were trying to put the dormouse into the teapot .",39
"he fell into a deep melancholy , and neither went to the opera then in vogue , nor partook of any of the diversions of the carnival ; nay , he even slighted the fair sex .",9

"just as she said this , she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it . ' that 's very curious ! ' she thought . ' but everything 's curious today . i think i may as well go in at once . ' and in she went .",44
"once more she found herself in the long hall , and close to the little glass table . ' now , i 'll manage better this time , ' she said to herself , and began by taking the little golden key , and unlocking the door that led into the garden . then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom ( she had kept a piece of it in her pocket ) till she was about a foot high : then she walked down the little passage : and then -- she found herself at last in the beautiful garden , among the bright flower - beds and the cool fountains .",55
"a large rose - tree stood near the entrance of the garden : the roses growing on it were white , but there were three gardeners at it , busily painting them red . alice thought this a very curious thing , and she went nearer to watch them , and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say , ' look out now , five ! do n't go splashing paint over me like that !

"d’artagnan left the hotel instead of going up at once to kitty ’s chamber , as she endeavored to persuade him to do -- and that for two reasons : the first , because by this means he should escape reproaches , recriminations , and prayers ; the second , because he was not sorry to have an opportunity of reading his own thoughts and endeavoring , if possible , to fathom those of this woman .",6
"it is true i have preached often paltry sermons , by which i have got a little money , part of which the prior robs me of , and the remainder helps to pay my girls ; but , not withstanding , at night , when i go hence to my monastery , i am ready to dash my brains against the walls of the dormitory ; and this is the case with all the rest of our fraternity .

"in an instant d’artagnan perceived that the best way in which he could act would be to go home and write milady a long letter , in which he would confess to her that he and de wardes were , up to the present moment absolutely the same , and that consequently he could not undertake , without committing suicide , to kill the comte de wardes .",17

"the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo : she succeeded in getting its body tucked away , comfortably enough , under her arm , with its legs hanging down , but generally , just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out , and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head , it would twist itself round and look up in her face , with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing : and when she had got its head down , and was going to begin again , it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself , and was in the act of crawling away : besides all this , there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to , and , as the doubled - up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground , alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed .",51

"' who are you talking to ? ' said the king , going up to alice , and looking at the cat 's head with great curiosity .",12
"the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog , which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other : the only difficulty was , that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden , where alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree .",36
"by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back , the fight was over , and both the hedgehogs were out of sight : ' but it does n't matter much , ' thought alice , ' as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground . ' so she tucked it away under her arm , that it might not escape again , and went back for a little more conversation with her friend .",71
"when she got back to the cheshire cat , she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it : there was a dispute going on between the executioner , the king , and the queen , who were all talking at once , while all the rest were quite silent , and looked very uncomfortable .",26
"the executioner 's argument was , that you could n't cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from : that he had never had to do such a thing before , and he was n't going to begin at his time of life .",41
