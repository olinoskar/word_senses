"near midnight the sea suddenly resumed its usual hue , but behind us all the way to the horizon , the skies kept mirroring the whiteness of those waves and for a good while seemed imbued with the hazy glow of an aurora borealis .",5
"there conseil 's work came to a halt . he did n't have time to finish off the class crustacea through an examination of its stomatopods , amphipods , homopods , isopods , trilobites , branchiopods , ostracods , and entomostraceans . and in order to complete his study of marine articulates , he needed to mention the class cirripedia , which contains water fleas and carp lice , plus the class annelida , which he would have divided without fail into tubifex worms and dorsibranchian worms . but having gone past the shallows of the strait of sicily , the nautilus resumed its usual deep - water speed . from then on , no more mollusks , no more zoophytes , no more articulates . just a few large fish sweeping by like shadows .",102
"then , resuming his mild air , "" you are deceived , gentlemen , "" said he , "" this handkerchief is not mine , and i can not fancy why monsieur has taken it into his head to offer it to me rather than to one of you ; and as a proof of what i say , here is mine in my pocket . """,2
"miss temple got up , took her hand and examined her pulse ; then she returned to her own seat : as she resumed it , i heard her sigh low .",23
"fix did not have the same thoughts , and could scarcely conceal his agitation . he walked feverishly up and down the platform , but soon resumed his outward composure . he now saw the folly of which he had been guilty in letting fogg go alone . what ! this man , whom he had just followed around the world , was permitted now to separate himself from him ! he began to accuse and abuse himself , and , as if he were director of police , administered to himself a sound lecture for his greenness .",26
""" this horse is decidedly , or rather has been in his youth , a buttercup , "" resumed the stranger , continuing the remarks he had begun , and addressing himself to his auditors at the window , without paying the least attention to the exasperation of d’artagnan , who , however placed himself between him and them .

the travellers were glad to see the locomotive resume its place at the head of the train . they could now continue the journey so terribly interrupted .,8

"the walk , interrupted for an instant , was resumed .",9

"the queen was still standing when he entered ; but scarcely had she perceived him then she reseated herself in her armchair , and made a sign to her women to resume their cushions and stools , and with an air of supreme hauteur , said , "" what do you desire , monsieur , and with what object do you present yourself here ? """,31
"i stood there until six o'clock in the morning , captain nemo never seeming to notice me . the vessel lay a mile and a half off , and with the first glimmers of daylight , it resumed its cannonade . the time could n't be far away when the nautilus would attack its adversary , and my companions and i would leave forever this man i dared not judge .",37
"passepartout , at this , looked attentively at his companion . fix 's face seemed to have a singular expression . he resumed his seat .",22

""" well , uncle , we are going to resume the northern route , and to pass under the north countries of europe -- under sweden , russia , siberia : who knows where?--instead of burrowing under the deserts of africa , or perhaps the waves of the atlantic ; and that is all i want to know . """,9
"around the nautilus for a half - mile radius , the waters seemed saturated with electric light . the sandy bottom was clear and bright . dressed in diving suits , crewmen were busy clearing away half - rotted barrels and disemboweled trunks in the midst of the dingy hulks of ships . out of these trunks and kegs spilled ingots of gold and silver , cascades of jewels , pieces of eight . the sand was heaped with them . then , laden with these valuable spoils , the men returned to the nautilus , dropped off their burdens inside , and went to resume this inexhaustible fishing for silver and gold .",105
"i , on the contrary , became more cheerful , and took fresh courage : these last words gave me an insight as to where the difficulty lay ; and as it was no difficulty with me , i felt quite relieved from my previous embarrassment . i resumed a livelier vein of conversation .",48

"he gave his orders . the abraham lincoln stayed at half steam , advancing cautiously so as not to awaken its adversary . in midocean it 's not unusual to encounter whales so sound asleep they can successfully be attacked , and ned land had harpooned more than one in its slumber . the canadian went to resume his post on the bobstays under the bowsprit .",57
"he was awaiting one of two events , either the appearance of a vertical well opening before his feet , down which our descent might be resumed , or that of some obstacle which should effectually turn us back on our own footsteps . but evening came and neither wish was gratified .",26
""" you would not , then , prefer a method , "" resumed d’artagnan , "" which would equally avenge you while rendering the combat useless ? """,12
"i remark that professor liedenbrock has a tendency to relapse into an impatient mood , and i make a note of it in my log . all my danger and sufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him ; but now that i am well his nature has resumed its sway . and yet , what cause was there for anger ? is not the voyage prospering as favourably as possible under the circumstances ? is not the raft spinning along with marvellous speed ?",53
"certainly , the former savage of tabor island could not be perplexed how to live in the forest , abounding in game , but was it not to be feared that he had resumed his habits , and that this freedom would revive in him his wild instincts ?",33
""" the nautilus is not aground , sir , "" captain nemo replied icily .

"no : stillness returned : each murmur and movement ceased gradually , and in about an hour thornfield hall was again as hushed as a desert . it seemed that sleep and night had resumed their empire .",34
"the journey was resumed at six in the morning ; the guide hoped to reach allahabad by evening . in that case , mr . fogg would only lose a part of the forty - eight hours saved since the beginning of the tour . kiouni , resuming his rapid gait , soon descended the lower spurs of the vindhias , and towards noon they passed by the village of kallenger , on the cani , one of the branches of the ganges . the guide avoided inhabited places , thinking it safer to keep the open country , which lies along the first depressions of the basin of the great river . allahabad was now only twelve miles to the north - east . they stopped under a clump of bananas , the fruit of which , as healthy as bread and as succulent as cream , was amply partaken of and appreciated .",3

"as d’artagnan was tolerably reassured with regard to porthos , and as he was anxious to obtain news of his two other friends , he held out his hand to the wounded man , and told him he was about to resume his route in order to continue his researches .",41
"d’artagnan wished that answer might be prompt and favorable ; and having again recommended porthos to the care of mousqueton , and paid his bill to the host , he resumed his route with planchet , already relieved of one of his led horses .",30
"passepartout was waiting for his master , armed with half a dozen six - barrelled revolvers . when he perceived fix , he knit his brows ; but aouda having , in a few words , told him of their adventure , his countenance resumed its placid expression . fix evidently was no longer an enemy , but an ally ; he was faithfully keeping his word .",44

gideon spilett had resumed his examination of the wounded boy .,3
"the following day , january 10 , the nautilus resumed its travels in midwater but at a remarkable speed that i estimated to be at least thirty - five miles per hour . the propeller was going so fast i could neither follow nor count its revolutions .",9
he found athos and aramis philosophizing . aramis had some slight inclination to resume the cassock .,13
"the voyage resumes its uniform tenor , which i do n't care to break with a repetition of such events as yesterday 's .",2
""" however , "" resumed the guide , "" it is certain , not only that we shall risk our lives , but horrible tortures , if we are taken . """,4
"having rapidly taken notice of all this , i resumed the narrative of sir launcelot , which thus proceeded :",9
"having identified the animal , which they did not disturb , gideon spilett erased "" bear "" from the title of his sketch , putting koala in its place , and the journey was resumed .",34
"and she resumed her seat , as if plunged in reflections entirely personal .",2
"they set noiselessly to work , and the parsee on one side and passepartout on the other began to loosen the bricks so as to make an aperture two feet wide . they were getting on rapidly , when suddenly a cry was heard in the interior of the temple , followed almost instantly by other cries replying from the outside . passepartout and the guide stopped . had they been heard ? was the alarm being given ? common prudence urged them to retire , and they did so , followed by phileas fogg and sir francis . they again hid themselves in the wood , and waited till the disturbance , whatever it might be , ceased , holding themselves ready to resume their attempt without delay . but , awkwardly enough , the guards now appeared at the rear of the temple , and there installed themselves , in readiness to prevent a surprise .",124
"finally captain nemo regained his self - control . his facial appearance , so profoundly changed , now resumed its usual calm . he addressed a few words to his chief officer in their strange language , then he turned to me :",18
"aramis resumed his pen , reflected a little , and wrote the following lines , which he immediately submitted to the approbation of his friends . "" my dear cousin . """,1
"ten days went by in this way . it was only on may 1 that the nautilus openly resumed its northbound course , after raising the bahamas at the mouth of old bahama channel . we then went with the current of the sea 's greatest river , which has its own banks , fish , and temperature . i mean the gulf stream .",18
""" as you please , sir , "" replied phileas fogg , heartily glad to resume his favourite pastime even on the railway .",15
they resumed their route .,1
"after a comfortable breakfast , served in the car , mr . fogg and his partners had just resumed whist , when a violent whistling was heard , and the train stopped . passepartout put his head out of the door , but saw nothing to cause the delay ; no station was in view .",18
"the station at allahabad was reached about ten o'clock , and , the interrupted line of railway being resumed , would enable them to reach calcutta in less than twenty - four hours . phileas fogg would thus be able to arrive in time to take the steamer which left calcutta the next day , october 25th , at noon , for hong kong .",18
"near two o'clock i was busy organizing my notes in the lounge , when the captain opened the door and appeared . i bowed to him . he gave me an almost imperceptible bow in return , without saying a word to me . i resumed my work , hoping he might give me some explanation of the previous afternoon 's events . he did nothing of the sort . i stared at him . his face looked exhausted ; his reddened eyes had n't been refreshed by sleep ; his facial features expressed profound sadness , real chagrin . he walked up and down , sat and stood , picked up a book at random , discarded it immediately , consulted his instruments without taking his customary notes , and seemed unable to rest easy for an instant .",45
"the operation finished , to the great satisfaction of the operators , the remains of the animal were left to the birds , who would soon make every vestige of it disappear , and their usual daily occupations were resumed by the inmates of granite house .",39
"i breathed again : my blood resumed its flow . fully assured by these words that mr . edward--_my _ mr . rochester ( god bless him , wherever he was!)--was at least alive : was , in short , "" the present gentleman . """,6
"he went and resumed his post , beginning to be rather uneasy at this silence and this solitude .",3
"but no one heard this sage reflection , nor would anyone have acknowledged its justice . the passengers resumed their places in the cars . passepartout took his seat without telling what had passed . the whist - players were quite absorbed in their game .",18
"our return journey began . captain nemo resumed the lead in our little band , always heading forward without hesitation . i noted that we did n't follow the same path in returning to the nautilus . this new route , very steep and hence very arduous , quickly took us close to the surface of the sea . but this return to the upper strata was n't so sudden that decompression took place too quickly , which could have led to serious organic disorders and given us those internal injuries so fatal to divers . with great promptness , the light reappeared and grew stronger ; and the refraction of the sun , already low on the horizon , again ringed the edges of various objects with the entire color spectrum .",7
""" but , for heaven ’s sake- "" resumed aramis .",8
""" excuse me , "" said d’artagnan , endeavoring to resume his course , "" excuse me , but i am in a hurry . """,10
"of course , down this fault the hansbach fell in a cascade , and lost some of its volume ; but there was enough and to spare to slake our thirst . besides , when the incline became more gentle , it would of course resume its peaceable course . at this moment it reminded me of my worthy uncle , in his frequent fits of impatience and anger , while below it ran with the calmness of the icelandic hunter .",45
"he now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before tea . i soon withdrew , for i had talked as much , and sat up as long , as my present strength would permit .",2
""" well , "" resumed mr . rochester , "" if you disown parents , you must have some sort of kinsfolk : uncles and aunts ? """,4
