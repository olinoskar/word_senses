""" no , my boy , and this whiteness that amazes you is merely due to the presence of myriads of tiny creatures called infusoria , a sort of diminutive glowworm that 's colorless and gelatinous in appearance , as thick as a strand of hair , and no longer than one - fifth of a millimeter . some of these tiny creatures stick together over an area of several leagues .

"the only tools the settlers took were the two woodmen 's axes , which they could use to cut a path through the thick forests , as also the instruments , the telescope and pocket - compass .",23
"in fact , on emerging from beneath a thick clump of beautiful trees , it suddenly appeared before their eyes .",8
"two miles were cleared in this direction , and then , after they had passed the last curtain of trees , appeared the plateau , carpeted with thick turf , and beyond that the infinite sea .",27
"besides , there were fewer to feed ; the sick could eat little ; our breakfast - basins were better filled ; when there was no time to prepare a regular dinner , which often happened , she would give us a large piece of cold pie , or a thick slice of bread and cheese , and this we carried away with us to the wood , where we each chose the spot we liked best , and dined sumptuously .",50
"then i began to lose my head . i arose with my arms stretched out before me , attempting painfully to feel my way . i began to run wildly , hurrying through the inextricable maze , still descending , still running through the substance of the earth 's thick crust , a struggling denizen of geological ' faults , ' crying , shouting , yelling , soon bruised by contact with the jagged rock , falling and rising again bleeding , trying to drink the blood which covered my face , and even waiting for some rock to shatter my skull against .",49
"it was both fatigue spared and time gained , for they would have been obliged to cut a path through the thick wood with their axes .",21
"nearly five minutes passed thus , top rummaging , the reporter following him prudently when , all at once , the dog rushed towards a thick bush , and drew out a rag .",25

"a true northerner , thin , bony , lean , about forty - five years of age ; his close - cut hair and his beard , of which he only kept a thick mustache , were already getting gray .",33
"the boat was pushed on through the forest , which gradually became thicker again , and appeared also to have more inhabitants ; for if the eyes of the sailor did not deceive him , he thought he saw bands of monkeys springing among the trees .",12
"the poor fowl was thin , and covered with one of those thick , bristly skins through which the teeth can not penetrate with all their efforts . the fowl must have been sought for a long time on the perch , to which it had retired to die of old age .",12
"the last rays of the sun gleamed through the thick foliage and glanced on the little waterfall , making the spray sparkle with all the colors of the rainbow .",9
"when i came to myself , i was stretched in half darkness , covered with thick coats and blankets . my uncle was watching over me , to discover the least sign of life . at my first sigh he took my hand ; when i opened my eyes he uttered a cry of joy .",15

"endowed doubtless with sight which enabled him to pierce the obscurity , he was always in the thick of the fight uttering from time to time -- a sharp hissing sound , which was with him the sign of great rejoicing .",17
"the shellfish meleagrina , that womb for pearls whose valves are nearly equal in size , has the shape of a round shell with thick walls and a very rough exterior . some of these shells were furrowed with flaky , greenish bands that radiated down from the top . these were the young oysters . the others had rugged black surfaces , measured up to fifteen centimeters in width , and were ten or more years old .",24
"sweeping over the islet , it had furiously assailed the passages , half filling them with sand , while thick beds of seaweed covered the rocks .",19
"after two hours of work , reentering to snatch some food and rest , i found a noticeable difference between the clean elastic fluid supplied me by the rouquayrol device and the nautilus 's atmosphere , which was already charged with carbon dioxide . the air had n't been renewed in forty - eight hours , and its life - giving qualities were considerably weakened . meanwhile , after twelve hours had gone by , we had removed from the outlined surface area a slice of ice only one meter thick , hence about 600 cubic meters . assuming the same work would be accomplished every twelve hours , it would still take five nights and four days to see the undertaking through to completion .",90
""" they 'd need to be manufactured , "" ned land replied , "" from sheet - iron plates eight inches thick , like ironclad frigates . """,21

"he cast on me a glance of surprise ; but without answering , he cut a thick slice from his loaf , and gave it to me .",16
"just then the whole crew returned on board , and the double outside door was closed . by this point the nautilus was resting on a bed of ice only one meter thick and drilled by bores in a thousand places .",32
"in consequence and in view of these future establishments , it became of much importance that they should penetrate into all the yet unknown parts of lincoln island , that is to say , through that thick forest which extended on the right bank of the mercy , from its mouth to the extremity of the serpentine peninsula , as well as on the whole of its western side .",36

they slanted more towards the southwest and again entered among thick bushes .,10
"going back under the waters , the nautilus drew near the coast , cruising along it for only a few miles . through the lounge windows i could see long creepers and gigantic fucus plants , bulb - bearing seaweed of which the open sea at the pole had revealed a few specimens ; with their smooth , viscous filaments , they measured as much as 300 meters long ; genuine cables more than an inch thick and very tough , they 're often used as mooring lines for ships . another weed , known by the name velp and boasting four - foot leaves , was crammed into the coral concretions and carpeted the ocean floor . it served as both nest and nourishment for myriads of crustaceans and mollusks , for crabs and cuttlefish . here seals and otters could indulge in a sumptuous meal , mixing meat from fish with vegetables from the sea , like the english with their irish stews .",76
""" a servant ! "" cried mr . batulcar , caressing the thick grey beard which hung from his chin .

"all the colonists , their services thus requisitioned by pencroft , descended to the dockyard , and proceeded to place the keelson , a thick mass of wood which forms the lower portion of a ship and unites firmly the timbers of the hull .",24
""" no , "" replied pencroft , "" for the sky was covered with thick clouds , and at any rate a star would not have been so low on the horizon .",14
""" because this stick , though originally a very handsome one has been so knocked about that i can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it . the thick - iron ferrule is worn down , so it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with it . """,28
"blindly we ran through the gloom , blundering against boulders , forcing our way through gorse bushes , panting up hills and rushing down slopes , heading always in the direction whence those dreadful sounds had come . at every rise holmes looked eagerly round him , but the shadows were thick upon the moor , and nothing moved upon its dreary face .",51
divine justice pursued its course ; disasters came thick on me : i was forced to pass through the valley of the shadow of death . _ his _ chastisements are mighty ; and one smote me which has humbled me for ever .,8
"the guide unloosed the elephant and led him into a thicket , at the same time asking the travellers not to stir . he held himself ready to bestride the animal at a moment 's notice , should flight become necessary ; but he evidently thought that the procession of the faithful would pass without perceiving them amid the thick foliage , in which they were wholly concealed .",59

"i liked the hush , the gloom , the quaintness of these retreats in the day ; but i by no means coveted a night 's repose on one of those wide and heavy beds : shut in , some of them , with doors of oak ; shaded , others , with wrought old english hangings crusted with thick work , portraying effigies of strange flowers , and stranger birds , and strangest human beings,--all which would have looked strange , indeed , by the pallid gleam of moonlight .",59

"and then she had such a fine head of hair ; raven - black and so becomingly arranged : a crown of thick plaits behind , and in front the longest , the glossiest curls i ever saw .",22
"the road led through jacamar wood , which they traversed obliquely from southeast to northwest , and in the thickest part .",19
"the exploration of these dense masses of wood was difficult in the extreme , and the reporter never ventured there without the pocket - compass , for the sun scarcely pierced through the thick foliage and it would have been very difficult for them to retrace their way .",33
"an hour after their departure they arrived on the southern point of the islet , terminated by a sharp cape , and proceeded towards the north along the western coast , equally formed by sand and rocks , the background bordered with thick woods .",42
"mrs . vane glanced at her , and with one of those false theatrical gestures that so often become a mode of second nature to a stage - player , clasped her in her arms . at this moment , the door opened and a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room . he was thick - set of figure , and his hands and feet were large and somewhat clumsy in movement . he was not so finely bred as his sister . one would hardly have guessed the close relationship that existed between them . mrs . vane fixed her eyes on him and intensified her smile . she mentally elevated her son to the dignity of an audience . she felt sure that the tableau was interesting .",58
"what rage then drove us against these monsters ! we lost all self - control . ten or twelve devilfish had overrun the nautilus 's platform and sides . we piled helter - skelter into the thick of these sawed - off snakes , which darted over the platform amid waves of blood and sepia ink . it seemed as if these viscous tentacles grew back like the many heads of hydra . at every thrust ned land 's harpoon would plunge into a squid 's sea - green eye and burst it . but my daring companion was suddenly toppled by the tentacles of a monster he could not avoid .",36
"a few hours passed away . a deep silence reigned around us , the silence of the grave . no sound could reach us through walls , the thinnest of which were five miles thick .",34
"as for me , what had harrowed my heart in the thick of this struggle was the despairing yell given by this unfortunate man . forgetting his regulation language , this poor frenchman had reverted to speaking his own mother tongue to fling out one supreme plea ! among the nautilus 's crew , allied body and soul with captain nemo and likewise fleeing from human contact , i had found a fellow countryman ! was he the only representative of france in this mysterious alliance , obviously made up of individuals from different nationalities ? this was just one more of those insoluble problems that kept welling up in my mind !",11

"i can now conjecture readily that this streak of light was , in all likelihood , a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn : but then , prepared as my mind was for horror , shaken as my nerves were by agitation , i thought the swift darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world . my heart beat thick , my head grew hot ; a sound filled my ears , which i deemed the rushing of wings ; something seemed near me ; i was oppressed , suffocated : endurance broke down ; i rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort .",68
"the next thing i remember is , waking up with a feeling as if i had had a frightful nightmare , and seeing before me a terrible red glare , crossed with thick black bars .",32

"it was about two hours before night when , our guide being something before us , and not just in sight , out rushed three monstrous wolves , and after them a bear , from a hollow way adjoining to a thick wood ; two of the wolves made at the guide , and had he been far before us , he would have been devoured before we could have helped him ; one of them fastened upon his horse , and the other attacked the man with such violence , that he had not time , or presence of mind enough , to draw his pistol , but hallooed and cried out to us most lustily . my man friday being next me , i bade him ride up and see what was the matter . as soon as friday came in sight of the man , he hallooed out as loud as the other , “ o master ! o master ! ” but like a bold fellow , rode directly up to the poor man , and with his pistol shot the wolf in the head that attacked him .",41
"of this wine , the first bottle being a little thick at the bottom , brisemont poured the lees into a glass , and d’artagnan desired him to drink it , for the poor devil had not yet recovered his strength .",10

"important changes had occurred ; great blocks of stone lay on the beach , which was also covered with a thick carpet of sea - weed , algae , and wrack .",20
"it was during the night of december 9 - 10 that the nautilus encountered this army of distinctly nocturnal mollusks . they numbered in the millions . they were migrating from the temperate zones toward zones still warmer , following the itineraries of herring and sardines . we stared at them through our thick glass windows : they swam backward with tremendous speed , moving by means of their locomotive tubes , chasing fish and mollusks , eating the little ones , eaten by the big ones , and tossing in indescribable confusion the ten feet that nature has rooted in their heads like a hairpiece of pneumatic snakes . despite its speed , the nautilus navigated for several hours in the midst of this school of animals , and its nets brought up an incalculable number , among which i recognized all nine species that professor orbigny has classified as native to the pacific ocean .",53
"the soil sloped gradually from mount franklin to the east coast , and it was to be feared that , in spite of the thick jacamar wood , the torrent would reach the plateau of prospect heights .",24
"beneath the lower point of the balloon swung a car , containing five passengers , scarcely visible in the midst of the thick vapor mingled with spray which hung over the surface of the ocean .",22
"he struggled madly for life , and by a terrible effort wrenched the tightening fingers away . in a second he heard the click of a revolver , and saw the gleam of a polished barrel , pointing straight at his head , and the dusky form of a short , thick - set man facing him .",51
"so she swallowed one of the cakes , and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly . as soon as she was small enough to get through the door , she ran out of the house , and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside . the poor little lizard , bill , was in the middle , being held up by two guinea - pigs , who were giving it something out of a bottle . they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared ; but she ran off as hard as she could , and soon found herself safe in a thick wood .",112
"the sulphur spring not being of any actual use to the settlers , they proceeded towards the thick border of the forest , which began some hundred paces off .",17
"however , the mystery which enveloped its strange destruction would doubtless never have been cleared away if , on the 30th of november , neb , strolling on the beach , had not found a piece of a thick iron cylinder , bearing traces of explosion .",38
"aouda was safe ; and phileas fogg , who had been in the thickest of the fight , had not received a scratch . fix was slightly wounded in the arm . but passepartout was not to be found , and tears coursed down aouda 's cheeks .",13
