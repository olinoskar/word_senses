"in the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the sierra blanco . as far as the eye can reach stretches the great flat plain - land , all dusted over with patches of alkali , and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes . on the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks , with their rugged summits flecked with snow . in this great stretch of country there is no sign of life , nor of anything appertaining to life . there is no bird in the steel - blue heaven , no movement upon the dull , grey earth — above all , there is absolute silence . listen as one may , there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness ; nothing but silence — complete and heart - subduing silence . it has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain . that is hardly true . looking down from the sierra blanco , one sees a pathway traced out across the desert , which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance . it is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers . here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun , and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali . approach , and examine them ! they are bones : some large and coarse , others smaller and more delicate . the former have belonged to oxen , and the latter to men . for fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside .",87
