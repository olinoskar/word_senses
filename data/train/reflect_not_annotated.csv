""" this parlour is not his sphere , "" i reflected : "" the himalayan ridge or caffre bush , even the plague - cursed guinea coast swamp would suit him better .",10
"then turning toward that one of the guards who had declared himself the friend of bois - tracy , "" besides , "" continued he , "" i have reflected , my dear intimate of bois - tracy , that i am not less tenderly his friend than you can possibly be ; so that decidedly this handkerchief is as likely to have fallen from your pocket as mine .

"she reflected likewise that the cardinal would be furious at her return , and consequently would be more disposed to listen to the complaints brought against her than to the accusations she brought against others .",1
""" athos , she is your wife , i tell you , "" repeated d’artagnan ; "" only reflect how much the two descriptions resemble each other . """,18
""" reflect , athos ! """,1
"the moon then passed its zenith . jupiter was rising in the east . in the midst of this placid natural setting , sky and ocean competed with each other in tranquility , and the sea offered the orb of night the loveliest mirror ever to reflect its image .",46
"the vessel was two miles off . it drew nearer , always moving toward the phosphorescent glow that signaled the nautilus 's presence . i saw its green and red running lights , plus the white lantern hanging from the large stay of its foremast . hazy flickerings were reflected on its rigging and indicated that its furnaces were pushed to the limit . showers of sparks and cinders of flaming coal escaped from its funnels , spangling the air with stars .",49
". . . . during this time i had been reflecting . a vague hope was returning to my heart . there was one thing i must know to begin with . i placed my lips close to the wall , saying :",10
"the ceiling lights were off , yet the lounge was still brightly lit . this was due to the reflecting power of the walls of ice , which threw the beams of our beacon right back at us . words can not describe the effects produced by our galvanic rays on these huge , whimsically sculpted blocks , whose every angle , ridge , and facet gave off a different glow depending on the nature of the veins running inside the ice . it was a dazzling mine of gems , in particular sapphires and emeralds , whose jets of blue and green crisscrossed . here and there , opaline hues of infinite subtlety raced among sparks of light that were like so many fiery diamonds , their brilliance more than any eye could stand . the power of our beacon was increased a hundredfold , like a lamp shining through the biconvex lenses of a world - class lighthouse .",19
"reflect upon it . """,0
"what a sight ! how can i describe it ! how can i portray these woods and rocks in this liquid setting , their lower parts dark and sullen , their upper parts tinted red in this light whose intensity was doubled by the reflecting power of the waters ! we scaled rocks that crumbled behind us , collapsing in enormous sections with the hollow rumble of an avalanche . to our right and left there were carved gloomy galleries where the eye lost its way . huge glades opened up , seemingly cleared by the hand of man , and i sometimes wondered whether some residents of these underwater regions would suddenly appear before me .",44
"passepartout was on the point of vigorously resenting the epithet , the reason of which he could not for the life of him comprehend ; but he reflected that the unfortunate fix was probably very much disappointed and humiliated in his self - esteem , after having so awkwardly followed a false scent around the world , and refrained .",27
""" oh , my best ! oh , my dearest ! pause -- reflect ! "" was her mama 's cry ; but she swept past her in stately silence , passed through the door which colonel dent held open , and we heard her enter the library . a comparative silence ensued .",13
"it was possible , i reflected , that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene , of the details of the picture , would be sufficient to modify , or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression ; and , acting upon this idea , i reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling , and gazed down — but with a shudder even more thrilling than before — upon the remodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge , and the ghastly tree - stems , and the vacant and eye - like windows .",5
""" i like this day ; i like that sky of steel ; i like the sternness and stillness of the world under this frost . i like thornfield , its antiquity , its retirement , its old crow - trees and thorn - trees , its grey facade , and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin : and yet how long have i abhorred the very thought of it , shunned it like a great plague - house ? how i do still abhor-- """,55
""" well , i would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented road , "" i reflected . "" and far better that crows and ravens -- if any ravens there be in these regions -- should pick my flesh from my bones , than that they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper 's grave .

"i could see clearly a room with a sanded floor , clean scoured ; a dresser of walnut , with pewter plates ranged in rows , reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing peat - fire .",26

"as he was reflecting in this wise , his eyes fell upon an immense placard which a sort of clown was carrying through the streets . this placard , which was in english , read as follows :",3
by mid - day there was a change in the appearance of this wall of the gallery . i noticed it by a diminution of the amount of light reflected from the sides ; solid rock was appearing in the place of the lava coating . the mass was composed of inclined and sometimes vertical strata . we were passing through rocks of the transition or silurian [ 1 ] system .,29
"jealousy , fury , offended pride , all the passions in short that dispute the heart of an outraged woman in love , urged her to make a revelation ; but she reflected that she would be totally lost if she confessed having assisted in such a machination , and above all , that d’artagnan would also be lost to her forever .",32
"i made no answer , but went and sat forward . the northern shore was already beginning to dip under the horizon . the eastern and western strands spread wide as if to bid us farewell . before our eyes lay far and wide a vast sea ; shadows of great clouds swept heavily over its silver - grey surface ; the glistening bluish rays of electric light , here and there reflected by the dancing drops of spray , shot out little sheaves of light from the track we left in our rear . soon we entirely lost sight of land ; no object was left for the eye to judge by , and but for the frothy track of the raft , i might have thought we were standing still .",72
"in this manner i used to look upon my condition with the utmost regret . i had nobody to converse with , but now and then this neighbour ; no work to be done , but by the labour of my hands ; and i used to say , i lived just like a man cast away upon some desolate island , that had nobody there but himself . but how just has it been — and how should all men reflect , that when they compare their present conditions with others that are worse , heaven may oblige them to make the exchange , and be convinced of their former felicity by their experience — i say , how just has it been , that the truly solitary life i reflected on , in an island of mere desolation , should be my lot , who had so often unjustly compared it with the life which i then led , in which , had i continued , i had in all probability been exceeding prosperous and rich .",131
"the electric light was reflected in sparkling splendour from the schist , limestone , and old red sandstone of the walls . it might have been thought that we were passing through a section of wales , of which an ancient people gave its name to this system . specimens of magnificent marbles clothed the walls , some of a greyish agate fantastically veined with white , others of rich crimson or yellow dashed with splotches of red ; then came dark cherry - coloured marbles relieved by the lighter tints of limestone .",4
"lastly , beyond and above the plateau , in a northwesterly direction and at a distance of at least seven miles , glittered a white summit which reflected the sun 's rays .",27
"a sudden thought struck him . he put on his fur coat and hat and went out into the hall . there he paused , hearing the slow heavy tread of the policeman on the pavement outside and seeing the flash of the bull's - eye reflected in the window . he waited and held his breath .",46

"sir francis cromarty took mr . fogg aside , and begged him to reflect before he went any further ; to which that gentleman replied that he was not in the habit of acting rashly , that a bet of twenty thousand pounds was at stake , that the elephant was absolutely necessary to him , and that he would secure him if he had to pay twenty times his value . returning to the indian , whose small , sharp eyes , glistening with avarice , betrayed that with him it was only a question of how great a price he could obtain . mr . fogg offered first twelve hundred , then fifteen hundred , eighteen hundred , two thousand pounds . passepartout , usually so rubicund , was fairly white with suspense .",13
""" yet , "" i reflected , "" she has been young once ; her youth would be contemporary with her master 's : mrs . fairfax told me once , she had lived here many years . i do n't think she can ever have been pretty ; but , for aught i know , she may possess originality and strength of character to compensate for the want of personal advantages .",5

"as he , however , had no other hat , he picked up this as he ran , and arrived at his quarters very pale and quite out of breath . he sat down without saying a word to anybody , and began to reflect .",44
"the light from our apparatus , reflected from the small facets of quartz , shot sparkling rays at every angle , and i seemed to be moving through a diamond , within which the quickly darting rays broke across each other in a thousand flashing coruscations .",6
"indeed , larger blocks of ice soon appeared , their brilliance varying at the whim of the mists . some of these masses displayed green veins , as if scrawled with undulating lines of copper sulfate . others looked like enormous amethysts , letting the light penetrate their insides . the latter reflected the sun 's rays from the thousand facets of their crystals . the former , tinted with a bright limestone sheen , would have supplied enough building material to make a whole marble town .",52
"aramis resumed his pen , reflected a little , and wrote the following lines , which he immediately submitted to the approbation of his friends . "" my dear cousin . """,5
"he had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them . even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bounded it . they must , he reflected , be awaiting him anxiously , for he had been absent nearly five hours . in the gladness of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re - echo to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming . he paused and listened for an answer . none came save his own cry , which clattered up the dreary silent ravines , and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions . again he shouted , even louder than before , and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago . a vague , nameless dread came over him , and he hurried onwards frantically , dropping the precious food in his agitation .",38
""" i know he is a gascon , "" reflected he , "" but he may be one for the cardinal as well as for me .",9
"milady reflected that the more people she had around her the more she would have to work upon , and lord de winter would redouble his watch . besides , the physician might declare the ailment feigned ; and milady , after having lost the first trick , was not willing to lose the second .

"and in truth , the ocean was deserted . not a sail on the horizon . the tips of crespo island had disappeared during the night . the sea , absorbing every color of the prism except its blue rays , reflected the latter in every direction and sported a wonderful indigo tint . the undulating waves regularly took on the appearance of watered silk with wide stripes .",41
