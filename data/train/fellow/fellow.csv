""" i would say , my dear fellow , that you were posing for a character that does n't suit you . all crime is vulgar , just as all vulgarity is crime . it is not in you , dorian , to commit a murder . i am sorry if i hurt your vanity by saying so , but i assure you it is true . crime belongs exclusively to the lower orders . i do n't blame them in the smallest degree . i should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us , simply a method of procuring extraordinary sensations .

""" my dear fellow , "" said lord henry , elevating his eyebrows in surprise , "" i asked you because i thought you might be able to give me an answer . that is all . i was going through the park last sunday , and close by the marble arch there stood a little crowd of shabby - looking people listening to some vulgar street- preacher . as i passed by , i heard the man yelling out that question to his audience . it struck me as being rather dramatic . london is very rich in curious effects of that kind . a wet sunday , an uncouth christian in a mackintosh , a ring of sickly white faces under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas , and a wonderful phrase flung into the air by shrill hysterical lips -- it was really very good in its way , quite a suggestion . i thought of telling the prophet that art had a soul , but that man had not . i am afraid , however , he would not have understood me .

""" about sending you . it 's an ugly business , watson , an ugly dangerous business , and the more i see of it the less i like it . yes , my dear fellow , you may laugh , but i give you my word that i shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in baker street once more .

""" here are your reports , my dear fellow , and very well thumbed , i assure you . i made excellent arrangements , and they are only delayed one day upon their way . i must compliment you exceedingly upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over an extraordinarily difficult case .

""" really , watson , you excel yourself , "" said holmes , pushing back his chair and lighting a cigarette . "" i am bound to say that in all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities . it may be that you are not yourself luminous , but you are a conductor of light . some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it . i confess , my dear fellow , that i am very much in your debt .

"lord henry shrugged his shoulders . "" my dear fellow , as if i cared ! let us go up to the drawing - room . no sherry , thank you , mr . chapman . something has happened to you , dorian . tell me what it is . you are not yourself to - night . ""","('fellow', 'ami', 'amigar')",0,9,0
""" my dear fellow , you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what i tell you . you can tell your friends that we should have been happy to have come with you , but that urgent business required us to be in town . we hope very soon to return to devonshire . will you remember to give them that message ?

"lord henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls from his heavy , opium - tainted cigarette . "" not send it anywhere ? my dear fellow , why ? have you any reason ? what odd chaps you painters are ! you do anything in the world to gain a reputation . as soon as you have one , you seem to want to throw it away . it is silly of you , for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about , and that is not being talked about . a portrait like this would set you far above all the young men in england , and make the old men quite jealous , if old men are ever capable of any emotion .

""" no , my dear fellow , it is at the hour of action that i turn to you for aid . but this is splendid , really unique from some points of view . when you pass bradley 's , would you ask him to send up a pound of the strongest shag tobacco ? thank you . it would be as well if you could make it convenient not to return before evening . then i should be very glad to compare impressions as to this most interesting problem which has been submitted to us this morning .
