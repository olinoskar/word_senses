""" now , allow me to finish what i have to tell you . i 've heard of you , professor aronnax . you , if not your companions , wo n't perhaps complain too much about the stroke of fate that has brought us together . among the books that make up my favorite reading , you 'll find the work you 've published on the great ocean depths . i 've pored over it . you 've taken your studies as far as terrestrial science can go . but you do n't know everything because you have n't seen everything . let me tell you , professor , you wo n't regret the time you spend aboard my vessel . you 're going to voyage through a land of wonders . stunned amazement will probably be your habitual state of mind . it will be a long while before you tire of the sights constantly before your eyes . i 'm going to make another underwater tour of the world-- perhaps my last , who knows?--and i 'll review everything i 've studied in the depths of these seas that i 've crossed so often , and you can be my fellow student . starting this very day , you 'll enter a new element , you 'll see what no human being has ever seen before-- since my men and i no longer count -- and thanks to me , you 're going to learn the ultimate secrets of our planet .

"so the frigate was equipped for a far - off voyage and armed with fearsome fishing gear , but nobody knew where to steer it . and impatience grew until , on june 2 , word came that the tampico , a steamer on the san francisco line sailing from california to shanghai , had sighted the animal again , three weeks before in the northerly seas of the pacific .",10
""" my inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait did not lie , and that this fellow was indeed a baskerville . he was a son of that rodger baskerville , the younger brother of sir charles , who fled with a sinister reputation to south america , where he was said to have died unmarried . he did , as a matter of fact , marry , and had one child , this fellow , whose real name is the same as his father 's . he married beryl garcia , one of the beauties of costa rica , and , having purloined a considerable sum of public money , he changed his name to vandeleur and fled to england , where he established a school in the east of yorkshire . his reason for attempting this special line of business was that he had struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon the voyage home , and that he had used this man 's ability to make the undertaking a success . fraser , the tutor , died however , and the school which had begun well sank from disrepute into infamy . the vandeleurs found it convenient to change their name to stapleton , and he brought the remains of his fortune , his schemes for the future , and his taste for entomology to the south of england . i learned at the british museum that he was a recognized authority upon the subject , and that the name of vandeleur has been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had , in his yorkshire days , been the first to describe .",158
their aerial voyage had lasted five days .,2
"returning a little while after , he told candide that upon second consideration he could not undertake the voyage for less than twenty thousand .",18
"this extraordinary assembly continued sitting till four in the morning . candide , while he was listening to their adventures , called to mind what the old woman had said to him in their voyage to buenos ayres , and the wager she had laid that there was not a person on board the ship but had met with great misfortunes .",34
""" but think it over , because i do n't want to hide anything from you . this is one of those voyages from which people do n't always come back ! """,22
""" i do not say no , "" replied pencroft , who had always the casting vote in maritime questions ; "" i do not say no , although it is not exactly the same thing to make a long as a short voyage !",43
""" well , your honour , "" replied he , "" i could not risk myself , my men , or my little boat of scarcely twenty tons on so long a voyage at this time of year . besides , we could not reach yokohama in time , for it is sixteen hundred and sixty miles from hong kong . """,32
""" the voyage ! """,2
"this voyage of eight hundred miles was a perilous venture on a craft of twenty tons , and at that season of the year . the chinese seas are usually boisterous , subject to terrible gales of wind , and especially during the equinoxes ; and it was now early november .",1
"it would clearly have been to the master 's advantage to carry his passengers to yokohama , since he was paid a certain sum per day ; but he would have been rash to attempt such a voyage , and it was imprudent even to attempt to reach shanghai . but john bunsby believed in the tankadere , which rode on the waves like a seagull ; and perhaps he was not wrong .",37

"cyrus harding was equally anxious to try the vessel , the model of which had originated with him , although on the sailor 's advice he had altered some parts of it , but he did not share pencroft 's confidence in her , and as the latter had not again spoken of the voyage to tabor island , harding hoped he had given it up .",54
"phileas fogg was in the act of finishing the thirty - third rubber of the voyage , and his partner and himself having , by a bold stroke , captured all thirteen of the tricks , concluded this fine campaign with a brilliant victory .",15
"that evil influence which carried me first away from my father ’s house — which hurried me into the wild and indigested notion of raising my fortune , and that impressed those conceits so forcibly upon me as to make me deaf to all good advice , and to the entreaties and even the commands of my father — i say , the same influence , whatever it was , presented the most unfortunate of all enterprises to my view ; and i went on board a vessel bound to the coast of africa ; or , as our sailors vulgarly called it , a voyage to guinea .",105
"this was the only voyage which i may say was successful in all my adventures , which i owe to the integrity and honesty of my friend the captain ; under whom also i got a competent knowledge of the mathematics and the rules of navigation , learned how to keep an account of the ship ’s course , take an observation , and , in short , to understand some things that were needful to be understood by a sailor ; for , as he took delight to instruct me , i took delight to learn ; and , in a word , this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant ; for i brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold - dust for my adventure , which yielded me in london , at my return , almost £ 300 ; and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts which have since so completed my ruin .",105
""" yes , a real boat , "" replied the sailor ; "" but we do not want one for a sea voyage , and in five days at the most , i will undertake to construct a canoe fit to navigate the mercy . """,22
"but i was hurried on , and obeyed blindly the dictates of my fancy rather than my reason ; and , accordingly , the ship being fitted out , and the cargo furnished , and all things done , as by agreement , by my partners in the voyage , i went on board in an evil hour , the 1st september 1659 , being the same day eight years that i went from my father and mother at hull , in order to act the rebel to their authority , and the fool to my own interests .",48
"i was positively against that ; and looking over the charts of the sea - coast of america with him , we concluded there was no inhabited country for us to have recourse to till we came within the circle of the caribbee islands , and therefore resolved to stand away for barbadoes ; which , by keeping off at sea , to avoid the indraft of the bay or gulf of mexico , we might easily perform , as we hoped , in about fifteen days ’ sail ; whereas we could not possibly make our voyage to the coast of africa without some assistance both to our ship and to ourselves .",97
"with this design we changed our course , and steered away n.w . by w. , in order to reach some of our english islands , where i hoped for relief . but our voyage was otherwise determined ; for , being in the latitude of twelve degrees eighteen minutes , a second storm came upon us , which carried us away with the same impetuosity westward , and drove us so out of the way of all human commerce , that , had all our lives been saved as to the sea , we were rather in danger of being devoured by savages than ever returning to our own country .",34
"just as they rose from table , in came four serene highnesses , who had also been stripped of their territories by the fortune of war , and had come to spend the remainder of the carnival at venice . candide took no manner of notice of them ; for his thoughts were wholly employed on his voyage to constantinople , where he intended to go in search of his lovely miss cunegund .",57
"the passage was marked by nothing unusual . i bore the troubles of the sea pretty well ; my uncle , to his own intense disgust , and his greater shame , was ill all through the voyage .",37
"the ' duncan ' yacht was equipped for the distant voyage , in which the nobleman 's family and the captain 's children wished to take part , and the ' duncan , ' leaving glasgow , proceeded towards the atlantic , passed through the straits of magellan , and ascended the pacific as far as patagonia , where , according to a previous interpretation of the document , they supposed that captain grant was a prisoner among the indians .",10
"the train entered the station , and passepartout jumping out first , was followed by mr . fogg , who assisted his fair companion to descend . phileas fogg intended to proceed at once to the hong kong steamer , in order to get aouda comfortably settled for the voyage . he was unwilling to leave her while they were still on dangerous ground .",49
"upon the whole , as i found by all his discourse a settled affection to me , and that nothing could part him from me , so i found all the foundation of his desire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent affection to the people , and his hopes of my doing them good ; a thing which , as i had no notion of myself , so i had not the least thought or intention , or desire of undertaking it . but still i found a strong inclination to attempting my escape , founded on the supposition gathered from the discourse , that there were seventeen bearded men there ; and therefore , without any more delay , i went to work with friday to find out a great tree proper to fell , and make a large periagua , or canoe , to undertake the voyage . there were trees enough in the island to have built a little fleet , not of periaguas or canoes , but even of good , large vessels ; but the main thing i looked at was , to get one so near the water that we might launch it when it was made , to avoid the mistake i committed at first .",153
"when i took leave of this island , i carried on board , for relics , the great goat - skin cap i had made , my umbrella , and one of my parrots ; also , i forgot not to take the money i formerly mentioned , which had lain by me so long useless that it was grown rusty or tarnished , and could hardly pass for silver till it had been a little rubbed and handled , as also the money i found in the wreck of the spanish ship . and thus i left the island , the 19th of december , as i found by the ship ’s account , in the year 1686 , after i had been upon it eight - and - twenty years , two months , and nineteen days ; being delivered from this second captivity the same day of the month that i first made my escape in the long - boat from among the moors of sallee . in this vessel , after a long voyage , i arrived in england the 11th of june , in the year 1687 , having been thirty - five years absent .",177
"what was detective fix , so unluckily drawn on from country to country , doing all this while ? he had managed to embark on the rangoon at calcutta without being seen by passepartout , after leaving orders that , if the warrant should arrive , it should be forwarded to him at hong kong ; and he hoped to conceal his presence to the end of the voyage . it would have been difficult to explain why he was on board without awakening passepartout 's suspicions , who thought him still at bombay . but necessity impelled him , nevertheless , to renew his acquaintance with the worthy servant , as will be seen .",68
"but as beautiful as it was , i could get only a quick look at this basin whose surface area comprises 2,000,000 square kilometers . even captain nemo 's personal insights were denied me , because that mystifying individual did n't appear one single time during our high - speed crossing . i estimate that the nautilus covered a track of some 600 leagues under the waves of this sea , and this voyage was accomplished in just twenty - four hours times two . departing from the waterways of greece on the morning of february 16 , we cleared the strait of gibraltar by sunrise on the 18th .",73
