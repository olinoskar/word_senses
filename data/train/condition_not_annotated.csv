"the question of knowing how , in their condition , they were to act against the pirates , was thoroughly discussed on the 29th of november by cyrus harding , gideon spilett , and pencroft , at a moment when herbert was asleep and could not hear them .",8
"the engineer 's condition would , therefore , have been bad enough , if his companions had not carefully covered him with their coats and waistcoats .",3
"we had long lost sight of the sea shore behind the hills of bones . the rash professor , careless of losing his way , hurried me forward . we advanced in silence , bathed in luminous electric fluid . by some phenomenon which i am unable to explain , it lighted up all sides of every object equally . such was its diffusiveness , there being no central point from which the light emanated , that shadows no longer existed . you might have thought yourself under the rays of a vertical sun in a tropical region at noonday and the height of summer . no vapour was visible . the rocks , the distant mountains , a few isolated clumps of forest trees in the distance , presented a weird and wonderful aspect under these totally new conditions of a universal diffusion of light . we were like hoffmann 's shadowless man .",139
"in the interview which followed between him and mrs . reed , i presume , from after - occurrences , that the apothecary ventured to recommend my being sent to school ; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough adopted ; for as abbot said , in discussing the subject with bessie when both sat sewing in the nursery one night , after i was in bed , and , as they thought , asleep , "" missis was , she dared say , glad enough to get rid of such a tiresome , ill - conditioned child , who always looked as if she were watching everybody , and scheming plots underhand .

"this occurrence , extremely serious in itself , might perhaps have been forgotten like so many others , if three weeks later it had n't been reenacted under identical conditions . only , thanks to the nationality of the ship victimized by this new ramming , and thanks to the reputation of the company to which this ship belonged , the event caused an immense uproar .",29

"even if he knew it by heart , a man in my disturbed , befuddled condition could n't have quoted a syllable of his own country 's history .",15
"the engineer was then informed of all that had passed during the voyage , and under what conditions the search had been conducted ; how the only dwelling in the island had long been abandoned ; how at last a castaway had been captured , who appeared no longer to belong to the human species .",17

"no portion of the masonry had fallen ; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts , and the crumbling condition of the individual stones . in this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old wood - work which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault , with no disturbance from the breath of the external air .",27
"we were finally in the area of the monster 's latest antics ! and in all honesty , shipboard conditions became life - threatening . hearts were pounding hideously , gearing up for futures full of incurable aneurysms . the entire crew suffered from a nervous excitement that it 's beyond me to describe . nobody ate , nobody slept . twenty times a day some error in perception , or the optical illusions of some sailor perched in the crosstrees , would cause intolerable anguish , and this emotion , repeated twenty times over , kept us in a state of irritability so intense that a reaction was bound to follow .",19

"at hearing this , candide fainted away a second time , but , not withstanding , having come to himself again , he said all that it became him to say ; he inquired into the cause and effect , as well as into the sufficing reason that had reduced pangloss to so miserable a condition .",55
"i have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer , with the exception of certain effects of stringed instruments .",7
"this last speech had its effect on candide ; he flew to the charitable anabaptist , james ; he flung himself at his feet , and gave him so striking a picture of the miserable condition of his friend that the good man without any further hesitation agreed to take dr . pangloss into his house , and to pay for his cure .",35
"the notes reminded the men that the children , women , and old men whom they allowed to die were their sons , their wives , and their fathers , and that it would be more just for everyone to be reduced to the common misery , in order that equal conditions should give birth to unanimous resolutions .",51

"it was just at high - water when these people came on shore ; and while they rambled about to see what kind of a place they were in , they had carelessly stayed till the tide was spent , and the water was ebbed considerably away , leaving their boat aground . they had left two men in the boat , who , as i found afterwards , having drunk a little too much brandy , fell asleep ; however , one of them waking a little sooner than the other and finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it , hallooed out for the rest , who were straggling about : upon which they all soon came to the boat : but it was past all their strength to launch her , the boat being very heavy , and the shore on that side being a soft oozy sand , almost like a quicksand . in this condition , like true seamen , who are , perhaps , the least of all mankind given to forethought , they gave it over , and away they strolled about the country again ; and i heard one of them say aloud to another , calling them off from the boat , “ why , let her alone , jack , ca n’t you ? she ’ll float next tide ; ” by which i was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of what countrymen they were .",162

"while he took his sights with his sextant , one of the nautilus 's sailors-- that muscular man who had gone with us to crespo island during our first underwater excursion -- came up to clean the glass panes of the beacon . i then examined the fittings of this mechanism , whose power was increased a hundredfold by biconvex lenses that were designed like those in a lighthouse and kept its rays productively focused . this electric lamp was so constructed as to yield its maximum illuminating power . in essence , its light was generated in a vacuum , insuring both its steadiness and intensity . such a vacuum also reduced wear on the graphite points between which the luminous arc expanded . this was an important savings for captain nemo , who could n't easily renew them . but under these conditions , wear and tear were almost nonexistent .",144

"on january 25 , the ocean being completely deserted , the nautilus spent the day on the surface , churning the waves with its powerful propeller and making them spurt to great heights . under these conditions , who would n't have mistaken it for a gigantic cetacean ? i spent three - quarters of the day on the platform . i stared at the sea . nothing on the horizon , except near four o'clock in the afternoon a long steamer to the west , running on our opposite tack . its masting was visible for an instant , but it could n't have seen the nautilus because we were lying too low in the water . i imagine that steamboat belonged to the peninsular & oriental line , which provides service from the island of ceylon to sidney , also calling at king george sound and melbourne .",36
