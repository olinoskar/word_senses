"i stayed in my stateroom . i wanted to avoid the captain , to hide from his eyes the agitation overwhelming me . what an agonizing day i spent , torn between my desire to regain my free will and my regret at abandoning this marvelous nautilus , leaving my underwater research incomplete ! how could i relinquish this ocean--""my own atlantic , "" as i liked to call it -- without observing its lower strata , without wresting from it the kinds of secrets that had been revealed to me by the seas of the east indies and the pacific ! i was putting down my novel half read , i was waking up as my dream neared its climax ! how painfully the hours passed , as i sometimes envisioned myself safe on shore with my companions , or , despite my better judgment , as i sometimes wished that some unforeseen circumstances would prevent ned land from carrying out his plans .",163
"by nine o'clock we had pulled up to shore . the sky was growing brighter . clouds were fleeing to the south . mists were rising from the cold surface of the water . captain nemo headed toward the peak , which he no doubt planned to make his observatory . it was an arduous climb over sharp lava and pumice stones in the midst of air often reeking with sulfurous fumes from the smoke holes . for a man out of practice at treading land , the captain scaled the steepest slopes with a supple agility i could n't equal , and which would have been envied by hunters of pyrenees mountain goats .",45
face to face with lord de winter her plan of conduct was more easy . she had laid that down the preceding evening .,8
"as usual , dinner was served me in my stateroom . full of anxiety , i ate little . i left the table at seven o'clock . 120 minutes-- i was keeping track of them -- still separated me from the moment i was to rejoin ned land . my agitation increased . my pulse was throbbing violently . i could n't stand still . i walked up and down , hoping to calm my troubled mind with movement . the possibility of perishing in our reckless undertaking was the least of my worries ; my heart was pounding at the thought that our plans might be discovered before we had left the nautilus , at the thought of being hauled in front of captain nemo and finding him angered , or worse , saddened by my deserting him .",104
"while mary drew , diana pursued a course of encyclopaedic reading she had ( to my awe and amazement ) undertaken , and i fagged away at german , he pondered a mystic lore of his own : that of some eastern tongue , the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his plans .",53
""" it is possible that stapleton did not know of the existence of an heir in canada . in any case he would very soon learn it from his friend dr . mortimer , and he was told by the latter all details about the arrival of henry baskerville . stapleton 's first idea was that this young stranger from canada might possibly be done to death in london without coming down to devonshire at all . he distrusted his wife ever since she had refused to help him in laying a trap for the old man , and he dared not leave her long out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her . it was for this reason that he took her to london with him . they lodged , i find , at the mexborough private hotel , in craven street , which was actually one of those called upon by my agent in search of evidence . here he kept his wife imprisoned in her room while he , disguised in a beard , followed dr . mortimer to baker street and afterwards to the station and to the northumberland hotel . his wife had some inkling of his plans ; but she had such a fear of her husband -- a fear founded upon brutal ill - treatment -- that she dare not write to warn the man whom she knew to be in danger . if the letter should fall into stapleton 's hands her own life would not be safe . eventually , as we know , she adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would form the message , and addressing the letter in a disguised hand . it reached the baronet , and gave him the first warning of his danger .",207

"that day , the sixth of our imprisonment , captain nemo concluded that picks and mattocks were too slow to deal with the ice layer still separating us from open water -- and he decided to crush this layer . the man had kept his energy and composure . he had subdued physical pain with moral strength . he could still think , plan , and act .",63
"there , to his great astonishment , d’artagnan heard the policy which made all europe tremble criticized aloud and openly , as well as the private life of the cardinal , which so many great nobles had been punished for trying to pry into . that great man who was so revered by d’artagnan the elder served as an object of ridicule to the musketeers of treville , who cracked their jokes upon his bandy legs and his crooked back . some sang ballads about mme . d’aguillon , his mistress , and mme . cambalet , his niece ; while others formed parties and plans to annoy the pages and guards of the cardinal duke -- all things which appeared to d’artagnan monstrous impossibilities .",105

"we were thoroughly satisfied with the results of our hunting . a gleeful ned proposed that we return the next day to this magic island , which he planned to depopulate of its every edible quadruped . but he was reckoning without events .",28
"so ned land had good reason to worry . in these wide seas empty of islands , it was no longer feasible to jump ship . nor did we have any way to counter captain nemo 's whims . we had no choice but to acquiesce ; but if we could n't attain our end through force or cunning , i liked to think we might achieve it through persuasion . once this voyage was over , might not captain nemo consent to set us free in return for our promise never to reveal his existence ? our word of honor , which we sincerely would have kept . however , this delicate question would have to be negotiated with the captain . but how would he receive our demands for freedom ? at the very outset and in no uncertain terms , had n't he declared that the secret of his life required that we be permanently imprisoned on board the nautilus ? would n't he see my four - month silence as a tacit acceptance of this situation ? would my returning to this subject arouse suspicions that could jeopardize our escape plans , if we had promising circumstances for trying again later on ? i weighed all these considerations , turned them over in my mind , submitted them to conseil , but he was as baffled as i was . in short , although i 'm not easily discouraged , i realized that my chances of ever seeing my fellow men again were shrinking by the day , especially at a time when captain nemo was recklessly racing toward the south atlantic !",194
""" your eminence is right , "" replied milady ; "" and i have been wrong in seeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which it really is -- that is , to announce to his grace , on the part of your eminence , that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fete given by madame the constable ; that you have proofs of the interview granted at the louvre by the queen to a certain italian astrologer who was no other than the duke of buckingham ; that you have ordered a little romance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of amiens , with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took place , and portraits of the actors who figured in them ; that montague is in the bastille , and that the torture may make him say things he remembers , and even things he has forgotten ; that you possess a certain letter from madame de chevreuse , found in his grace ’s lodging , which singularly compromises not only her who wrote it , but her in whose name it was written .",128

"to take spies and hang them , to make hazardous expeditions upon the dyke or the sea , to imagine wild plans , and to execute them coolly -- such were the pastimes which made the army find these days short which were not only so long to the rochellais , a prey to famine and anxiety , but even to the cardinal , who blockaded them so closely .",21

"so i begged ned to let me think about it before taking action . if this measure proved fruitless , it could arouse the captain 's suspicions , make our circumstances even more arduous , and jeopardize the canadian 's plans . i might add that i could hardly use our state of health as an argument . except for that grueling ordeal under the ice bank at the south pole , we had never felt better , neither ned , conseil , nor i. the nutritious food , life - giving air , regular routine , and uniform temperature kept illness at bay ; and for a man who did n't miss his past existence on land , for a captain nemo who was at home here , who went where he wished , who took paths mysterious to others if not himself in attaining his ends , i could understand such a life . but we ourselves had n't severed all ties with humanity . for my part , i did n't want my new and unusual research to be buried with my bones . i had now earned the right to pen the definitive book on the sea , and sooner or later i wanted that book to see the light of day .",40
"there was a full complement of passengers on board , among them english , many americans , a large number of coolies on their way to california , and several east indian officers , who were spending their vacation in making the tour of the world . nothing of moment happened on the voyage ; the steamer , sustained on its large paddles , rolled but little , and the pacific almost justified its name . mr . fogg was as calm and taciturn as ever . his young companion felt herself more and more attached to him by other ties than gratitude ; his silent but generous nature impressed her more than she thought ; and it was almost unconsciously that she yielded to emotions which did not seem to have the least effect upon her protector . aouda took the keenest interest in his plans , and became impatient at any incident which seemed likely to retard his journey .",146
