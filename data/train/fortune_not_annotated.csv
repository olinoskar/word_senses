""" my inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait did not lie , and that this fellow was indeed a baskerville . he was a son of that rodger baskerville , the younger brother of sir charles , who fled with a sinister reputation to south america , where he was said to have died unmarried . he did , as a matter of fact , marry , and had one child , this fellow , whose real name is the same as his father 's . he married beryl garcia , one of the beauties of costa rica , and , having purloined a considerable sum of public money , he changed his name to vandeleur and fled to england , where he established a school in the east of yorkshire . his reason for attempting this special line of business was that he had struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon the voyage home , and that he had used this man 's ability to make the undertaking a success . fraser , the tutor , died however , and the school which had begun well sank from disrepute into infamy . the vandeleurs found it convenient to change their name to stapleton , and he brought the remains of his fortune , his schemes for the future , and his taste for entomology to the south of england . i learned at the british museum that he was a recognized authority upon the subject , and that the name of vandeleur has been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had , in his yorkshire days , been the first to describe .",217

"all on board feared that it could not be done , and every one -- phileas fogg , no doubt , excepted -- felt his heart beat with impatience . the boat must keep up an average of nine miles an hour , and the wind was becoming calmer every moment ! it was a capricious breeze , coming from the coast , and after it passed the sea became smooth . still , the tankadere was so light , and her fine sails caught the fickle zephyrs so well , that , with the aid of the currents john bunsby found himself at six o'clock not more than ten miles from the mouth of shanghai river . shanghai itself is situated at least twelve miles up the stream . at seven they were still three miles from shanghai . the pilot swore an angry oath ; the reward of two hundred pounds was evidently on the point of escaping him . he looked at mr . fogg . mr . fogg was perfectly tranquil ; and yet his whole fortune was at this moment at stake .",180

"the two castaways , john ferrier and the little girl who had shared his fortunes and had been adopted as his daughter , accompanied the mormons to the end of their great pilgrimage . little lucy ferrier was borne along pleasantly enough in elder stangerson 's waggon , a retreat which she shared with the mormon 's three wives and with his son , a headstrong forward boy of twelve . having rallied , with the elasticity of childhood , from the shock caused by her mother 's death , she soon became a pet with the women , and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving canvas - covered home . in the meantime ferrier having recovered from his privations , distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable hunter . so rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions , that when they reached the end of their wanderings , it was unanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers , with the exception of young himself , and of stangerson , kemball , johnston , and drebber , who were the four principal elders .",14

"the lights inside the house had all been extinguished , and from the darkened window ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own , and which he was now about to abandon for ever . he had long nerved himself to the sacrifice , however , and the thought of the honour and happiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes . all looked so peaceful and happy , the rustling trees and the broad silent stretch of grain - land , that it was difficult to realize that the spirit of murder lurked through it all . yet the white face and set expression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head .",65
