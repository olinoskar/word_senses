"not that i ever suffered much from them ; i took care to turn the tables . what tricks theodore and i used to play on our miss wilsons , and mrs . greys , and madame jouberts ! mary was always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit .",36
"the best fun was with madame joubert : miss wilson was a poor sickly thing , lachrymose and low- spirited , not worth the trouble of vanquishing , in short ; and mrs . grey was coarse and insensible ; no blow took effect on her .",5
"it however likewise appeared that the soldier on duty -- a zealous catholic , no doubt -- shook off the charm , for through the door he called : "" hold your tongue , madame !",34
"madame tussaud 's "" people , "" let it be said , are of wax , and are much visited in london ; speech is all that is wanting to make them human .",0
""" then , madame , "" said the abbess , smiling , "" be reassured ; the house in which you are shall not be a very hard prison , and we will do all in our power to make you cherish your captivity .",3
"i examined , too , in thought , the possibility of my ever being able to translate currently a certain little french story which madame pierrot had that day shown me ; nor was that problem solved to my satisfaction ere i fell sweetly asleep .",24
""" madame bonacieux ! ah , that ’s true ! "" said athos . "" my poor friend , i had forgotten you were in love . """,1
""" be kind enough , then , madame , to act more compliantly . """,7
""" the answer to madame ’s , "" replied kitty , all in a tremble .",4
"the procurator repeated several times , "" ah , madame coquenard !",9
""" thanks , madame ! "" said porthos , "" but i do n’t like to abuse your kindness ; besides , i must think of my outfit ! """,3
""" you hear , madame , "" said the king , who enjoyed the embarrassment to its full extent , but without guessing the cause . "" you hear , madame ? """,30
""" you , madame ! "" said d’artagnan , affecting surprise ; "" is that possible , my god?--good and beautiful as you are ! """,3
""" ah , madame ! "" said porthos , haughtily ; "" do you take me for a beggar ? """,3
""" ' god forgive you ! ' cried madame charpentier , throwing up her hands and sinking back in her chair . ' you have murdered your brother . '",8
"is it not so , madame ? """,5
""" what is that , madame ? """,5
""" i think nothing ; i quote a fact , that is all . only i say that if i were named madame de montpensier , or the queen marie de medicis , i should use less precautions than i take , being simply called milady clarik . """,22
"how different it was with material things ! where had they passed to ? where was the great crocus - coloured robe , on which the gods fought against the giants , that had been worked by brown girls for the pleasure of athena ? where the huge velarium that nero had stretched across the colosseum at rome , that titan sail of purple on which was represented the starry sky , and apollo driving a chariot drawn by white , gilt - reined steeds ? he longed to see the curious table - napkins wrought for the priest of the sun , on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast ; the mortuary cloth of king chilperic , with its three hundred golden bees ; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the bishop of pontus and were figured with "" lions , panthers , bears , dogs , forests , rocks , hunters -- all , in fact , that a painter can copy from nature "" ; and the coat that charles of orleans once wore , on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning "" madame , je suis tout joyeux , "" the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread , and each note , of square shape in those days , formed with four pearls .",203
""" your eminence is right , "" replied milady ; "" and i have been wrong in seeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which it really is -- that is , to announce to his grace , on the part of your eminence , that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fete given by madame the constable ; that you have proofs of the interview granted at the louvre by the queen to a certain italian astrologer who was no other than the duke of buckingham ; that you have ordered a little romance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of amiens , with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took place , and portraits of the actors who figured in them ; that montague is in the bastille , and that the torture may make him say things he remembers , and even things he has forgotten ; that you possess a certain letter from madame de chevreuse , found in his grace ’s lodging , which singularly compromises not only her who wrote it , but her in whose name it was written .",182
""" my god ! madame , you are deceived , "" said porthos ; "" she is simply a duchess . """,4
""" why did not madame de lannoy come and inform you instantly ? """,4
""" does madame de lannoy know what was in that casket ? """,2
""" more intrigues ! nothing but intrigues ! thank you , madame , i am aware of them now ; monsieur cardinal has enlightened me on that head . """,11
""" monseigneur , "" said athos , with a calmness the more terrible because he risked his head in making this reply , "" the letter is a woman ’s letter , but it is neither signed marion de lorme , nor madame d’aiguillon . """,42

""" with madame frederic and her husband : she took care of me , but she is nothing related to me .",2
""" miss scatcherd is hasty -- you must take care not to offend her ; madame pierrot is not a bad sort of person . """,15
""" dear lady narborough , "" murmured dorian , smiling , "" i have not been in love for a whole week -- not , in fact , since madame de ferrol left town . """,29
""" i hope so , "" said his hostess , laughing . "" but really , if you all worship madame de ferrol in this ridiculous way , i shall have to marry again so as to be in the fashion . """,20
