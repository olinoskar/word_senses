"in certain parts of the cone there were glaciers . here hans advanced only with extreme precaution , sounding his way with his iron - pointed pole , to discover any crevasses in it . at particularly dubious passages we were obliged to connect ourselves with each other by a long cord , in order that any man who missed his footing might be held up by his companions . this solid formation was prudent , but did not remove all danger .",26
"they ran with pick - axes and iron - tipped poles in their hands , passed over the mercy bridge , descended the right bank of the river , along the beach , and in less than twenty minutes the settlers were close to the enormous animal , above which flocks of birds already hovered .",10
"under these conditions the barometer generally stayed quite low . it fell as far as 73.5 centimeters . our compass indications no longer offered any guarantees . the deranged needles would mark contradictory directions as we approached the southern magnetic pole , which does n't coincide with the south pole proper . in fact , according to the astronomer hansteen , this magnetic pole is located fairly close to latitude 70 degrees and longitude 130 degrees , or abiding by the observations of louis - isidore duperrey , in longitude 135 degrees and latitude 70 degrees 30 ' . hence we had to transport compasses to different parts of the ship , take many readings , and strike an average . often we could chart our course only by guesswork , a less than satisfactory method in the midst of these winding passageways whose landmarks change continuously .",40

"forty - eight hours after , coming out of a storm which forced the schooner to scud under bare poles , we sighted east of us the beacon on cape skagen , where dangerous rocks extend far away seaward . an icelandic pilot came on board , and in three hours the _ valkyria _ dropped her anchor before rejkiavik , in faxa bay .",19
"it is useless to describe the astonishing performances of the acrobats and gymnasts . the turning on ladders , poles , balls , barrels , & c. , was executed with wonderful precision . but the principal attraction was the exhibition of the long noses , a show to which europe is as yet a stranger .",19
"conseil was in dead earnest , but i did n't subscribe to his views . however , the situation had changed in only a short time and we had n't noticed . now some twenty dugout canoes were surrounding the nautilus . hollowed from tree trunks , these dugouts were long , narrow , and well designed for speed , keeping their balance by means of two bamboo poles that floated on the surface of the water . they were maneuvered by skillful , half - naked paddlers , and i viewed their advance with definite alarm .",68
"boats were often seen passing under the windows of the farm laden with effendis , bashaws , and cadis , that were going into banishment to lemnos , mytilene and erzerum . and other cadis , bashaws , and effendis were seen coming back to succeed the place of the exiles , and were driven out in their turns . they saw several heads curiously stuck upon poles , and carried as presents to the sublime porte .",67
""" see , its poles are reversed ! """,4
""" see there , "" he cried , as soon as he was able to speak . "" after our arrival at cape saknussemm the north pole of the needle of this confounded compass began to point south instead of north . """,26
""" during the electric storm on the liedenbrock sea , that ball of fire , which magnetised all the iron on board , reversed the poles of our magnet ! """,25
"the breeze subsided a little towards noon , and set in from the south - west . the pilot put up his poles , but took them down again within two hours , as the wind freshened up anew .",22
"he took care also to observe the moment when it passed the meridian below the pole , which would simplify the operation .",15
"during the night camp walbach was passed on the left ; lodge pole creek ran parallel with the road , marking the boundary between the territories of wyoming and colorado . they entered nebraska at eleven , passed near sedgwick , and touched at julesburg , on the southern branch of the platte river .",12
"this vegetable cable was fastened to the after - part of the raft , and the sailor held it in his hand while herbert , pushing off the raft with a long pole , kept it in the current .",32
"the nets were hauled on board . they were a breed of trawl resembling those used off the normandy coast , huge pouches held half open by a floating pole and a chain laced through the lower meshes . trailing in this way from these iron glove makers , the resulting receptacles scoured the ocean floor and collected every marine exhibit in their path . that day they gathered up some unusual specimens from these fish - filled waterways : anglerfish whose comical movements qualify them for the epithet "" clowns , "" black commerson anglers equipped with their antennas , undulating triggerfish encircled by little red bands , bloated puffers whose venom is extremely insidious , some olive - hued lampreys , snipefish covered with silver scales , cutlass fish whose electrocuting power equals that of the electric eel and the electric ray , scaly featherbacks with brown crosswise bands , greenish codfish , several varieties of goby , etc . ; finally , some fish of larger proportions : a one - meter jack with a prominent head , several fine bonito from the genus scomber decked out in the colors blue and silver , and three magnificent tuna whose high speeds could n't save them from our trawl .",29
"from that day forward , who knows where the nautilus took us in the north atlantic basin ? always at incalculable speed ! always amid the high arctic mists ! did it call at the capes of spitzbergen or the shores of novaya zemlya ? did it visit such uncharted seas as the white sea , the kara sea , the gulf of ob , the lyakhov islands , or those unknown beaches on the siberian coast ? i 'm unable to say . i lost track of the passing hours . time was in abeyance on the ship 's clocks . as happens in the polar regions , it seemed that night and day no longer followed their normal sequence . i felt myself being drawn into that strange domain where the overwrought imagination of edgar allan poe was at home . like his fabled arthur gordon pym , i expected any moment to see that "" shrouded human figure , very far larger in its proportions than any dweller among men , "" thrown across the cataract that protects the outskirts of the pole !",185
"_ note_.â€”during all this time i worked to make this room or cave spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse or magazine , a kitchen , a dining - room , and a cellar . as for my lodging , i kept to the tent ; except that sometimes , in the wet season of the year , it rained so hard that i could not keep myself dry , which caused me afterwards to cover all my place within my pale with long poles , in the form of rafters , leaning against the rock , and load them with flags and large leaves of trees , like a thatch .",85
"yes : our compass was no longer a guide ; the needle flew from pole to pole with a kind of frenzied impulse ; it ran round the dial , and spun hither and thither as if it were giddy or intoxicated .",16
"in an hour we had reached the islet . two hours later we had completed a full circle around it . it measured four to five miles in circumference . a narrow channel separated it from a considerable shore , perhaps a continent whose limits we could n't see . the existence of this shore seemed to bear out commander maury 's hypotheses . in essence , this ingenious american has noted that between the south pole and the 60th parallel , the sea is covered with floating ice of dimensions much greater than any found in the north atlantic . from this fact he drew the conclusion that the antarctic circle must contain considerable shores , since icebergs ca n't form on the high seas but only along coastlines . according to his calculations , this frozen mass enclosing the southernmost pole forms a vast ice cap whose width must reach 4,000 kilometers .",142
"after our position fix , the nautilus 's latitude bearings were modulated to the southwest . our prow pointed to the indian ocean . where would captain nemo 's fancies take us ? would he head up to the shores of asia ? would he pull nearer to the beaches of europe ? unlikely choices for a man who avoided populated areas ! so would he go down south ? would he double the cape of good hope , then cape horn , and push on to the antarctic pole ? finally , would he return to the seas of the pacific , where his nautilus could navigate freely and easily ? time would tell .",89
"it was an insane idea . fortunately i controlled myself and stretched out on the bed to soothe my bodily agitation . my nerves calmed a little , but with my brain so aroused , i did a swift review of my whole existence aboard the nautilus , every pleasant or unpleasant incident that had crossed my path since i went overboard from the abraham lincoln : the underwater hunting trip , the torres strait , our running aground , the savages of papua , the coral cemetery , the suez passageway , the island of santorini , the cretan diver , the bay of vigo , atlantis , the ice bank , the south pole , our imprisonment in the ice , the battle with the devilfish , the storm in the gulf stream , the avenger , and that horrible scene of the vessel sinking with its crew . . . ! all these events passed before my eyes like backdrops unrolling upstage in a theater . in this strange setting captain nemo then grew fantastically . his features were accentuated , taking on superhuman proportions . he was no longer my equal , he was the man of the waters , the spirit of the seas .",115
""" would you then conclude , "" i said , "" that the magnetic pole is somewhere between the surface of the globe and the point where we are ? """,14
"he motioned to me to look . an exclamation of astonishment burst from me . the north pole of the needle was turned to what we supposed to be the south . it pointed to the shore instead of to the open sea ! i shook the box , examined it again , it was in perfect condition . in whatever position i placed the box the needle pertinaciously returned to this unexpected quarter . therefore there seemed no reason to doubt that during the storm there had been a sudden change of wind unperceived by us , which had brought our raft back to the shore which we thought we had left so long a distance behind us .",17
