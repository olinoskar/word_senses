""" well , it was evident from what we have heard that baskerville has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in town . how else could it be known so quickly that it was the northumberland hotel which he had chosen ? if they had followed him the first day i argued that they would follow him also the second . you may have observed that i twice strolled over to the window while dr . mortimer was reading his legend .

"sherlock holmes had , in a very remarkable degree , the power of detaching his mind at will . for two hours the strange business in which we had been involved appeared to be forgotten , and he was entirely absorbed in the pictures of the modern belgian masters . he would talk of nothing but art , of which he had the crudest ideas , from our leaving the gallery until we found ourselves at the northumberland hotel .",78

""" the man was seen , "" continued lestrade . "" a milk boy , passing on his way to the dairy , happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel . he noticed that a ladder , which usually lay there , was raised against one of the windows of the second floor , which was wide open . after passing , he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder . he came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel . he took no particular notice of him , beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him to be at work . he has an impression that the man was tall , had a reddish face , and was dressed in a long , brownish coat . he must have stayed in the room some little time after the murder , for we found blood - stained water in the basin , where he had washed his hands , and marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife .
