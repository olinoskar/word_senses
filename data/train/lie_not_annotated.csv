"we did n't leave these patagonian waterways until april 3 , sometimes cruising under the ocean , sometimes on its surface . the nautilus passed the wide estuary formed by the mouth of the rio de la plata , and on april 4 we lay abreast of uruguay , albeit fifty miles out . keeping to its northerly heading , it followed the long windings of south america . by then we had fared 16,000 leagues since coming on board in the seas of japan .",44

"the sixth day of our being at sea we came into yarmouth roads ; the wind having been contrary and the weather calm , we had made but little way since the storm . here we were obliged to come to an anchor , and here we lay , the wind continuing contrary — viz . at south - west — for seven or eight days , during which time a great many ships from newcastle came into the same roads , as the common harbour where the ships might wait for a wind for the river .",47

"after about two years , an odd circumstance presented itself , which put the old thought of making some attempt for my liberty again in my head . my patron lying at home longer than usual without fitting out his ship , which , as i heard , was for want of money , he used constantly , once or twice a week , sometimes oftener if the weather was fair , to take the ship ’s pinnace and go out into the road a - fishing ; and as he always took me and young maresco with him to row the boat , we made him very merry , and i proved very dexterous in catching fish ; insomuch that sometimes he would send me with a moor , one of his kinsmen , and the youth — the maresco , as they called him — to catch a dish of fish for him .",30

"about four o’clock in the evening , being then within a league of the island , i found the point of the rocks which occasioned this disaster stretching out , as is described before , to the southward , and casting off the current more southerly , had , of course , made another eddy to the north ; and this i found very strong , but not directly setting the way my course lay , which was due west , but almost full north . however , having a fresh gale , i stretched across this eddy , slanting north - west ; and in about an hour came within about a mile of the shore , where , it being smooth water , i soon got to land .",74

"when this was done , and all safe upon deck , the captain ordered the mate , with three men , to break into the round - house , where the new rebel captain lay , who , having taken the alarm , had got up , and with two men and a boy had got firearms in their hands ; and when the mate , with a crow , split open the door , the new captain and his men fired boldly among them , and wounded the mate with a musket ball , which broke his arm , and wounded two more of the men , but killed nobody . the mate , calling for help , rushed , however , into the round - house , wounded as he was , and , with his pistol , shot the new captain through the head , the bullet entering at his mouth , and came out again behind one of his ears , so that he never spoke a word more : upon which the rest yielded , and the ship was taken effectually , without any more lives lost .",34
"some time after this , the boat was ordered on shore , the tide being up , with the things promised to the men ; to which the captain , at my intercession , caused their chests and clothes to be added , which they took , and were very thankful for . i also encouraged them , by telling them that if it lay in my power to send any vessel to take them in , i would not forget them .",64
