"phileas fogg gazed at the tempestuous sea , which seemed to be struggling especially to delay him , with his habitual tranquillity . he never changed countenance for an instant , though a delay of twenty hours , by making him too late for the yokohama boat , would almost inevitably cause the loss of the wager . but this man of nerve manifested neither impatience nor annoyance ; it seemed as if the storm were a part of his programme , and had been foreseen . aouda was amazed to find him as calm as he had been from the first time she saw him .",25

"then i began to wonder if this eccentric individual was even on board . since that night when the skiff had left the nautilus on some mysterious mission , my ideas about him had subtly changed . in spite of everything , i thought that captain nemo must have kept up some type of relationship with the shore . did he himself never leave the nautilus ? whole weeks had often gone by without my encountering him . what was he doing all the while ? during all those times i 'd thought he was convalescing in the grip of some misanthropic fit , was he instead far away from the ship , involved in some secret activity whose nature still eluded me ?",35

"at an elevation of about thirty meters , the nature of the terrain changed without becoming any easier . pudding stones and trachyte gave way to black basaltic rock : here , lying in slabs all swollen with blisters ; there , shaped like actual prisms and arranged into a series of columns that supported the springings of this immense vault , a wonderful sample of natural architecture . then , among this basaltic rock , there snaked long , hardened lava flows inlaid with veins of bituminous coal and in places covered by wide carpets of sulfur . the sunshine coming through the crater had grown stronger , shedding a hazy light over all the volcanic waste forever buried in the heart of this extinct mountain .",13

"the san francisco steamer was announced to leave that very evening , and it became necessary to find passepartout , if possible , without delay . mr . fogg applied in vain to the french and english consuls , and , after wandering through the streets a long time , began to despair of finding his missing servant . chance , or perhaps a kind of presentiment , at last led him into the honourable mr . batulcar 's theatre . he certainly would not have recognised passepartout in the eccentric mountebank 's costume ; but the latter , lying on his back , perceived his master in the gallery . he could not help starting , which so changed the position of his nose as to bring the "" pyramid "" pell - mell upon the stage .",119
"passepartout did not change countenance on hearing this name . he thought that the time had not yet arrived to divulge to his master what had taken place between the detective and himself ; and , in the account he gave of his absence , he simply excused himself for having been overtaken by drunkenness , in smoking opium at a tavern in hong kong .",3
"passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie . up to his arrival at bombay , he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there ; but , now that they were plainly whirling across india at full speed , a sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams . his old vagabond nature returned to him ; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took possession of him . he came to regard his master 's project as intended in good earnest , believed in the reality of the bet , and therefore in the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail within the designated period . already he began to worry about possible delays , and accidents which might happen on the way . he recognised himself as being personally interested in the wager , and trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable folly of the night before . being much less cool - headed than mr . fogg , he was much more restless , counting and recounting the days passed over , uttering maledictions when the train stopped , and accusing it of sluggishness , and mentally blaming mr . fogg for not having bribed the engineer . the worthy fellow was ignorant that , while it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer , it could not be done on the railway .",42
"the steamer which was about to depart from yokohama to san francisco belonged to the pacific mail steamship company , and was named the general grant . she was a large paddle - wheel steamer of two thousand five hundred tons ; well equipped and very fast . the massive walking - beam rose and fell above the deck ; at one end a piston - rod worked up and down ; and at the other was a connecting - rod which , in changing the rectilinear motion to a circular one , was directly connected with the shaft of the paddles . the general grant was rigged with three masts , giving a large capacity for sails , and thus materially aiding the steam power . by making twelve miles an hour , she would cross the ocean in twenty - one days . phileas fogg was therefore justified in hoping that he would reach san francisco by the 2nd of december , new york by the 11th , and london on the 20th -- thus gaining several hours on the fatal date of the 21st of december .",84

"it happened also , on the 23rd of november , that passepartout made a joyful discovery . it will be remembered that the obstinate fellow had insisted on keeping his famous family watch at london time , and on regarding that of the countries he had passed through as quite false and unreliable . now , on this day , though he had not changed the hands , he found that his watch exactly agreed with the ship 's chronometers . his triumph was hilarious . he would have liked to know what fix would say if he were aboard !",64

"i was in some degree settled in my measures for carrying on the plantation before my kind friend , the captain of the ship that took me up at sea , went back — for the ship remained there , in providing his lading and preparing for his voyage , nearly three months — when telling him what little stock i had left behind me in london , he gave me this friendly and sincere advice:—“seignior inglese , ” says he ( for so he always called me ) , “ if you will give me letters , and a procuration in form to me , with orders to the person who has your money in london to send your effects to lisbon , to such persons as i shall direct , and in such goods as are proper for this country , i will bring you the produce of them , god willing , at my return ; but , since human affairs are all subject to changes and disasters , i would have you give orders but for one hundred pounds sterling , which , you say , is half your stock , and let the hazard be run for the first ; so that , if it come safe , you may order the rest the same way , and , if it miscarry , you may have the other half to have recourse to for your supply . ”",168
"with this design we changed our course , and steered away n.w . by w. , in order to reach some of our english islands , where i hoped for relief . but our voyage was otherwise determined ; for , being in the latitude of twelve degrees eighteen minutes , a second storm came upon us , which carried us away with the same impetuosity westward , and drove us so out of the way of all human commerce , that , had all our lives been saved as to the sea , we were rather in danger of being devoured by savages than ever returning to our own country .",4

""" the circumstances connected with the death of sir charles can not be said to have been entirely cleared up by the inquest , but at least enough has been done to dispose of those rumours to which local superstition has given rise . there is no reason whatever to suspect foul play , or to imagine that death could be from any but natural causes . sir charles was a widower , and a man who may be said to have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind . in spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his personal tastes , and his indoor servants at baskerville hall consisted of a married couple named barrymore , the husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper . their evidence , corroborated by that of several friends , tends to show that sir charles 's health has for some time been impaired , and points especially to some affection of the heart , manifesting itself in changes of colour , breathlessness , and acute attacks of nervous depression . dr . james mortimer , the friend and medical attendant of the deceased , has given evidence to the same effect .",171
"and in all honesty , i confess that this venturesome excursion was far from displeasing to me . i ca n't express the intensity of my amazement at the beauties of these new regions . the ice struck superb poses . here , its general effect suggested an oriental town with countless minarets and mosques . there , a city in ruins , flung to the ground by convulsions in the earth . these views were varied continuously by the sun 's oblique rays , or were completely swallowed up by gray mists in the middle of blizzards . then explosions , cave - ins , and great iceberg somersaults would occur all around us , altering the scenery like the changing landscape in a diorama .",121
"under these conditions the barometer generally stayed quite low . it fell as far as 73.5 centimeters . our compass indications no longer offered any guarantees . the deranged needles would mark contradictory directions as we approached the southern magnetic pole , which does n't coincide with the south pole proper . in fact , according to the astronomer hansteen , this magnetic pole is located fairly close to latitude 70 degrees and longitude 130 degrees , or abiding by the observations of louis - isidore duperrey , in longitude 135 degrees and latitude 70 degrees 30 ' . hence we had to transport compasses to different parts of the ship , take many readings , and strike an average . often we could chart our course only by guesswork , a less than satisfactory method in the midst of these winding passageways whose landmarks change continuously .",145
"half an hour had already gone by without our situation changing , when our eyes were suddenly spirited from utter darkness into blinding light . our prison lit up all at once ; in other words , it filled with luminescent matter so intense that at first i could n't stand the brightness of it . from its glare and whiteness , i recognized the electric glow that had played around this underwater boat like some magnificent phosphorescent phenomenon . after involuntarily closing my eyes , i reopened them and saw that this luminous force came from a frosted half globe curving out of the cabin 's ceiling .",10
