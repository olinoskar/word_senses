"i could not unlove him , because i felt sure he would soon marry this very lady -- because i read daily in her a proud security in his intentions respecting her -- because i witnessed hourly in him a style of courtship which , if careless and choosing rather to be sought than to seek , was yet , in its very carelessness , captivating , and in its very pride , irresistible .",30
