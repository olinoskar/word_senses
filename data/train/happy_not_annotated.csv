"lastly , she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would , in the after - time , be herself a grown woman ; and how she would keep , through all her riper years , the simple and loving heart of her childhood : and how she would gather about her other little children , and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale , perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago : and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows , and find a pleasure in all their simple joys , remembering her own child - life , and the happy summer days .",113
