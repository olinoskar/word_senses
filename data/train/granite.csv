"as fast as we descended , the succession of beds forming the primitive foundation came out with increasing distinctness . geologists consider this primitive matter to be the base of the mineral crust of the earth , and have ascertained it to be composed of three different formations , schist , gneiss , and mica schist , resting upon that unchangeable foundation , the granite .",64,"('granite', 'granit', 'granito')",1
