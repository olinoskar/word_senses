"but the dam held firm , and after a moment of terrible suspense the torrent precipitated itself into grant lake from a height of twenty feet .",22
"the plateau of prospect heights , granite house , and the dockyard were for the moment preserved .",4
"we had long lost sight of the sea shore behind the hills of bones . the rash professor , careless of losing his way , hurried me forward . we advanced in silence , bathed in luminous electric fluid . by some phenomenon which i am unable to explain , it lighted up all sides of every object equally . such was its diffusiveness , there being no central point from which the light emanated , that shadows no longer existed . you might have thought yourself under the rays of a vertical sun in a tropical region at noonday and the height of summer . no vapour was visible . the rocks , the distant mountains , a few isolated clumps of forest trees in the distance , presented a weird and wonderful aspect under these totally new conditions of a universal diffusion of light . we were like hoffmann 's shadowless man .",102
"happily , this enclosure , sheltered by the southeastern spur of mount franklin , did not greatly suffer from the violence of the hurricanes , which spared its trees , sheds , and palisades ; but the poultry - yard on prospect heights , being directly exposed to the gusts of wind from the east , suffered considerable damage .",42
"' well , i should like to be a little larger , sir , if you would n't mind , ' said alice : ' three inches is such a wretched height to be . '",31
cyrus harding now imparted to his companions a scheme for completely isolating prospect heights so as to shelter it from the attacks both of quadrupeds and quadrumana .,13
""" would you dare to lift your hand to your queen ? "" said anne of austria , drawing herself up to her full height , and fixing her eyes upon the chancellor with an expression almost threatening .",24
"now , if these bridges can be raised at will , prospect heights will be guarded from any surprise . """,12
"herbert then in a few words related the incidents of the voyage , and dwelt on the curious fact of the sort of passing gleam in the prisoner 's mind , when for an instant in the height of the storm he had become a sailor .",37
"here and there i could see puffs and jets of steam curling up into the air , called in icelandic ' reykir , ' issuing from thermal springs , and indicating by their motion the volcanic energy underneath . this seemed to justify my fears : but i fell from the height of my new - born hopes when my uncle said :",51
"the wind also blew with great violence , and at the height of granite house the sea could be heard thundering against the reefs .",11
"ned land was about forty years old . a man of great height -- over six english feet -- he was powerfully built , serious in manner , not very sociable , sometimes headstrong , and quite ill - tempered when crossed . his looks caught the attention , and above all the strength of his gaze , which gave a unique emphasis to his facial appearance .",12
"in fact , there beneath my eyes was a town in ruins , demolished , overwhelmed , laid low , its roofs caved in , its temples pulled down , its arches dislocated , its columns stretching over the earth ; in these ruins you could still detect the solid proportions of a sort of tuscan architecture ; farther off , the remains of a gigantic aqueduct ; here , the caked heights of an acropolis along with the fluid forms of a parthenon ; there , the remnants of a wharf , as if some bygone port had long ago harbored merchant vessels and triple - tiered war galleys on the shores of some lost ocean ; still farther off , long rows of collapsing walls , deserted thoroughfares , a whole pompeii buried under the waters , which captain nemo had resurrected before my eyes !",72
"just then a huge cave opened up in our path , hollowed from a picturesque pile of rocks whose smooth heights were completely hung with underwater flora . at first this cave looked pitch - black to me . inside , the sun 's rays seemed to diminish by degrees . their hazy transparency was nothing more than drowned light .",20
"this stream of electricity dazzled my eyes , and after momentarily shutting them , i looked around . the nautilus was stationary . it was floating next to an embankment shaped like a wharf . as for the water now buoying the ship , it was a lake completely encircled by an inner wall about two miles in diameter , hence six miles around . its level -- as indicated by the pressure gauge -- would be the same as the outside level , because some connection had to exist between this lake and the sea . slanting inward over their base , these high walls converged to form a vault shaped like an immense upside - down funnel that measured 500 or 600 meters in height . at its summit there gaped the circular opening through which i had detected that faint glimmer , obviously daylight .",126
"we were in reality shut up inside an immeasurable excavation . its width could not be estimated , since the shore ran widening as far as eye could reach , nor could its length , for the dim horizon bounded the new . as for its height , it must have been several leagues . where this vault rested upon its granite base no eye could tell ; but there was a cloud hanging far above , the height of which we estimated at 12,000 feet , a greater height than that of any terrestrial vapour , and no doubt due to the great density of the air .",78

it will be easily conceived that after an imprisonment of forty seven days in a narrow gallery it was the height of physical enjoyment to breathe a moist air impregnated with saline particles .,20
"they had not been able to perceive the sinister aspect of this shore from the summit of mount franklin , for they overlooked it from too great a height , but viewed from the sea it presented a wild appearance which could not perhaps be equaled in any corner of the globe .",28
""" well , i reply that you shall be served to the height of your wishes , and that we shall see each other every day . """,12
"the weather was fine and clear , and from a height of a hillock on which neb and pencroft had arranged breakfast , a wide view was obtained .",10
"beyond , towards the north , the forest border was prolonged for a space of nearly two miles ; then the trees became scarcer , and beyond that again the picturesque heights described a nearly straight line , which ran north and south .",31
"as this was the height of d’artagnan ’s worldly ambition -- apart , be it well understood , from his desire of finding mme . bonacieux -- he ran , full of joy , to seek his comrades , whom he had left only half an hour before , but whom he found very sad and deeply preoccupied .",4
"but at that moment my attention was drawn to an unexpected sight . at a distance of five hundred paces , at the turn of a high promontory , appeared a high , tufted , dense forest . it was composed of trees of moderate height , formed like umbrellas , with exact geometrical outlines . the currents of wind seemed to have had no effect upon their shape , and in the midst of the windy blasts they stood unmoved and firm , just like a clump of petrified cedars .",45
before the cold season should appear the most assiduous care was given to the cultivation of the wild plants which had been transplanted from the forest to prospect heights .,28
""" we mean , captain , "" answered pencroft , "" that on board the ' bonadventure ' we were very anxious during the few hours before our return , and we should have passed to windward of the island , if it had not been for the precaution you took of lighting a fire the night of the 19th of october , on prospect heights .

"harding applied his eye to the aperture , which overlooked the ground from a height of eighty feet .",14

""" nor that either , "" he answered . "" this is no northern mountain ; here are no granite peaks capped with snow . look , axel , look ! "" above our heads , at a height of five hundred feet or more , we saw the crater of a volcano , through which , at intervals of fifteen minutes or so , there issued with loud explosions lofty columns of fire , mingled with pumice stones , ashes , and flowing lava . i could feel the heaving of the mountain , which seemed to breathe like a huge whale , and puff out fire and wind from its vast blowholes . beneath , down a pretty steep declivity , ran streams of lava for eight or nine hundred feet , giving the mountain a height of about 1,300 or 1,400 feet . but the base of the mountain was hidden in a perfect bower of rich verdure , amongst which i was able to distinguish the olive , the fig , and vines , covered with their luscious purple bunches .",38

"the cabman scratched his head . "" well , he was n't altogether such an easy gentleman to describe . i 'd put him at forty years of age , and he was of a middle height , two or three inches shorter than you , sir . he was dressed like a toff , and he had a black beard , cut square at the end , and a pale face . i do n't know as i could say more than that .

"at the back of this creek some violent convulsion had torn up the rocky border , and a cutting , by a gentle slope , gave access to an upper plateau , which might be situated at least ten miles from claw cape , and consequently four miles in a straight line from prospect heights .",54
"alice did not much like keeping so close to her : first , because the duchess was very ugly ; and secondly , because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon alice 's shoulder , and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin . however , she did not like to be rude , so she bore it as well as she could .",29
"but a kind of lurid brilliancy spread over the island , against which stood out confusedly the wooded masses of the heights .",21
"towards the end of the month , herbert was already walking about on prospect heights , and the beach .",14
"just at this moment there was an unusual stir in the human mass . all the hands were raised in the air . some , tightly closed , seemed to disappear suddenly in the midst of the cries -- an energetic way , no doubt , of casting a vote . the crowd swayed back , the banners and flags wavered , disappeared an instant , then reappeared in tatters . the undulations of the human surge reached the steps , while all the heads floundered on the surface like a sea agitated by a squall . many of the black hats disappeared , and the greater part of the crowd seemed to have diminished in height .",116
"i rubbed my eyes , i looked at him attentively . i saw him hanged , and i fainted away : scarce had i recovered my senses , when i saw you stripped of clothing ; this was the height of horror , grief , and despair .",39
"but herbert , from the height of his observatory , could examine all the yet unknown portion of the island , which might have given shelter to the strangers whose presence they suspected .",5
"on the contrary this was a uniform mass of verdure , out of which rose two or three hills of no great height .",22
"how i wished at this moment i could have made him understand me . my words , my complaints , my sorrow would have had some influence over that frigid nature . those dangers which our guide could not understand i could have demonstrated and proved to him . together we might have over - ruled the obstinate professor ; if it were needed , we might perhaps have compelled him to regain the heights of snæfell .",74

"i started moving , groping my way . after five steps i encountered an iron wall made of riveted boilerplate . then , turning around , i bumped into a wooden table next to which several stools had been set . the floor of this prison lay hidden beneath thick , hempen matting that deadened the sound of footsteps . its naked walls did n't reveal any trace of a door or window . going around the opposite way , conseil met up with me , and we returned to the middle of this cabin , which had to be twenty feet long by ten wide . as for its height , not even ned land , with his great stature , was able to determine it .",110
"for some minutes i am still contemplating the geyser . i notice that it throws up its column of water with variable force : sometimes sending it to a great height , then again to a lower , which i attribute to the variable pressure of the steam accumulated in its reservoir .",30
"as to the points of the compass , the engineer had roughly fixed them by the height and position of the sun , which placed union bay and prospect heights to the east .",29
"the engineer , after having explored the wall at a certain height horizontally , fastened the lamp to the end of an oar , and again surveyed the basaltic wall at a greater elevation .",11
"blanche and mary were of equal stature,--straight and tall as poplars . mary was too slim for her height , but blanche was moulded like a dian .",18
""" this was the first point gained . i then walked slowly down the garden path , which happened to be composed of a clay soil , peculiarly suitable for taking impressions . no doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush , but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning . there is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps . happily , i have always laid great stress upon it , and much practice has made it second nature to me . i saw the heavy footmarks of the constables , but i saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden . it was easy to tell that they had been before the others , because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them . in this way my second link was formed , which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number , one remarkable for his height ( as i calculated from the length of his stride ) , and the other fashionably dressed , to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots .",190
"the elliptical roof , under which the boat at first passed , suddenly rose ; but the darkness was too deep , and the light of the lantern too slight , for either the extent , length , height , or depth of the cave to be ascertained .",38
"and yet it may seem a small matter in itself . you are aware that i am not a very sound sleeper , and since i have been on guard in this house my slumbers have been lighter than ever . last night , about two in the morning , i was aroused by a stealthy step passing my room . i rose , opened my door , and peeped out . a long black shadow was trailing down the corridor . it was thrown by a man who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in his hand . he was in shirt and trousers , with no covering to his feet . i could merely see the outline , but his height told me that it was barrymore . he walked very slowly and circumspectly , and there was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole appearance .",125
"such is fingal 's cave , in the island of staffa , one of the hebrides ; such are the caves of morgat , in the bay of douarnenez , in brittany , the caves of bonifacio , in corsica , those of lyse - fjord , in norway ; such are the immense mammoth caverns in kentucky , 500 feet in height , and more than twenty miles in length !",62
"at a height of a hundred feet rose the vaulted roof , supported on basalt shafts .",2
"the soil sloped gradually from mount franklin to the east coast , and it was to be feared that , in spite of the thick jacamar wood , the torrent would reach the plateau of prospect heights .",36
"the great question certainly was , what ? alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass , but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances . there was a large mushroom growing near her , about the same height as herself ; and when she had looked under it , and on both sides of it , and behind it , it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it .",54
"their insufficiency was still more clearly shown when a troop of quadrupeds , jumping , bounding , making leaps of thirty feet , regular flying mammiferae , fled over the thickets , so quickly and at such a height , that one would have thought that they passed from one tree to another like squirrels .",38
