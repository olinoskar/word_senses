"properly speaking , the sargasso sea covers every submerged part of atlantis . certain authors have even held that the many weeds strewn over this sea were torn loose from the prairies of that ancient continent . but it 's more likely that these grasses , algae , and fucus plants were carried off from the beaches of europe and america , then taken as far as this zone by the gulf stream . this is one of the reasons why christopher columbus assumed the existence of a new world . when the ships of that bold investigator arrived in the sargasso sea , they had great difficulty navigating in the midst of these weeds , which , much to their crews ' dismay , slowed them down to a halt ; and they wasted three long weeks crossing this sector .",63

"the old philosopher , whose name was martin , took shipping with candide for bordeaux .",9

"this done , pencroft , passing among the grass and concealing himself skillfully , placed the end of his lines armed with hooks near the grouse nests ; then he returned , took the other ends and hid with herbert behind a large tree .",32
"they walked along , pecking the ground , and not suspecting in any way the presence of the hunters , who , besides , had taken care to place themselves to leeward of the gallinaceae .",25
""" yes , monsieur l'abbe , "" answered candide , "" i must absolutely wait upon miss cunegund , "" and then the pleasure he took in talking about the object he loved , led him insensibly to relate , according to custom , part of his adventures with that illustrious westphalian beauty .",25

"the governor of buenos ayres has taken everything from me but your heart , which i still retain .",6

"distracted between these two passions he took his gold and his diamonds , and procured a person to conduct him and martin to the house where miss cunegund lodged . upon entering the room he felt his limbs tremble , his heart flutter , his tongue falter ; he attempted to undraw the curtain , and called for a light to the bedside .",6
"it was the first time that he had ever seen birds taken with a line , but the sailor modestly confessed that it was not his first attempt , and that besides he could not claim the merit of invention .",11
"' what did they live on ? ' said alice , who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking .",13
"' take some more tea , ' the march hare said to alice , very earnestly .",1
"the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it , and then said , ' it was a treacle - well . '",3
"he moved on as he spoke , and the dormouse followed him : the march hare moved into the dormouse 's place , and alice rather unwillingly took the place of the march hare . the hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change : and alice was a good deal worse off than before , as the march hare had just upset the milk - jug into his plate .",27

"they very soon came upon a gryphon , lying fast asleep in the sun . ( if you do n't know what a gryphon is , look at the picture . ) ' up , lazy thing !

"just as they rose from table , in came four serene highnesses , who had also been stripped of their territories by the fortune of war , and had come to spend the remainder of the carnival at venice . candide took no manner of notice of them ; for his thoughts were wholly employed on his voyage to constantinople , where he intended to go in search of his lovely miss cunegund .",41
"the trusty cacambo had already engaged the captain of the turkish ship that was to carry sultan achmet back to constantinople to take candide and martin on board . accordingly they both embarked , after paying their obeisance to his miserable highness .",22
