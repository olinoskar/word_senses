"our two inhabitants of the other hemisphere amused themselves greatly with what they saw . the quoits were large , round pieces , yellow , red , and green , which cast a most glorious luster . our travelers picked some of them up , and they proved to be gold , emeralds , rubies , and diamonds ; the least of which would have been the greatest ornament to the superb throne of the great mogul .",39
"the whole company started forward at once . the captain had only to pick his men . thirty were chosen , and an old sergeant placed at their head .",13
"this time there could be no doubt ; dâ€™artagnan was really insulted . full , then , of this conviction , he pulled his cap down over his eyes , and endeavoring to copy some of the court airs he had picked up in gascony among young traveling nobles , he advanced with one hand on the hilt of his sword and the other resting on his hip .",41
"as soon as dinner was over , both candide and cacambo thought they should pay very handsomely for their entertainment by laying down two of those large gold pieces which they had picked off the ground ; but the landlord and landlady burst into a fit of laughing and held their sides for some time .",32
"supper , this evening , was of course composed of the inevitable lithodomes , of which herbert and neb picked up a plentiful supply on the beach .",19
"he was a picard , whom the glorious musketeer had picked up on the bridge tournelle , making rings and plashing in the water .",10
"a long line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips , and of yellow and red roses , defiled in front of him , threading their way through the huge , jade - green piles of vegetables . under the portico , with its grey , sun - bleached pillars , loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls , waiting for the auction to be over . others crowded round the swinging doors of the coffee - house in the piazza . the heavy cart - horses slipped and stamped upon the rough stones , shaking their bells and trappings . some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks . iris - necked and pink - footed , the pigeons ran about picking up seeds .",126
"many natural excavations situated in the upper passage were enlarged either by pick - axe or mine , and granite house thus became a general warehouse , containing all the provisions , arms , tools , and spare utensils -- in a word , all the stores of the colony .",12
"audley court was not an attractive locality . the narrow passage led us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings . we picked our way among groups of dirty children , and through lines of discoloured linen , until we came to number 46 , the door of which was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name rance was engraved . on enquiry we found that the constable was in bed , and we were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming .",26
"captain nemo had picked an odd time to philosophize . all in all , this reply told me nothing .",3

"i strolled for a little while from the lounge into the library . my companions kept their seats and did n't move . soon i threw myself down on a couch and picked up a book , which my eyes skimmed mechanically .",32
"and besides , my dear old basil , if you really want to console me , teach me rather to forget what has happened , or to see it from a proper artistic point of view . was it not gautier who used to write about la consolation des arts ? i remember picking up a little vellum - covered book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase . well , i am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at marlow together , the young man who used to say that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life . i love beautiful things that one can touch and handle . old brocades , green bronzes , lacquer - work , carved ivories , exquisite surroundings , luxury , pomp -- there is much to be got from all these . but the artistic temperament that they create , or at any rate reveal , is still more to me .",53
"equipped with a magnifying glass , he lit a fire of deadwood that was soon crackling merrily . meanwhile conseil and i selected the finest artocarpus fruit . some still were n't ripe enough , and their thick skins covered white , slightly fibrous pulps . but a great many others were yellowish and gelatinous , just begging to be picked .",60

""" a regular egg - field , "" observed gideon spilett , "" and we have nothing to do but to pick them up . """,21
"work began immediately and was carried on with tireless tenacity . instead of digging all around the nautilus , which would have entailed even greater difficulties , captain nemo had an immense trench outlined on the ice , eight meters from our port quarter . then his men simultaneously staked it off at several points around its circumference . soon their picks were vigorously attacking this compact matter , and huge chunks were loosened from its mass . these chunks weighed less than the water , and by an unusual effect of specific gravity , each chunk took wing , as it were , to the roof of the tunnel , which thickened above by as much as it diminished below . but this hardly mattered so long as the lower surface kept growing thinner .",61
"so we returned through the forest , and we completed our harvest by making a clean sweep of some palm cabbages that had to be picked from the crowns of their trees , some small beans that i recognized as the "" abrou "" of the malaysians , and some high - quality yams .",25
""" what can i do for you , mr . gray ? "" he said , rubbing his fat freckled hands .

"he wondered if he had met the men in the hall as they were leaving the house and had wormed out of them what they had been doing . he would be sure to miss the picture -- had no doubt missed it already , while he had been laying the tea - things . the screen had not been set back , and a blank space was visible on the wall . perhaps some night he might find him creeping upstairs and trying to force the door of the room . it was a horrible thing to have a spy in one 's house . he had heard of rich men who had been blackmailed all their lives by some servant who had read a letter , or overheard a conversation , or picked up a card with an address , or found beneath a pillow a withered flower or a shred of crumpled lace .",134
"that day , the sixth of our imprisonment , captain nemo concluded that picks and mattocks were too slow to deal with the ice layer still separating us from open water -- and he decided to crush this layer . the man had kept his energy and composure . he had subdued physical pain with moral strength . he could still think , plan , and act .",13
"half an hour after the canadian 's latest exploits , we were back on the inner beach . there the local flora was represented by a wide carpet of samphire , a small umbelliferous plant that keeps quite nicely , which also boasts the names glasswort , saxifrage , and sea fennel . conseil picked a couple bunches . as for the local fauna , it included thousands of crustaceans of every type : lobsters , hermit crabs , prawns , mysid shrimps , daddy longlegs , rock crabs , and a prodigious number of seashells , such as cowries , murex snails , and limpets .",54
""" well , i would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented road , "" i reflected .

""" my dear boy , the people who love only once in their lives are really the shallow people . what they call their loyalty , and their fidelity , i call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination . faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect -- simply a confession of failure . faithfulness ! i must analyse it some day . the passion for property is in it . there are many things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might pick them up . but i do n't want to interrupt you . go on with your story .

""" i was at the louvre on the day when he scattered his pearls ; and , pardieu , i picked up two that i sold for ten pistoles each .",20

"sheer chance had placed us in the presence of this squid , and i did n't want to lose this opportunity to meticulously study such a cephalopod specimen . i overcame the horror that its appearance inspired in me , picked up a pencil , and began to sketch it .",40
"near four o'clock in the morning , the submersible picked up speed . we could barely cope with this dizzying rush , and the waves battered us at close range . fortunately ned 's hands came across a big mooring ring fastened to the topside of this sheet - iron back , and we all held on for dear life .",9
"violent squalls assaulted us during the daytime . thanks to certain heavy mists , we could n't see from one end of the platform to the other . the wind shifted abruptly to every point on the compass . the snow was piling up in such packed layers , it had to be chipped loose with blows from picks . even in a temperature of merely -5 degrees centigrade , every outside part of the nautilus was covered with ice . a ship 's rigging would have been unusable , because all its tackle would have jammed in the grooves of the pulleys . only a craft without sails , driven by an electric motor that needed no coal , could face such high latitudes .",58
"they ran with pick - axes and iron - tipped poles in their hands , passed over the mercy bridge , descended the right bank of the river , along the beach , and in less than twenty minutes the settlers were close to the enormous animal , above which flocks of birds already hovered .",3
"indeed , the table had been laid . apparently captain nemo had given this order at the same time he commanded the nautilus to pick up speed .",24
"so she was considering in her own mind ( as well as she could , for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid ) , whether the pleasure of making a daisy - chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies , when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her .",46
"six months before , a bottle , enclosing a document written in english , german , and french , had been found in the irish sea , and picked up by the ' duncan . '",28
"the pick had soon penetrated two feet into the granite partition , and our man had worked for above an hour . i was in an agony of impatience . my uncle wanted to employ stronger measures , and i had some difficulty in dissuading him ; still he had just taken a pickaxe in his hand , when a sudden hissing was heard , and a jet of water spurted out with violence against the opposite wall .",1
"near two o'clock i was busy organizing my notes in the lounge , when the captain opened the door and appeared . i bowed to him . he gave me an almost imperceptible bow in return , without saying a word to me . i resumed my work , hoping he might give me some explanation of the previous afternoon 's events . he did nothing of the sort . i stared at him . his face looked exhausted ; his reddened eyes had n't been refreshed by sleep ; his facial features expressed profound sadness , real chagrin . he walked up and down , sat and stood , picked up a book at random , discarded it immediately , consulted his instruments without taking his customary notes , and seemed unable to rest easy for an instant .",110
""" the ' duncan ' disembarked her passengers on the western coast of patagonia , and sailed to pick them up again on the eastern coast at cape corrientes .",18
"captain nemo 's companion picked up the animal , loaded it on his shoulder , and we took to the trail again .",4
"equipped with picks , some ten men climbed onto the nautilus 's sides and cracked loose the ice around the ship 's lower plating , which was soon set free . this operation was swiftly executed because the fresh ice was still thin . we all reentered the interior . the main ballast tanks were filled with the water that had n't yet congealed at our line of flotation . the nautilus submerged without delay .",2
"meanwhile the grave digging went slowly . fish fled here and there as their retreat was disturbed . i heard the pick ringing on the limestone soil , its iron tip sometimes giving off sparks when it hit a stray piece of flint on the sea bottom . the hole grew longer , wider , and soon was deep enough to receive the body .",21
"to this end , i had sat well back on the form , and while seeming to be busy with my sum , had held my slate in such a manner as to conceal my face : i might have escaped notice , had not my treacherous slate somehow happened to slip from my hand , and falling with an obtrusive crash , directly drawn every eye upon me ; i knew it was all over now , and , as i stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate , i rallied my forces for the worst . it came .",84
"at these words he threw me a crown , which i picked up , and he took the ladder .",11
"from that time , dâ€™artagnan had been cautious with respect to handkerchiefs with arms on them , and he therefore placed in the pocket of mme . bonacieux the one he had just picked up .",33

"' oh , i beg your pardon !

"during that day a fearsome school of sharks provided us with an escort . dreadful animals that teem in these seas and make them extremely dangerous . there were port jackson sharks with a brown back , a whitish belly , and eleven rows of teeth , bigeye sharks with necks marked by a large black spot encircled in white and resembling an eye , and isabella sharks whose rounded snouts were strewn with dark speckles . often these powerful animals rushed at the lounge window with a violence less than comforting . by this point ned land had lost all self - control . he wanted to rise to the surface of the waves and harpoon the monsters , especially certain smooth - hound sharks whose mouths were paved with teeth arranged like a mosaic , and some big five - meter tiger sharks that insisted on personally provoking him . but the nautilus soon picked up speed and easily left astern the fastest of these man - eaters .",156
