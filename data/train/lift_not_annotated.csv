"gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand . at his call they entered the room , and the stranger was lifted and carried out . as they raised him , a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor . lestrade grabbed it up and stared at it with mystified eyes .",22
"as the dawn was just breaking , he found himself close to covent garden . the darkness lifted , and , flushed with faint fires , the sky hollowed itself into a perfect pearl . huge carts filled with nodding lilies rumbled slowly down the polished empty street . the air was heavy with the perfume of the flowers , and their beauty seemed to bring him an anodyne for his pain . he followed into the market and watched the men unloading their waggons . a white - smocked carter offered him some cherries . he thanked him , wondered why he refused to accept any money for them , and began to eat them listlessly . they had been plucked at midnight , and the coldness of the moon had entered into them .",17
"it was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog had lifted . meanwhile we left lestrade in possession of the house while holmes and i went back with the baronet to baskerville hall . the story of the stapletons could no longer be withheld from him , but he took the blow bravely when he learned the truth about the woman whom he had loved . but the shock of the night 's adventures had shattered his nerves , and before morning he lay delirious in a high fever , under the care of dr . mortimer . the two of them were destined to travel together round the world before sir henry had become once more the hale , hearty man that he had been before he became master of that ill - omened estate .",15

""" an enormous block of ice , an entire mountain , has toppled over , "" he answered me . "" when an iceberg is eroded at the base by warmer waters or by repeated collisions , its center of gravity rises . then it somersaults , it turns completely upside down . that 's what happened here . when it overturned , one of these blocks hit the nautilus as it was cruising under the waters . sliding under our hull , this block then raised us with irresistible power , lifting us into less congested strata where we now lie on our side .

"but we could n't stop . we had to follow the captain , who headed down trails seemingly known only to himself . the seafloor rose noticeably , and when i lifted my arms , sometimes they would pass above the surface of the sea . then the level of the oysterbank would lower unpredictably . often we went around tall , pointed rocks rising like pyramids . in their dark crevices huge crustaceans , aiming their long legs like heavy artillery , watched us with unblinking eyes , while underfoot there crept millipedes , bloodworms , aricia worms , and annelid worms , whose antennas and tubular tentacles were incredibly long .",31

""" in order to steer this boat to port or starboard , in short , to make turns on a horizontal plane , i use an ordinary , wide - bladed rudder that 's fastened to the rear of the sternpost and worked by a wheel and tackle . but i can also move the nautilus upward and downward on a vertical plane by the simple method of slanting its two fins , which are attached to its sides at its center of flotation ; these fins are flexible , able to assume any position , and can be operated from inside by means of powerful levers . if these fins stay parallel with the boat , the latter moves horizontally . if they slant , the nautilus follows the angle of that slant and , under its propeller 's thrust , either sinks on a diagonal as steep as it suits me , or rises on that diagonal . and similarly , if i want to return more swiftly to the surface , i throw the propeller in gear , and the water 's pressure makes the nautilus rise vertically , as an air balloon inflated with hydrogen lifts swiftly into the skies .

"it was passepartout ; and what had happened to him was as follows : shortly after fix left the opium den , two waiters had lifted the unconscious passepartout , and had carried him to the bed reserved for the smokers . three hours later , pursued even in his dreams by a fixed idea , the poor fellow awoke , and struggled against the stupefying influence of the narcotic . the thought of a duty unfulfilled shook off his torpor , and he hurried from the abode of drunkenness . staggering and holding himself up by keeping against the walls , falling down and creeping up again , and irresistibly impelled by a kind of instinct , he kept crying out , "" the carnatic ! the carnatic !

"the entrance into this place i made to be , not by a door , but by a short ladder to go over the top ; which ladder , when i was in , i lifted over after me ; and so i was completely fenced in and fortified , as i thought , from all the world , and consequently slept secure in the night , which otherwise i could not have done ; though , as it appeared afterwards , there was no need of all this caution from the enemies that i apprehended danger from .",35

"meanwhile , crazed with terror , the unhinged papuans beat a retreat . as for us , half laughing , we massaged and comforted poor ned land , who was swearing like one possessed . but just then , lifted off by the tide 's final undulations , the nautilus left its coral bed at exactly that fortieth minute pinpointed by the captain . its propeller churned the waves with lazy majesty . gathering speed little by little , the ship navigated on the surface of the ocean , and safe and sound , it left behind the dangerous narrows of the torres strait .",39
"on january 13 , arriving in the timor sea , captain nemo raised the island of that name at longitude 122 degrees . this island , whose surface area measures 1,625 square leagues , is governed by rajahs . these aristocrats deem themselves the sons of crocodiles , in other words , descendants with the most exalted origins to which a human being can lay claim . accordingly , their scaly ancestors infest the island 's rivers and are the subjects of special veneration . they are sheltered , nurtured , flattered , pampered , and offered a ritual diet of nubile maidens ; and woe to the foreigner who lifts a finger against these sacred saurians .",110
