"other zoophytes swarming near the sponges consisted chiefly of a very elegant species of jellyfish ; mollusks were represented by varieties of squid that , according to professor orbigny , are unique to the red sea ; and reptiles by virgata turtles belonging to the genus chelonia , which furnished our table with a dainty but wholesome dish .",0
"as for fish , they were numerous and often remarkable . here are the ones that the nautilus 's nets most frequently hauled on board : rays , including spotted rays that were oval in shape and brick red in color , their bodies strewn with erratic blue speckles and identifiable by their jagged double stings , silver - backed skates , common stingrays with stippled tails , butterfly rays that looked like huge two - meter cloaks flapping at middepth , toothless guitarfish that were a type of cartilaginous fish closer to the shark , trunkfish known as dromedaries that were one and a half feet long and had humps ending in backward - curving stings , serpentine moray eels with silver tails and bluish backs plus brown pectorals trimmed in gray piping , a species of butterfish called the fiatola decked out in thin gold stripes and the three colors of the french flag , montague blennies four decimeters long , superb jacks handsomely embellished by seven black crosswise streaks with blue and yellow fins plus gold and silver scales , snooks , standard mullet with yellow heads , parrotfish , wrasse , triggerfish , gobies , etc . , plus a thousand other fish common to the oceans we had already crossed .",205
