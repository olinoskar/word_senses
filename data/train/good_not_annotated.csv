"i was in some degree settled in my measures for carrying on the plantation before my kind friend , the captain of the ship that took me up at sea , went back — for the ship remained there , in providing his lading and preparing for his voyage , nearly three months — when telling him what little stock i had left behind me in london , he gave me this friendly and sincere advice:—“seignior inglese , ” says he ( for so he always called me ) , “ if you will give me letters , and a procuration in form to me , with orders to the person who has your money in london to send your effects to lisbon , to such persons as i shall direct , and in such goods as are proper for this country , i will bring you the produce of them , god willing , at my return ; but , since human affairs are all subject to changes and disasters , i would have you give orders but for one hundred pounds sterling , which , you say , is half your stock , and let the hazard be run for the first ; so that , if it come safe , you may order the rest the same way , and , if it miscarry , you may have the other half to have recourse to for your supply . ”",135
"this was so wholesome advice , and looked so friendly , that i could not but be convinced it was the best course i could take ; so i accordingly prepared letters to the gentlewoman with whom i had left my money , and a procuration to the portuguese captain , as he desired .",21
"the merchant in london , vesting this hundred pounds in english goods , such as the captain had written for , sent them directly to him at lisbon , and he brought them all safe to me to the brazils ; among which , without my direction ( for i was too young in my business to think of them ) , he had taken care to have all sorts of tools , ironwork , and utensils necessary for my plantation , and which were of great use to me .",11
"it was a flat tableland like that above cape town at the cape of good hope , but of reduced proportions ; at least so it appeared seen from the islet .",14
"but i , that was born to be my own destroyer , could no more resist the offer than i could restrain my first rambling designs when my father ’ good counsel was lost upon me . in a word , i told them i would go with all my heart , if they would undertake to look after my plantation in my absence , and would dispose of it to such as i should direct , if i miscarried . this they all engaged to do , and entered into writings or covenants to do so ; and i made a formal will , disposing of my plantation and effects in case of my death , making the captain of the ship that had saved my life , as before , my universal heir , but obliging him to dispose of my effects as i had directed in my will ; one half of the produce being to himself , and the other to be shipped to england .",30
