the first day of the voyage was not marked by any incident .,8,"('mark', 'marquer', 'ocurrir')",0
"the thermometer marked -12 degrees centigrade , and a fresh breeze left a sharp nip in the air . ice floes were increasing over the open water . the sea was starting to congeal everywhere . numerous blackish patches were spreading over its surface , announcing the imminent formation of fresh ice . obviously this southernmost basin froze over during its six - month winter and became utterly inaccessible . what happened to the whales during this period ? no doubt they went beneath the ice bank to find more feasible seas . as for seals and walruses , they were accustomed to living in the harshest climates and stayed on in these icy waterways . these animals know by instinct how to gouge holes in the ice fields and keep them continually open ; they go to these holes to breathe . once the birds have migrated northward to escape the cold , these marine mammals remain as sole lords of the polar continent .",2,"('mark', 'marquer', 'marcar')",1
"with his subtle smile , lord henry watched him . he knew the precise psychological moment when to say nothing . he felt intensely interested . he was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had produced , and , remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen , a book which had revealed to him much that he had not known before , he wondered whether dorian gray was passing through a similar experience . he had merely shot an arrow into the air . had it hit the mark ? how fascinating the lad was !",94,"('mark', 'but', 'blanco')",2
"cyrus harding , during breakfast , which neb had hastened to prepare , as the reporter , herbert , and pencroft were dying of hunger , heard in detail all the incidents which had marked the voyage of exploration to the islet .",34,"('mark', 'marquer', 'señalar')",3
""" but the thermometer marks fifty - eight degrees ! "" observed gideon spilett .",4,"('mark', 'marque', 'marcar')",4
"the exploration , therefore , continued , and was usefully marked by a discovery which herbert made of a tree whose fruit was edible .",10,"('mark', 'marquer', 'señalar')",3
"an hour after , the henrietta passed the lighthouse which marks the entrance of the hudson , turned the point of sandy hook , and put to sea . during the day she skirted long island , passed fire island , and directed her course rapidly eastward .",10,"('mark', 'marque', 'marcar')",4
"no animal had fallen into them , and yet the footprints in the neighborhood were very numerous , among others , certain very clear marks of claws .",24,"('mark', 'marque', 'marcar')",4
their return was marked by a fortunate incident ; the engineer discovered a substance which replaced tinder .,3,"('mark', 'marquer', 'señalar')",3
"according to the engineer 's calculation , the mercurial column of a fahrenheit thermometer would not have marked less than eight degrees below zero , and this intense cold , rendered still more painful by a sharp gale , lasted for several days .",17,"('mark', 'marquer', 'marcar')",1
for some while the voyage of the abraham lincoln was marked by no incident . but one circumstance arose that displayed ned land 's marvelous skills and showed just how much confidence we could place in him .,10,"('mark', 'marquer', 'marcar')",1
he carefully marked the place with a little stick .,2,"('mark', 'marquer', 'marcar')",1
"he frowned , and tearing the paper in two , went across the room and flung the pieces away . how ugly it all was ! and how horribly real ugliness made things ! he felt a little annoyed with lord henry for having sent him the report . and it was certainly stupid of him to have marked it with red pencil . victor might have read it . the man knew more than enough english for that .",58,"('mark', 'marquer', 'señalar')",3
"the liquid column had indeed disappeared , to give place to dense and still boiling eruptive matter of all kinds . the temperature was becoming unbearable . a thermometer exposed to this atmosphere would have marked 150 ° . the perspiration streamed from my body . but for the rapidity of our ascent we should have been suffocated .",35,"('mark', 'marquer', 'marcar')",1
"the engineer did so . the pressure gauge marked ten atmospheres . but no doubt the cetacean itself had "" warmed up , "" because without the least trouble , it also did 19.3 .",8,"('mark', 'marquer', 'marcar')",1
"and passepartout 's famous family watch , which had always kept london time , would have betrayed this fact , if it had marked the days as well as the hours and the minutes !",23,"('mark', 'marquer', 'marcar')",1
"the reporter held his chronometer in his hand , ready to tell the hour which it marked when the shadow would be at its shortest .",16,"('mark', 'marquer', 'marcar')",1

"the temperature was fairly low . exposed to the outside air , the thermometer marked -2 degrees to -3 degrees centigrade . but we were warmly dressed in furs , for which seals and aquatic bears had paid the price . evenly heated by all its electric equipment , the nautilus 's interior defied the most intense cold . moreover , to find a bearable temperature , the ship had only to sink just a few meters beneath the waves .",14,"('mark', 'marquer', 'marcar')",1

""",52,"('mark', 'marque', 'huella')",6
"we walked upon granite mingled with siliceous tufa . the soil shivers and shakes under our feet , like the sides of an overheated boiler filled with steam struggling to get loose . we come in sight of a small central basin , out of which the geyser springs . i plunge a register thermometer into the boiling water . it marks an intense heat of 325 ° , which is far above the boiling point ; therefore this water issues from an ardent furnace , which is not at all in harmony with professor liedenbrock 's theories . i can not help making the remark .",61,"('mark', 'marque', 'marcar')",4
"however , the temperature was not as yet much lower , and a centigrade thermometer , transported to lincoln island , would still have marked an average of ten to twelve degrees above zero .",24,"('mark', 'marquer', 'marcar')",1

"first it marked out a race - course , in a sort of circle , ( ' the exact shape does n't matter , ' it said , ) and then all the party were placed along the course , here and there . there was no ' one , two , three , and away , ' but they began running when they liked , and left off when they liked , so that it was not easy to know when the race was over . however , when they had been running half an hour or so , and were quite dry again , the dodo suddenly called out ' the race is over !

""" now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find everything else for yourself . now let me endeavour to show you the different steps in my reasoning . to begin at the beginning . i approached the house , as you know , on foot , and with my mind entirely free from all impressions . i naturally began by examining the roadway , and there , as i have already explained to you , i saw clearly the marks of a cab , which , i ascertained by inquiry , must have been there during the night . i satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels . the ordinary london growler is considerably less wide than a gentleman 's brougham .",87,"('mark', 'trace', 'marcar')",11
""" this was the first point gained . i then walked slowly down the garden path , which happened to be composed of a clay soil , peculiarly suitable for taking impressions . no doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush , but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning . there is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps . happily , i have always laid great stress upon it , and much practice has made it second nature to me . i saw the heavy footmarks of the constables , but i saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden . it was easy to tell that they had been before the others , because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them . in this way my second link was formed , which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number , one remarkable for his height ( as i calculated from the length of his stride ) , and the other fashionably dressed , to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots .",54,"('mark', 'trace', 'marcar')",11
"i rushed up onto the platform . yes , open sea ! barely a few sparse floes , some moving icebergs ; a sea stretching into the distance ; hosts of birds in the air and myriads of fish under the waters , which varied from intense blue to olive green depending on the depth . the thermometer marked 3 degrees centigrade . it was as if a comparative springtime had been locked up behind that ice bank , whose distant masses were outlined on the northern horizon .",58,"('mark', 'marquer', 'marcar')",1
