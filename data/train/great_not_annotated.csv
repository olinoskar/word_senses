"neither was this all ; for my goods being all english manufacture , such as cloths , stuffs , baize , and things particularly valuable and desirable in the country , i found means to sell them to a very great advantage ; so that i might say i had more than four times the value of my first cargo , and was now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour — i mean in the advancement of my plantation ; for the first thing i did , i bought me a negro slave , and an european servant also — i mean another besides that which the captain brought me from lisbon .",40

"after i had been there about ten or twelve days , it came into my thoughts that i should lose my reckoning of time for want of books , and pen and ink , and should even forget the sabbath days ; but to prevent this , i cut with my knife upon a large post , in capital letters — and making it into a great cross , i set it up on the shore where i first landed—“i came on shore here on the 30th september 1659 . ” upon the sides of this square post i cut every day a notch with my knife , and every seventh notch was as long again as the rest , and every first day of the month as long again as that long one ; and thus i kept my calendar , or weekly , monthly , and yearly reckoning of time .",66

"and if nothing happens without his knowledge , he knows that i am here , and am in this dreadful condition ; and if nothing happens without his appointment , he has appointed all this to befall me . nothing occurred to my thought to contradict any of these conclusions , and therefore it rested upon me with the greater force , that it must needs be that god had appointed all this to befall me ; that i was brought into this miserable circumstance by his direction , he having the sole power , not of me only , but of everything that happened in the world . immediately it followed : why has god done this to me ? what have i done to be thus used ? my conscience presently checked me in that inquiry , as if i had blasphemed , and methought it spoke to me like a voice : “ wretch ! dost _ thou _ ask what thou hast done ? look back upon a dreadful misspent life , and ask thyself what thou hast _ not _ done ? ask , why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed ? why wert thou not drowned in yarmouth roads ; killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the sallee man - of - war ; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of africa ; or drowned _ here _ , when all the crew perished but thyself ? dost _ thou _ ask , what have i done ? ” i was struck dumb with these reflections , as one astonished , and had not a word to say — no , not to answer to myself , but rose up pensive and sad , walked back to my retreat , and went up over my wall , as if i had been going to bed ; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed , and i had no inclination to sleep ; so i sat down in my chair , and lighted my lamp , for it began to be dark . now , as the apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me very much , it occurred to my thought that the brazilians take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers , and i had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests , which was quite cured , and some also that was green , and not quite cured .",59

"another reflection was of great use to me , and doubtless would be so to any one that should fall into such distress as mine was ; and this was , to compare my present condition with what i at first expected it would be ; nay , with what it would certainly have been , if the good providence of god had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up nearer to the shore , where i not only could come at her , but could bring what i got out of her to the shore , for my relief and comfort ; without which , i had wanted for tools to work , weapons for defence , and gunpowder and shot for getting my food .",4
