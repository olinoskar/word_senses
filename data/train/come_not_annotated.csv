"my first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this moor , to get something for our subsistence on board ; for i told him we must not presume to eat of our patron ’s bread . he said that was true ; so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit , and three jars of fresh water , into the boat . i knew where my patron ’s case of bottles stood , which it was evident , by the make , were taken out of some english prize , and i conveyed them into the boat while the moor was on shore , as if they had been there before for our master . i conveyed also a great lump of beeswax into the boat , which weighed about half a hundred - weight , with a parcel of twine or thread , a hatchet , a saw , and a hammer , all of which were of great use to us afterwards , especially the wax , to make candles . another trick i tried upon him , which he innocently came into also : his name was ismael , which they call muley , or moely ; so i called to him—“moely , ” said i , “ our patron ’s guns are on board the boat ; can you not get a little powder and shot ? it may be we may kill some alcamies ( a fowl like our curlews ) for ourselves , for i know he keeps the gunner ’s stores in the ship . ” “ yes , ” says he , “ i ’ll bring some ; ” and accordingly he brought a great leather pouch , which held a pound and a half of powder , or rather more ; and another with shot , that had five or six pounds , with some bullets , and put all into the boat . at the same time i had found some powder of my master ’s in the great cabin , with which i filled one of the large bottles in the case , which was almost empty , pouring what was in it into another ; and thus furnished with everything needful , we sailed out of the port to fish . the castle , which is at the entrance of the port , knew who we were , and took no notice of us ; and we were not above a mile out of the port before we hauled in our sail and set us down to fish . the wind blew from the n.n.e . , which was contrary to my desire , for had it blown southerly i had been sure to have made the coast of spain , and at least reached to the bay of cadiz ; but my resolutions were , blow which way it would , i would be gone from that horrid place where i was , and leave the rest to fate .",188

"but , alas ! for me to do wrong that never did right , was no great wonder . i hail no remedy but to go on : i had got into an employment quite remote to my genius , and directly contrary to the life i delighted in , and for which i forsook my father ’s house , and broke through all his good advice . nay , i was coming into the very middle station , or upper degree of low life , which my father advised me to before , and which , if i resolved to go on with , i might as well have stayed at home , and never have fatigued myself in the world as i had done ; and i used often to say to myself , i could have done this as well in england , among my friends , as have gone five thousand miles off to do it among strangers and savages , in a wilderness , and at such a distance as never to hear from any part of the world that had the least knowledge of me .",72
"i was in some degree settled in my measures for carrying on the plantation before my kind friend , the captain of the ship that took me up at sea , went back — for the ship remained there , in providing his lading and preparing for his voyage , nearly three months — when telling him what little stock i had left behind me in london , he gave me this friendly and sincere advice:—“seignior inglese , ” says he ( for so he always called me ) , “ if you will give me letters , and a procuration in form to me , with orders to the person who has your money in london to send your effects to lisbon , to such persons as i shall direct , and in such goods as are proper for this country , i will bring you the produce of them , god willing , at my return ; but , since human affairs are all subject to changes and disasters , i would have you give orders but for one hundred pounds sterling , which , you say , is half your stock , and let the hazard be run for the first ; so that , if it come safe , you may order the rest the same way , and , if it miscarry , you may have the other half to have recourse to for your supply . ”",210
"in fact , in that part of the pacific , out of the course of vessels , it was to be feared that no help would ever come to them .",27
"i was positively against that ; and looking over the charts of the sea - coast of america with him , we concluded there was no inhabited country for us to have recourse to till we came within the circle of the caribbee islands , and therefore resolved to stand away for barbadoes ; which , by keeping off at sea , to avoid the indraft of the bay or gulf of mexico , we might easily perform , as we hoped , in about fifteen days ’ sail ; whereas we could not possibly make our voyage to the coast of africa without some assistance both to our ship and to ourselves .",36
"with this design we changed our course , and steered away n.w . by w. , in order to reach some of our english islands , where i hoped for relief . but our voyage was otherwise determined ; for , being in the latitude of twelve degrees eighteen minutes , a second storm came upon us , which carried us away with the same impetuosity westward , and drove us so out of the way of all human commerce , that , had all our lives been saved as to the sea , we were rather in danger of being devoured by savages than ever returning to our own country .",54

"" finally , adorned with emerald ribbons and dressed in velvet and silk , golden angelfish passed before our eyes like courtiers in the paintings of veronese ; spurred gilthead stole by with their swift thoracic fins ; thread herring fifteen inches long were wrapped in their phosphorescent glimmers ; gray mullet thrashed the sea with their big fleshy tails ; red salmon seemed to mow the waves with their slicing pectorals ; and silver moonfish , worthy of their name , rose on the horizon of the waters like the whitish reflections of many moons .",258
