"all the way , and in proportion as the corridors became more deserted , d’artagnan wished to stop the young woman , seize her and gaze upon her , were it only for a minute ; but quick as a bird she glided between his hands , and when he wished to speak to her , her finger placed upon her mouth , with a little imperative gesture full of grace , reminded him that he was under the command of a power which he must blindly obey , and which forbade him even to make the slightest complaint . at length , after winding about for a minute or two , mme . bonacieux opened the door of a closet , which was entirely dark , and led d’artagnan into it .",70
