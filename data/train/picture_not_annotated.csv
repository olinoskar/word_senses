""" i could not get rid of her . she brought me up to royalties , and people with stars and garters , and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and parrot noses . she spoke of me as her dearest friend . i had only met her once before , but she took it into her head to lionize me . i believe some picture of mine had made a great success at the time , at least had been chattered about in the penny newspapers , which is the nineteenth - century standard of immortality .",64
"there was a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy , and the blue cloud - shadows chased themselves across the grass like swallows . how pleasant it was in the garden ! and how delightful other people 's emotions were!-- much more delightful than their ideas , it seemed to him . one 's own soul , and the passions of one 's friends -- those were the fascinating things in life . he pictured to himself with silent amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long with basil hallward .",80

"yet it was watching him , with its beautiful marred face and its cruel smile . its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight . its blue eyes met his own . a sense of infinite pity , not for himself , but for the painted image of himself , came over him . it had altered already , and would alter more . its gold would wither into grey . its red and white roses would die . for every sin that he committed , a stain would fleck and wreck its fairness . but he would not sin . the picture , changed or unchanged , would be to him the visible emblem of conscience . he would resist temptation . he would not see lord henry any more -- would not , at any rate , listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in basil hallward 's garden had first stirred within him the passion for impossible things . he would go back to sibyl vane , make her amends , marry her , try to love her again . yes , it was his duty to do so . she must have suffered more than he had . poor child ! he had been selfish and cruel to her . the fascination that she had exercised over him would return . they would be happy together . his life with her would be beautiful and pure .",102

"as he often remembered afterwards , and always with no small wonder , he found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost scientific interest . that such a change should have taken place was incredible to him . and yet it was a fact . was there some subtle affinity between the chemical atoms that shaped themselves into form and colour on the canvas and the soul that was within him ? could it be that what that soul thought , they realized?--that what it dreamed , they made true ? or was there some other , more terrible reason ? he shuddered , and felt afraid , and , going back to the couch , lay there , gazing at the picture in sickened horror .",127
"i estimate -- but perhaps i 'm mistaken -- that the nautilus 's haphazard course continued for fifteen or twenty days , and i 'm not sure how long this would have gone on without the catastrophe that ended our voyage . as for captain nemo , he was no longer in the picture . as for his chief officer , the same applied . not one crewman was visible for a single instant . the nautilus cruised beneath the waters almost continuously . when it rose briefly to the surface to renew our air , the hatches opened and closed as if automated . no more positions were reported on the world map . i did n't know where we were .",53

"some thirty pictures by the masters , uniformly framed and separated by gleaming panoplies of arms , adorned walls on which were stretched tapestries of austere design . there i saw canvases of the highest value , the likes of which i had marveled at in private european collections and art exhibitions . the various schools of the old masters were represented by a raphael madonna , a virgin by leonardo da vinci , a nymph by correggio , a woman by titian , an adoration of the magi by veronese , an assumption of the virgin by murillo , a holbein portrait , a monk by velazquez , a martyr by ribera , a village fair by rubens , two flemish landscapes by teniers , three little genre paintings by gerard dow , metsu , and paul potter , two canvases by gericault and prud'hon , plus seascapes by backhuysen and vernet . among the works of modern art were pictures signed by delacroix , ingres , decamps , troyon , meissonier , daubigny , etc . , and some wonderful miniature statues in marble or bronze , modeled after antiquity 's finest originals , stood on their pedestals in the corners of this magnificent museum . as the nautilus 's commander had predicted , my mind was already starting to fall into that promised state of stunned amazement .",161

"sherlock holmes had , in a very remarkable degree , the power of detaching his mind at will . for two hours the strange business in which we had been involved appeared to be forgotten , and he was entirely absorbed in the pictures of the modern belgian masters . he would talk of nothing but art , of which he had the crudest ideas , from our leaving the gallery until we found ourselves at the northumberland hotel .",43

"no ; that was impossible . hour by hour , and week by week , the thing upon the canvas was growing old . it might escape the hideousness of sin , but the hideousness of age was in store for it . the cheeks would become hollow or flaccid . yellow crow 's feet would creep round the fading eyes and make them horrible . the hair would lose its brightness , the mouth would gape or droop , would be foolish or gross , as the mouths of old men are . there would be the wrinkled throat , the cold , blue - veined hands , the twisted body , that he remembered in the grandfather who had been so stern to him in his boyhood . the picture had to be concealed . there was no help for it .",131

"often , on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were his friends , or thought that they were so , he himself would creep upstairs to the locked room , open the door with the key that never left him now , and stand , with a mirror , in front of the portrait that basil hallward had painted of him , looking now at the evil and aging face on the canvas , and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him from the polished glass . the very sharpness of the contrast used to quicken his sense of pleasure . he grew more and more enamoured of his own beauty , more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul . he would examine with minute care , and sometimes with a monstrous and terrible delight , the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth , wondering sometimes which were the more horrible , the signs of sin or the signs of age . he would place his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture , and smile . he mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs .",205
