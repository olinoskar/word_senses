""",25
"as for captain nemo , i wondered what he would make of our escaping , what concern or perhaps what distress it might cause him , and what he would do in the twofold event of our attempt either failing or being found out ! certainly i had no complaints to register with him , on the contrary . never was hospitality more wholehearted than his . yet in leaving him i could n't be accused of ingratitude . no solemn promises bound us to him . in order to keep us captive , he had counted only on the force of circumstances and not on our word of honor . but his avowed intention to imprison us forever on his ship justified our every effort .",3
"then i began to wonder if this eccentric individual was even on board . since that night when the skiff had left the nautilus on some mysterious mission , my ideas about him had subtly changed . in spite of everything , i thought that captain nemo must have kept up some type of relationship with the shore . did he himself never leave the nautilus ? whole weeks had often gone by without my encountering him . what was he doing all the while ? during all those times i 'd thought he was convalescing in the grip of some misanthropic fit , was he instead far away from the ship , involved in some secret activity whose nature still eluded me ?",46
"as usual , dinner was served me in my stateroom . full of anxiety , i ate little . i left the table at seven o'clock . 120 minutes-- i was keeping track of them -- still separated me from the moment i was to rejoin ned land . my agitation increased . my pulse was throbbing violently . i could n't stand still . i walked up and down , hoping to calm my troubled mind with movement . the possibility of perishing in our reckless undertaking was the least of my worries ; my heart was pounding at the thought that our plans might be discovered before we had left the nautilus , at the thought of being hauled in front of captain nemo and finding him angered , or worse , saddened by my deserting him .",125
"crossing through the lounge , i arrived at the door , contrived in one of the canted corners , that opened into the captain 's stateroom . much to my astonishment , this door was ajar . i instinctively recoiled . if captain nemo was in his stateroom , he might see me . but , not hearing any sounds , i approached . the stateroom was deserted . i pushed the door open . i took a few steps inside . still the same austere , monastic appearance .",43
"what was the bond between these heroic souls and the soul of captain nemo ? from this collection of portraits could i finally unravel the mystery of his existence ? was he a fighter for oppressed peoples , a liberator of enslaved races ? had he figured in the recent political or social upheavals of this century ? was he a hero of that dreadful civil war in america , a war lamentable yet forever glorious . . . ?",13
"just then the door to the main lounge opened and captain nemo appeared . he saw me , and without further preamble :",11
""" well ? "" captain nemo went on . "" did you hear my question ? do you know the history of spain ? """,5
""" professor , "" captain nemo went on , "" if you 're amenable , we 'll go back in time to 1702 . you 're aware of the fact that in those days your king louis xiv thought an imperial gesture would suffice to humble the pyrenees in the dust , so he inflicted his grandson , the duke of anjou , on the spaniards . reigning more or less poorly under the name king philip v , this aristocrat had to deal with mighty opponents abroad .",5
""" are you clear on the chain of events ? "" captain nemo asked me .",12
captain nemo stopped . i admit it : i still could n't see how this piece of history concerned me .,1
""" well , professor aronnax , "" captain nemo answered me , "" we 're actually in that bay of vigo , and all that 's left is for you to probe the mysteries of the place . """,8
"i understood . this was the setting of that battle on october 22 , 1702 . here , in this very place , those galleons carrying treasure to the spanish government had gone to the bottom . here , whenever he needed , captain nemo came to withdraw these millions to ballast his nautilus . it was for him , for him alone , that america had yielded up its precious metals . he was the direct , sole heir to these treasures wrested from the incas and those peoples conquered by hernando cortez !",44
""" it was 500,000,000 francs , "" captain nemo replied , "" but no more ! """,8
no sooner had i voiced this regret than i felt it must have wounded captain nemo .,15
"captain nemo stopped on these last words , perhaps sorry that he had said too much . but i had guessed . whatever motives had driven him to seek independence under the seas , he remained a human being before all else ! his heart still throbbed for suffering humanity , and his immense philanthropy went out both to downtrodden races and to individuals !",1
"and now i knew where captain nemo had delivered those millions , when the nautilus navigated the waters where crete was in rebellion against the ottoman empire !",6
"near eleven o'clock in the evening , i received a most unexpected visit from captain nemo . he asked me very graciously if i felt exhausted from our vigil the night before . i said no .",15
"arriving at the wardrobe , i saw that neither my companions nor any crewmen would be coming with us on this excursion . captain nemo had n't even suggested my fetching ned or conseil .",24
"side by side , captain nemo and i walked directly toward this conspicuous flame . the level seafloor rose imperceptibly . we took long strides , helped by our alpenstocks ; but in general our progress was slow , because our feet kept sinking into a kind of slimy mud mixed with seaweed and assorted flat stones .",5
"meanwhile the reddish light guiding us had expanded and inflamed the horizon . the presence of this furnace under the waters had me extremely puzzled . was it some sort of electrical discharge ? was i approaching some natural phenomenon still unknown to scientists on shore ? or , rather ( and this thought did cross my mind ) , had the hand of man intervened in that blaze ? had human beings fanned those flames ? in these deep strata would i meet up with more of captain nemo 's companions , friends he was about to visit who led lives as strange as his own ? would i find a whole colony of exiles down here , men tired of the world 's woes , men who had sought and found independence in the ocean 's lower depths ? all these insane , inadmissible ideas dogged me , and in this frame of mind , continually excited by the series of wonders passing before my eyes , i would n't have been surprised to find on this sea bottom one of those underwater towns captain nemo dreamed about !",89

"in the midst of the stone mazes furrowing this atlantic seafloor , captain nemo moved forward without hesitation . he knew this dark path . no doubt he had often traveled it and was incapable of losing his way . i followed him with unshakeable confidence . he seemed like some spirit of the sea , and as he walked ahead of me , i marveled at his tall figure , which stood out in black against the glowing background of the horizon .",13
"but i could n't linger . captain nemo , on familiar terms with these dreadful animals , no longer minded them . we arrived at a preliminary plateau where still other surprises were waiting for me . there picturesque ruins took shape , betraying the hand of man , not our creator . they were huge stacks of stones in which you could distinguish the indistinct forms of palaces and temples , now arrayed in hosts of blossoming zoophytes , and over it all , not ivy but a heavy mantle of algae and fucus plants .",7
"but what part of the globe could this be , this land swallowed by cataclysms ? who had set up these rocks and stones like the dolmens of prehistoric times ? where was i , where had captain nemo 's fancies taken me ?",38
"in fact , there beneath my eyes was a town in ruins , demolished , overwhelmed , laid low , its roofs caved in , its temples pulled down , its arches dislocated , its columns stretching over the earth ; in these ruins you could still detect the solid proportions of a sort of tuscan architecture ; farther off , the remains of a gigantic aqueduct ; here , the caked heights of an acropolis along with the fluid forms of a parthenon ; there , the remnants of a wharf , as if some bygone port had long ago harbored merchant vessels and triple - tiered war galleys on the shores of some lost ocean ; still farther off , long rows of collapsing walls , deserted thoroughfares , a whole pompeii buried under the waters , which captain nemo had resurrected before my eyes !",141
"but captain nemo came over and stopped me with a gesture . then , picking up a piece of chalky stone , he advanced to a black basaltic rock and scrawled this one word :",2
"these were the historical memories that captain nemo 's scrawl sent rushing through my mind . thus , led by the strangest of fates , i was treading underfoot one of the mountains of that continent ! my hands were touching ruins many thousands of years old , contemporary with prehistoric times ! i was walking in the very place where contemporaries of early man had walked ! my heavy soles were crushing the skeletons of animals from the age of fable , animals that used to take cover in the shade of these trees now turned to stone !",7
"as i mused in this way , trying to establish in my memory every detail of this impressive landscape , captain nemo was leaning his elbows on a moss - covered monument , motionless as if petrified in some mute trance . was he dreaming of those lost generations , asking them for the secret of human destiny ? was it here that this strange man came to revive himself , basking in historical memories , reliving that bygone life , he who had no desire for our modern one ? i would have given anything to know his thoughts , to share them , understand them !",21
""" ah , captain nemo ! "" i replied . "" where are we ? """,4
"i set foot on the platform and waited . the darkness was so profound i could n't see even captain nemo . however , looking at the zenith directly overhead , i thought i caught sight of a feeble glimmer , a sort of twilight filtering through a circular hole . just then the beacon suddenly went on , and its intense brightness made that hazy light vanish .",20
"before more carefully examining the interior features of this enormous cavern , and before deciding if it was the work of nature or humankind , i went over to captain nemo .",30
""" indeed , "" i replied , "" here you 're in perfect safety , captain nemo . who could reach you in the heart of a volcano ? but do n't i see an opening at its summit ? """,16
"three - quarters of an hour later , we had completed our circular stroll and were back on board . just then the crewmen finished loading the sodium supplies , and the nautilus could have departed immediately . but captain nemo gave no orders . would he wait for nightfall and exit through his underwater passageway in secrecy ? perhaps . be that as it may , by the next day the nautilus had left its home port and was navigating well out from any shore , a few meters beneath the waves of the atlantic .",40
"the nautilus did n't change direction . for the time being , then , we had to set aside any hope of returning to european seas . captain nemo kept his prow pointing south . where was he taking us ? i was afraid to guess .",28
"such was the region our nautilus was visiting just then : a genuine prairie , a tightly woven carpet of algae , gulfweed , and bladder wrack so dense and compact a craft 's stempost could n't tear through it without difficulty . accordingly , not wanting to entangle his propeller in this weed - choked mass , captain nemo stayed at a depth some meters below the surface of the waves .",59
"from this moment on , for nineteen days from february 23 to march 12 , the nautilus stayed in the middle of the atlantic , hustling us along at a constant speed of 100 leagues every twenty - four hours . it was obvious that captain nemo wanted to carry out his underwater program , and i had no doubt that he intended , after doubling cape horn , to return to the pacific south seas .",46
"so ned land had good reason to worry . in these wide seas empty of islands , it was no longer feasible to jump ship . nor did we have any way to counter captain nemo 's whims . we had no choice but to acquiesce ; but if we could n't attain our end through force or cunning , i liked to think we might achieve it through persuasion . once this voyage was over , might not captain nemo consent to set us free in return for our promise never to reveal his existence ? our word of honor , which we sincerely would have kept . however , this delicate question would have to be negotiated with the captain . but how would he receive our demands for freedom ? at the very outset and in no uncertain terms , had n't he declared that the secret of his life required that we be permanently imprisoned on board the nautilus ? would n't he see my four - month silence as a tacit acceptance of this situation ? would my returning to this subject arouse suspicions that could jeopardize our escape plans , if we had promising circumstances for trying again later on ? i weighed all these considerations , turned them over in my mind , submitted them to conseil , but he was as baffled as i was . in short , although i 'm not easily discouraged , i realized that my chances of ever seeing my fellow men again were shrinking by the day , especially at a time when captain nemo was recklessly racing toward the south atlantic !",35

"captain nemo decided to take his nautilus down to the lowest depths in order to double - check these different soundings . i got ready to record the results of this experiment . the panels in the lounge opened , and maneuvers began for reaching those strata so prodigiously far removed .",1
"captain nemo decided to make for the ocean floor by submerging on an appropriately gradual diagonal with the help of his side fins , which were set at a 45 degrees angle to the nautilus 's waterline . then the propeller was brought to its maximum speed , and its four blades churned the waves with indescribable violence .",1
i asked captain nemo if he had observed any fish at more considerable depths .,3
""" just this , captain . in going toward the ocean 's lower strata , we know that vegetable life disappears more quickly than animal life . we know that moving creatures can still be encountered where water plants no longer grow . we know that oysters and pilgrim scallops live in 2,000 meters of water , and that admiral mcclintock , england 's hero of the polar seas , pulled in a live sea star from a depth of 2,500 meters . we know that the crew of the royal navy 's bulldog fished up a starfish from 2,620 fathoms , hence from a depth of more than one vertical league . would you still say , captain nemo , that we really know nothing ? """,119
""" oho ! we know that , do we ? "" captain nemo replied in a tone of mild surprise . "" well , professor , we have good reason to know it because it 's the truth . i might add , in fact , that the air bladders of fish contain more nitrogen than oxygen when these animals are caught at the surface of the water , and conversely , more oxygen than nitrogen when they 're pulled up from the lower depths . which bears out your formulation . but let 's continue our observations . """,12
""" would you like , "" captain nemo asked me , "" to bring back more than just a memory ? """,7
"before i had time to express the surprise this new proposition caused me , a camera was carried into the lounge at captain nemo 's request . the liquid setting , electrically lit , unfolded with perfect clarity through the wide - open panels . no shadows , no blurs , thanks to our artificial light . not even sunshine could have been better for our purposes . with the thrust of its propeller curbed by the slant of its fins , the nautilus stood still . the camera was aimed at the scenery on the ocean floor , and in a few seconds we had a perfect negative .",23
"meanwhile , his photographic operations over , captain nemo told me :",8
""" even so , "" he went on , "" captain nemo ca n't go south forever ! he 'll surely have to stop , if only at the ice bank , and he 'll return to the seas of civilization ! then it will be time to resume ned land 's plans . """,11

captain nemo observed the herd of cetaceans cavorting on the waters a mile from the nautilus .,1
""" hunt them ? what for ? "" captain nemo replied . "" simply to destroy them ? we have no use for whale oil on this ship . """,9
"i 'll let the reader decide what faces the canadian made during this lecture on hunting ethics . furnishing such arguments to a professional harpooner was a waste of words . ned land stared at captain nemo and obviously missed his meaning . but the captain was right . thanks to the mindless , barbaric bloodthirstiness of fishermen , the last baleen whale will someday disappear from the ocean .",36
"meanwhile captain nemo studied the herd of cetaceans , then addressed me :",2
""" wait and see , professor aronnax , "" captain nemo said . "" we 'll show you a style of hunting with which you are n't yet familiar . we 'll take no pity on these ferocious cetaceans . they 're merely mouth and teeth ! """,10
"there was just time to run to the rescue of the baleen whales . the nautilus proceeded to midwater . conseil , ned , and i sat in front of the lounge windows . captain nemo made his way to the helmsman 's side to operate his submersible as an engine of destruction . soon i felt the beats of our propeller getting faster , and we picked up speed .",35
captain nemo rejoined us .,1
"captain nemo guided the nautilus next to the animal 's corpse . two of his men climbed onto the whale 's flank , and to my astonishment , i saw them draw from its udders all the milk they held , in other words , enough to fill two or three casks .",1
"from that day on , i noted with some uneasiness that ned land 's attitudes toward captain nemo grew worse and worse , and i decided to keep a close watch on the canadian 's movements and activities .",17
"going along the 55th meridian , the nautilus cut the antarctic circle on march 16 near eight o'clock in the morning . ice completely surrounded us and closed off the horizon . nevertheless , captain nemo went from passageway to passageway , always proceeding south .",35
"often , no longer seeing any way out , i thought we were imprisoned for good , but captain nemo , guided by his instincts , discovered new passageways from the tiniest indications . he was never wrong when he observed slender threads of bluish water streaking through these ice fields . accordingly , i was sure that he had already risked his nautilus in the midst of the antarctic seas .",19
"however , during the day of march 16 , these tracts of ice completely barred our path . it was n't the ice bank as yet , just huge ice fields cemented together by the cold . this obstacle could n't stop captain nemo , and he launched his ship against the ice fields with hideous violence . the nautilus went into these brittle masses like a wedge , splitting them with dreadful cracklings . it was an old - fashioned battering ram propelled with infinite power . hurled aloft , ice rubble fell back around us like hail . through brute force alone , the submersible carved out a channel for itself . carried away by its momentum , the ship sometimes mounted on top of these tracts of ice and crushed them with its weight , or at other times , when cooped up beneath the ice fields , it split them with simple pitching movements , creating wide punctures .",43
"for ned land , as well as for every navigator before us , i knew that this was the great insurmountable obstacle . when the sun appeared for an instant near noon , captain nemo took a reasonably accurate sight that gave our position as longitude 51 degrees 30 ' and latitude 67 degrees 39 ' south . this was a position already well along in these antarctic regions .",34
""" well , professor , "" the canadian replied , "" you can just drop that idea ! you 've made it to the ice bank , which is already far enough , but you wo n't get any farther , neither your captain nemo or his nautilus . and whether he wants to or not , we 'll head north again , in other words , to the land of sensible people . """,44
"indeed , despite its efforts , despite the powerful methods it used to split this ice , the nautilus was reduced to immobility . ordinarily , when someone ca n't go any farther , he still has the option of returning in his tracks . but here it was just as impossible to turn back as to go forward , because every passageway had closed behind us , and if our submersible remained even slightly stationary , it would be frozen in without delay . which is exactly what happened near two o'clock in the afternoon , and fresh ice kept forming over the ship 's sides with astonishing speed . i had to admit that captain nemo 's leadership had been most injudicious .",117
"it then dawned on me to ask captain nemo if he had already discovered this pole , which no human being had ever trod underfoot .",8

""" i can see we 're starting to understand each other , professor , "" captain nemo told me with a half smile .

"about 300 meters down , just as captain nemo had predicted , we cruised beneath the undulating surface of the ice bank . but the nautilus sank deeper still . it reached a depth of 800 meters . at the surface this water gave a temperature of -12 degrees centigrade , but now it gave no more than -10 degrees . two degrees had already been gained . thanks to its heating equipment , the nautilus 's temperature , needless to say , stayed at a much higher degree . every maneuver was accomplished with extraordinary precision .",8

"one day , the 22nd of june , 1867 , these three men , who knew nothing of the past history of captain nemo , succeeded in escaping in one of the "" nautilus 's "" boats .",23

"captain nemo had picked an odd time to philosophize . all in all , this reply told me nothing .",1
"i mused on all the consequences of this situation . captain nemo did n't stop studying the pressure gauge . since the toppling of this iceberg , the nautilus had risen about 150 feet , but it still stayed at the same angle to the perpendicular .",11

possibly he would not have done this had he been aware that cyrus harding was sufficiently acquainted with his history to address him by the name of nemo .,27
"but captain nemo paid little attention ; his mind appeared to be absorbed by one idea , and without taking the proffered hand of the engineer,--",2

""" it was an enemy 's frigate , "" exclaimed captain nemo , transformed for an instant into the prince dakkar , "" an enemy 's frigate !",11
"after the works of art , natural rarities predominated . they consisted chiefly of plants , shells , and other exhibits from the ocean that must have been captain nemo 's own personal finds . in the middle of the lounge , a jet of water , electrically lit , fell back into a basin made from a single giant clam . the delicately festooned rim of this shell , supplied by the biggest mollusk in the class acephala , measured about six meters in circumference ; so it was even bigger than those fine giant clams given to king françois i by the republic of venice , and which the church of saint - sulpice in paris has made into two gigantic holy - water fonts .",29
"consequently , to calculate the value of this collection was , i should say , impossible . captain nemo must have spent millions in acquiring these different specimens , and i was wondering what financial resources he tapped to satisfy his collector 's fancies , when these words interrupted me :",18

"the hours passed . i often studied the instruments hanging on the lounge wall . the pressure gauge indicated that the nautilus stayed at a constant depth of 300 meters , the compass that it kept heading south , the log that it was traveling at a speed of twenty miles per hour , an excessive speed in such a cramped area . but captain nemo knew that by this point there was no such thing as too fast , since minutes were now worth centuries .",65

"captain nemo went out . hissing sounds soon told me that water was being admitted into the ballast tanks . the nautilus slowly settled and rested on the icy bottom at a depth of 350 meters , the depth at which the lower shelf of ice lay submerged .",1
"some moments later , we saw a dozen crewmen set foot on the shelf of ice , among them ned land , easily recognized by his tall figure . captain nemo was with them .",30
"at the far end stood a fourth watertight bulkhead , separating the crew 's quarters from the engine room . a door opened , and i stood in the compartment where captain nemo , indisputably a world - class engineer , had set up his locomotive equipment .",32

"work began immediately and was carried on with tireless tenacity . instead of digging all around the nautilus , which would have entailed even greater difficulties , captain nemo had an immense trench outlined on the ice , eight meters from our port quarter . then his men simultaneously staked it off at several points around its circumference . soon their picks were vigorously attacking this compact matter , and huge chunks were loosened from its mass . these chunks weighed less than the water , and by an unusual effect of specific gravity , each chunk took wing , as it were , to the roof of the tunnel , which thickened above by as much as it diminished below . but this hardly mattered so long as the lower surface kept growing thinner .",28

"i did n't tell my two companions about this new danger . there was no point in dampening the energy they were putting into our arduous rescue work . but when i returned on board , i mentioned this serious complication to captain nemo .",43
that evening captain nemo was forced to open the spigots of his air tanks and shoot a few spouts of fresh oxygen through the nautilus 's interior . without this precaution we would n't have awakened the following morning .,3
"supervising our work , working himself , captain nemo passed near me just then . i touched him with my hand and pointed to the walls of our prison . the starboard wall had moved forward to a point less than four meters from the nautilus 's hull .",8
"captain nemo had somewhat rallied from the prostration which had overcome him , and his eyes shone with their wonted fire .",1
"meanwhile , motionless and silent , captain nemo stood lost in thought . an idea visibly crossed his mind . but he seemed to brush it aside . he told himself no . at last these words escaped his lips :",7
"and yet nobody prolonged his underwater work beyond the time allotted him . his shift over , each man surrendered to a gasping companion the air tank that would revive him . captain nemo set the example and was foremost in submitting to this strict discipline . when his time was up , he yielded his equipment to another and reentered the foul air on board , always calm , unflinching , and uncomplaining .",33
"captain nemo spoke with winning eloquence . the fire in his eyes and the passion in his gestures transfigured him . yes , he loved his ship the same way a father loves his child !",1
"that day , the sixth of our imprisonment , captain nemo concluded that picks and mattocks were too slow to deal with the ice layer still separating us from open water -- and he decided to crush this layer . the man had kept his energy and composure . he had subdued physical pain with moral strength . he could still think , plan , and act .",10

"at length , shortly after midnight , captain nemo by a supreme effort succeeded in folding his arms across his breast , as if wishing in that attitude to compose himself for death .",8
"our strength returned promptly , and when i looked around , i saw that we were alone on the platform . no crewmen . not even captain nemo . those strange seamen on the nautilus were content with the oxygen circulating inside . not one of them had come up to enjoy the open air .",27
"cyrus harding , bending low closed the eyes of him who had once been the prince dakkar , and was now not even captain nemo .",24
"raising his sextant , captain nemo took the altitude of the sun , which would give him his latitude . he waited for a few minutes until the orb touched the rim of the horizon . while he was taking his sights , he did n't move a muscle , and the instrument could n't have been steadier in hands made out of marble .",5
"at length this vast effusion of electric light faded away , and soon after the "" nautilus , "" now the tomb of captain nemo , reposed in its ocean bed .",24
"i had no reply to this , and i feared that captain nemo would n't take us homeward but rather into that huge ocean washing the shores of both asia and america . in this way he would complete his underwater tour of the world , going back to those seas where the nautilus enjoyed the greatest freedom . but if we returned to the pacific , far from every populated shore , what would happen to ned land 's plans ?",12
"at break of day the colonists regained in silence the entrance of the cavern , to which they gave the name of "" dakkar grotto , "" in memory of captain nemo .",31
"by then all our past sufferings were forgotten . the memory of that imprisonment under the ice faded from our minds . we had thoughts only of the future . captain nemo no longer appeared , neither in the lounge nor on the platform . the positions reported each day on the world map were put there by the chief officer , and they enabled me to determine the nautilus 's exact heading . now then , that evening it became obvious , much to my satisfaction , that we were returning north by the atlantic route .",31
"meanwhile ned land , less dedicated to conchology , questioned me about my interview with captain nemo . had i discovered who he was , where he came from , where he was heading , how deep he was taking us ? in short , a thousand questions i had no time to answer .",16

"when the last tips of the falkland islands had disappeared below the horizon , the nautilus submerged to a depth between twenty and twenty - five meters and went along the south american coast . captain nemo did n't put in an appearance .",36
"for some days the nautilus kept veering away from the american coast . it obviously did n't want to frequent the waves of the gulf of mexico or the caribbean sea . yet there was no shortage of water under its keel , since the average depth of these seas is 1,800 meters ; but these waterways , strewn with islands and plowed by steamers , probably did n't agree with captain nemo .",72
"the canadian , conseil , and i had a pretty long conversation on this subject . for six months we had been prisoners aboard the nautilus . we had fared 17,000 leagues , and as ned land put it , there was no end in sight . so he made me a proposition i had n't anticipated . we were to ask captain nemo this question straight out : did the captain mean to keep us on board his vessel permanently ?",63
"so i begged ned to let me think about it before taking action . if this measure proved fruitless , it could arouse the captain 's suspicions , make our circumstances even more arduous , and jeopardize the canadian 's plans . i might add that i could hardly use our state of health as an argument . except for that grueling ordeal under the ice bank at the south pole , we had never felt better , neither ned , conseil , nor i. the nutritious food , life - giving air , regular routine , and uniform temperature kept illness at bay ; and for a man who did n't miss his past existence on land , for a captain nemo who was at home here , who went where he wished , who took paths mysterious to others if not himself in attaining his ends , i could understand such a life . but we ourselves had n't severed all ties with humanity . for my part , i did n't want my new and unusual research to be buried with my bones . i had now earned the right to pen the definitive book on the sea , and sooner or later i wanted that book to see the light of day .",122

"captain nemo reentered his stateroom , and i saw no more of him for a good while . but how sad , despairing , and irresolute he must have felt , to judge from this ship whose soul he was , which reflected his every mood ! the nautilus no longer kept to a fixed heading . it drifted back and forth , riding with the waves like a corpse . its propeller had been disentangled but was barely put to use . it was navigating at random . it could n't tear itself away from the setting of this last struggle , from this sea that had devoured one of its own !",1

"there the ocean floor formed a valley 120 kilometers wide , into which you could fit mt . blanc without its summit poking above the surface of the waves . this valley is closed off to the east by a sheer wall 2,000 meters high . we arrived there on may 28 , and the nautilus lay no farther than 150 kilometers from ireland . would captain nemo head up north and beach us on the british isles ? no . much to my surprise , he went back down south and returned to european seas . as we swung around the emerald isle , i spotted cape clear for an instant , plus the lighthouse on fastnet rock that guides all those thousands of ships setting out from glasgow or liverpool .",67
"an important question then popped into my head . would the nautilus dare to tackle the english channel ? ned land ( who promptly reappeared after we hugged shore ) never stopped questioning me . what could i answer him ? captain nemo remained invisible . after giving the canadian a glimpse of american shores , was he about to show me the coast of france ?",42
"the nautilus kept to its southeasterly heading . on december 1 it cut the equator at longitude 142 degrees , and on the 4th of the same month , after a quick crossing marked by no incident , we raised the marquesas islands . three miles off , in latitude 8 degrees 57 ' south and longitude 139 degrees 32 ' west , i spotted martin point on nuku hiva , chief member of this island group that belongs to france . i could make out only its wooded mountains on the horizon , because captain nemo hated to hug shore . there our nets brought up some fine fish samples : dolphinfish with azure fins , gold tails , and flesh that 's unrivaled in the entire world , wrasse from the genus hologymnosus that were nearly denuded of scales but exquisite in flavor , knifejaws with bony beaks , yellowish albacore that were as tasty as bonito , all fish worth classifying in the ship 's pantry .",96
"the next day , june 1 , the nautilus kept to the same tack . it was obviously trying to locate some precise spot in the ocean . just as on the day before , captain nemo came to take the altitude of the sun . the sea was smooth , the skies clear . eight miles to the east , a big steamship was visible on the horizon line . no flag was flapping from the gaff of its fore - and - aft sail , and i could n't tell its nationality .",36
"a few minutes before the sun passed its zenith , captain nemo raised his sextant and took his sights with the utmost precision . the absolute calm of the waves facilitated this operation . the nautilus lay motionless , neither rolling nor pitching .",11
"i was n't sure what to think , but next to me i heard captain nemo 's voice slowly say :",15
""" yes , sir ! the avenger ! a splendid name ! "" captain nemo murmured , crossing his arms .",14
"the day i expounded this theory to captain nemo , he answered me coldly :",8
"it was coming on fast . if captain nemo let it approach , a chance for salvation might be available to us .",8
"i had n't seen captain nemo for over a week , when , on the morning of the 27th , he entered the main lounge , as usual acting as if he 'd been gone for just five minutes . i was busy tracing the nautilus 's course on the world map . the captain approached , placed a finger over a position on the chart , and pronounced just one word :",5
"followed by captain nemo , i climbed onto the platform , and from there my eyes eagerly scanned the horizon .",3
just then captain nemo asked me what i knew about the shipwreck of the count de la pérouse .,3
"by then the ironclad was no more than three miles off . despite its violent cannonade , captain nemo had n't appeared on the platform . and yet if one of those conical shells had scored a routine hit on the nautilus 's hull , it could have been fatal to him .",18
"dreadful to hear , captain nemo was even more dreadful to see . his face was pale from some spasm of his heart , which must have stopped beating for an instant . his pupils were hideously contracted . his voice was no longer speaking , it was bellowing . bending from the waist , he shook the canadian by the shoulders .",5
"and in the bow of the platform , captain nemo unfurled a black flag , like the one he had left planted at the south pole .",9
"captain nemo shrugged his shoulders . then , addressing me :",1
""" i will , "" captain nemo replied icily . "" you 're ill - advised to pass judgment on me , sir . fate has shown you what you were n't meant to see . the attack has come . our reply will be dreadful . get back inside ! """,6
"i repaired to my stateroom . the captain and his chief officer stayed on the platform . the propeller was set in motion . the nautilus swiftly retreated , putting us outside the range of the vessel 's shells . but the chase continued , and captain nemo was content to keep his distance .",47
this is the substance of the account i gave captain nemo .,10
i tried to intervene one last time . but i had barely queried captain nemo when the latter silenced me :,14
"captain nemo did n't reply but signaled me to follow him to the main lounge . the nautilus sank a few meters beneath the waves , and the panels opened .",1
"and as i stared at this desolate wreckage , captain nemo told me in a solemn voice :",10
"captain nemo showed me a tin box , stamped with the coat of arms of france and all corroded by salt water . he opened it and i saw a bundle of papers , yellowed but still legible .",1
""" ah , what a splendid death for a seaman ! "" captain nemo then said . "" a coral grave is a tranquil grave , and may heaven grant that my companions and i rest in no other ! """,13
"at three o'clock in the morning , full of uneasiness , i climbed onto the platform . captain nemo had n't left it . he stood in the bow next to his flag , which a mild breeze was unfurling above his head . his eyes never left that vessel . the extraordinary intensity of his gaze seemed to attract it , beguile it , and draw it more surely than if he had it in tow !",18
"i stood there until six o'clock in the morning , captain nemo never seeming to notice me . the vessel lay a mile and a half off , and with the first glimmers of daylight , it resumed its cannonade . the time could n't be far away when the nautilus would attack its adversary , and my companions and i would leave forever this man i dared not judge .",11
""" besides , mr . nemo really lives up to his latin name , since he could n't be less in the way if he did n't exist . """,5
"captain nemo was there . mute , gloomy , implacable , he was staring through the port panel .",1
"on january 4 , two days after crossing the coral sea , we raised the coast of papua . on this occasion captain nemo told me that he intended to reach the indian ocean via the torres strait . this was the extent of his remarks . ned saw with pleasure that this course would bring us , once again , closer to european seas .",23
"the torres strait is about thirty - four leagues wide , but it 's obstructed by an incalculable number of islands , islets , breakers , and rocks that make it nearly impossible to navigate . consequently , captain nemo took every desired precaution in crossing it . floating flush with the water , the nautilus moved ahead at a moderate pace . like a cetacean 's tail , its propeller churned the waves slowly .",39
"taking advantage of this situation , my two companions and i found seats on the ever - deserted platform . in front of us stood the pilothouse , and unless i 'm extremely mistaken , captain nemo must have been inside , steering his nautilus himself .",36
"i turned to captain nemo . this dreadful executioner , this true archangel of hate , was still staring . when it was all over , captain nemo headed to the door of his stateroom , opened it , and entered . i followed him with my eyes .",4
"i turned to captain nemo . this dreadful executioner , this true archangel of hate , was still staring . when it was all over , captain nemo headed to the door of his stateroom , opened it , and entered . i followed him with my eyes .",27
""" master , "" asked neb , a few days later , "" do you think all this could have happened if captain nemo had been still alive ? """,23
"on the rear paneling , beneath the portraits of his heroes , i saw the portrait of a still - youthful woman with two little children . captain nemo stared at them for a few moments , stretched out his arms to them , sank to his knees , and melted into sobs .",28
the last words of captain nemo,5
"i reentered my stateroom , where ned and conseil were waiting silently . captain nemo filled me with insurmountable horror . whatever he had once suffered at the hands of humanity , he had no right to mete out such punishment . he had made me , if not an accomplice , at least an eyewitness to his vengeance ! even this was intolerable .",14
"i was already wondering if captain nemo , rash to the point of sheer insanity , wanted his ship to tackle the narrows where dumont d'urville 's two sloops of war had gone aground , when he changed direction a second time and cut straight to the west , heading toward gueboroa island .",6
"when i stood up , i saw captain nemo and his chief officer on the platform . they were examining the ship 's circumstances , exchanging a few words in their incomprehensible dialect .",8
"here is what those circumstances entailed . two miles to starboard lay gueboroa island , its coastline curving north to west like an immense arm . to the south and east , heads of coral were already on display , left uncovered by the ebbing waters . we had run aground at full tide and in one of those seas whose tides are moderate , an inconvenient state of affairs for floating the nautilus off . however , the ship had n't suffered in any way , so solidly joined was its hull . but although it could neither sink nor split open , it was in serious danger of being permanently attached to these reefs , and that would have been the finish of captain nemo 's submersible .",126
"i estimate -- but perhaps i 'm mistaken -- that the nautilus 's haphazard course continued for fifteen or twenty days , and i 'm not sure how long this would have gone on without the catastrophe that ended our voyage . as for captain nemo , he was no longer in the picture . as for his chief officer , the same applied . not one crewman was visible for a single instant . the nautilus cruised beneath the waters almost continuously . when it rose briefly to the surface to renew our air , the hatches opened and closed as if automated . no more positions were reported on the world map . i did n't know where we were .",45
captain nemo gave me an odd look and gestured no . which told me pretty clearly that nothing would ever force him to set foot on a land mass again . then he said :,1
""" even so , captain nemo , "" i went on , ignoring his ironic turn of phrase , "" the nautilus has run aground at a moment when the sea is full . now then , the tides are n't strong in the pacific , and if you ca n't unballast the nautilus , which seems impossible to me , i do n't see how it will float off . """,5
"this said , captain nemo went below again to the nautilus 's interior , followed by his chief officer . as for our craft , it no longer stirred , staying as motionless as if these coral polyps had already walled it in with their indestructible cement .",4
""" sir , "" he answered , "" you can trust me when i say this hunk of iron will never navigate again , on the seas or under them . it 's only fit to be sold for its weight . so i think it 's time we gave captain nemo the slip . """,51
""" in this instance our friend ned is right , "" conseil said , "" and i side with his views . could n't master persuade his friend captain nemo to send the three of us ashore , if only so our feet do n't lose the knack of treading on the solid parts of our planet ? """,29
"the skiff was put at our disposal for the next morning . i hardly needed to ask whether captain nemo would be coming along . i likewise assumed that no crewmen would be assigned to us , that ned land would be in sole charge of piloting the longboat . besides , the shore lay no more than two miles off , and it would be child 's play for the canadian to guide that nimble skiff through those rows of reefs so ill - fated for big ships .",19
"i took one last look at the natural wonders and artistic treasures amassed in the museum , this unrivaled collection doomed to perish someday in the depths of the seas , together with its curator . i wanted to establish one supreme impression in my mind . i stayed there an hour , basking in the aura of the ceiling lights , passing in review the treasures shining in their glass cases . then i returned to my stateroom . there i dressed in sturdy seafaring clothes . i gathered my notes and packed them tenderly about my person . my heart was pounding mightily . i could n't curb its pulsations . my anxiety and agitation would certainly have given me away if captain nemo had seen me .",125
"what was he doing just then ? i listened at the door to his stateroom . i heard the sound of footsteps . captain nemo was inside . he had n't gone to bed . with his every movement i imagined he would appear and ask me why i wanted to escape ! i felt in a perpetual state of alarm . my imagination magnified this sensation . the feeling became so acute , i wondered whether it would n't be better to enter the captain 's stateroom , dare him face to face , brave it out with word and deed !",24
"it was an insane idea . fortunately i controlled myself and stretched out on the bed to soothe my bodily agitation . my nerves calmed a little , but with my brain so aroused , i did a swift review of my whole existence aboard the nautilus , every pleasant or unpleasant incident that had crossed my path since i went overboard from the abraham lincoln : the underwater hunting trip , the torres strait , our running aground , the savages of papua , the coral cemetery , the suez passageway , the island of santorini , the cretan diver , the bay of vigo , atlantis , the ice bank , the south pole , our imprisonment in the ice , the battle with the devilfish , the storm in the gulf stream , the avenger , and that horrible scene of the vessel sinking with its crew . . . ! all these events passed before my eyes like backdrops unrolling upstage in a theater . in this strange setting captain nemo then grew fantastically . his features were accentuated , taking on superhuman proportions . he was no longer my equal , he was the man of the waters , the spirit of the seas .",174
"just then i heard indistinct chords from the organ , melancholy harmonies from some undefinable hymn , actual pleadings from a soul trying to sever its earthly ties . i listened with all my senses at once , barely breathing , immersed like captain nemo in this musical trance that was drawing him beyond the bounds of this world .",44
"then a sudden thought terrified me . captain nemo had left his stateroom . he was in the same lounge i had to cross in order to escape . there i would encounter him one last time . he would see me , perhaps speak to me ! one gesture from him could obliterate me , a single word shackle me to his vessel !",8
"even so , ten o'clock was about to strike . it was time to leave my stateroom and rejoin my companions . i dared not hesitate , even if captain nemo stood before me . i opened the door cautiously , but as it swung on its hinges , it seemed to make a frightful noise . this noise existed , perhaps , only in my imagination !",30
"i crept forward through the nautilus 's dark gangways , pausing after each step to curb the pounding of my heart . i arrived at the corner door of the lounge . i opened it gently . the lounge was plunged in profound darkness . chords from the organ were reverberating faintly . captain nemo was there . he did n't see me . even in broad daylight i doubt that he would have noticed me , so completely was he immersed in his trance .",54
"stepping ashore had an exhilarating effect on me . ned land tested the soil with his foot , as if he were laying claim to it . yet it had been only two months since we had become , as captain nemo expressed it , "" passengers on the nautilus , "" in other words , the literal prisoners of its commander .",41
""" captain nemo did right to die , "" said neb .",2
""" and i do n't think , "" the canadian said , "" that your nemo would object to us stashing a cargo of coconuts aboard his vessel ? """,15
"but what happened to the nautilus ? did it withstand the maelstrom 's clutches ? is captain nemo alive ? is he still under the ocean pursuing his frightful program of revenge , or did he stop after that latest mass execution ? will the waves someday deliver that manuscript that contains his full life story ? will i finally learn the man 's name ? will the nationality of the stricken warship tell us the nationality of captain nemo ?",17

"the colonists uncovered themselves at these last words of cyrus harding , and murmured the name of captain nemo .",18
robert grant was now made acquainted with the strange history of captain nemo and the colonists of lincoln island .,12
"of the treasures contained in the coffer left by captain nemo to the colonists of lincoln island , the larger portion was employed in the purchase of a vast territory in the state of iowa .",10
"there cyrus harding and his companions received at intervals visits from lord and lady glenarvan , captain john mangles and his wife , the sister of robert grant , robert grant himself , major mcnab , and all those who had taken part in the history both of captain grant and captain nemo .",52
"there , to conclude , all were happy , united in the present as they had been in the past ; but never could they forget that island upon which they had arrived poor and friendless , that island which , during four years had supplied all their wants , and of which there remained but a fragment of granite washed by the waves of the pacific , the tomb of him who had borne the name of captain nemo .",79
the lightning bolts of captain nemo,5
"i went below to the lounge , from which some chords were wafting . captain nemo was there , leaning over the organ , deep in a musical trance .",15
""" professor aronnax , "" replied captain nemo , whose fingers took their places again on the organ keys , "" if every islander in papua were to gather on that beach , the nautilus would still have nothing to fear from their attacks ! """,7
"having nothing better to do , i decided to dredge these beautiful , clear waters , which exhibited a profusion of shells , zoophytes , and open - sea plants . besides , it was the last day the nautilus would spend in these waterways , if , tomorrow , it still floated off to the open sea as captain nemo had promised .",60
""" we 've got to alert captain nemo , "" i said , reentering the hatch .",7

""" nothing easier , "" captain nemo said . and he pressed an electric button , transmitting an order to the crew 's quarters .",6
"on this note i was about to withdraw ; but captain nemo detained me and invited me to take a seat next to him . he questioned me with interest on our excursions ashore and on our hunting , but seemed not to understand the canadian 's passionate craving for red meat . then our conversation skimmed various subjects , and without being more forthcoming , captain nemo proved more affable .",11

"pronouncing these words in an extremely sharp tone , captain nemo gave me a curt bow . this was my dismissal , and i reentered my stateroom . there i found conseil , who wanted to know the upshot of my interview with the captain .",10
i worked in my stateroom until noon without seeing captain nemo even for an instant . nobody on board seemed to be making any preparations for departure .,10
"i still waited for a while , then i made my way to the main lounge . its timepiece marked 2:30 . in ten minutes the tide would reach its maximum elevation , and if captain nemo had n't made a rash promise , the nautilus would immediately break free . if not , many months might pass before it could leave its coral bed .",36
at 2:35 captain nemo appeared in the lounge .,3
""" what about them ? "" captain nemo replied , with a light shrug of his shoulders .",7
""" professor aronnax , "" captain nemo replied serenely , "" the nautilus 's hatches are n't to be entered in that fashion even when they 're open . """,6
"on january 13 , arriving in the timor sea , captain nemo raised the island of that name at longitude 122 degrees . this island , whose surface area measures 1,625 square leagues , is governed by rajahs . these aristocrats deem themselves the sons of crocodiles , in other words , descendants with the most exalted origins to which a human being can lay claim . accordingly , their scaly ancestors infest the island 's rivers and are the subjects of special veneration . they are sheltered , nurtured , flattered , pampered , and offered a ritual diet of nubile maidens ; and woe to the foreigner who lifts a finger against these sacred saurians .",11
"after our position fix , the nautilus 's latitude bearings were modulated to the southwest . our prow pointed to the indian ocean . where would captain nemo 's fancies take us ? would he head up to the shores of asia ? would he pull nearer to the beaches of europe ? unlikely choices for a man who avoided populated areas ! so would he go down south ? would he double the cape of good hope , then cape horn , and push on to the antarctic pole ? finally , would he return to the seas of the pacific , where his nautilus could navigate freely and easily ? time would tell .",27
"be that as it may , captain nemo also introduced me to the different data he had obtained on the relative densities of the water in our globe 's chief seas . from this news i derived some personal enlightenment having nothing to do with science .",7
"for several days our work hours were spent in all sorts of experiments , on the degree of salinity in waters of different depths , or on their electric properties , coloration , and transparency , and in every instance captain nemo displayed an ingenuity equaled only by his graciousness toward me . then i saw no more of him for some days and again lived on board in seclusion .",41
"i had climbed onto the platform just as the chief officer was taking his readings of hour angles . out of habit i waited for him to pronounce his daily phrase . but that day it was replaced by a different phrase , just as incomprehensible . almost at once i saw captain nemo appear , lift his spyglass , and inspect the horizon .",53
"meanwhile captain nemo strolled from one end of the platform to the other , not glancing at me , perhaps not even seeing me . his step was firm but less regular than usual . sometimes he would stop , cross his arms over his chest , and observe the sea . what could he be looking for over that immense expanse ? by then the nautilus lay hundreds of miles from the nearest coast !",2
"but this mystery would inevitably be cleared up , and soon , because captain nemo gave orders to increase speed ; at once the engine stepped up its drive power , setting the propeller in swifter rotation .",14
"i spun around . captain nemo was standing before me , but i almost did n't recognize him . his facial features were transfigured . gleaming with dark fire , his eyes had shrunk beneath his frowning brow . his teeth were half bared . his rigid body , clenched fists , and head drawn between his shoulders , all attested to a fierce hate breathing from every pore . he did n't move . my spyglass fell from his hand and rolled at his feet .",5
"finally captain nemo regained his self - control . his facial appearance , so profoundly changed , now resumed its usual calm . he addressed a few words to his chief officer in their strange language , then he turned to me :",2
"then i sank into deep speculation , and captain nemo 's strange facial seizure kept haunting me . i was incapable of connecting two ideas in logical order , and i had strayed into the most absurd hypotheses , when i was snapped out of my mental struggles by these words from ned land : "" well , look here ! lunch is served ! """,9
"indeed , the table had been laid . apparently captain nemo had given this order at the same time he commanded the nautilus to pick up speed .",10
"as for captain nemo , he did n't appear . of the other men on board , i saw only my emotionless steward , who served me with his usual mute efficiency .",3
"my reply obviously pleased captain nemo . but not knowing what he was driving at , i waited for further questions , ready to reply as circumstances dictated .",5
"captain nemo clenched his fists , and tears slid from his eyes , which i had thought incapable of weeping .",1
""" you may go , professor aronnax , "" captain nemo told me .",10
"the next morning i climbed on deck . captain nemo was already there . as soon as he saw me , he came over .",9
"as for the dead or dying man , he had n't come into the picture . i rejoined ned land and conseil . i informed them of captain nemo 's proposition . conseil was eager to accept , and this time the canadian proved perfectly amenable to going with us .",28
"it was eight o'clock in the morning . by 8:30 we were suited up for this new stroll and equipped with our two devices for lighting and breathing . the double door opened , and accompanied by captain nemo with a dozen crewmen following , we set foot on the firm seafloor where the nautilus was resting , ten meters down .",38
"a gentle slope gravitated to an uneven bottom whose depth was about fifteen fathoms . this bottom was completely different from the one i had visited during my first excursion under the waters of the pacific ocean . here i saw no fine - grained sand , no underwater prairies , not one open - sea forest . i immediately recognized the wondrous region in which captain nemo did the honors that day . it was the coral realm .",67
"but as the bushes shrank , the tree forms magnified . actual petrified thickets and long alcoves from some fantastic school of architecture kept opening up before our steps . captain nemo entered beneath a dark gallery whose gentle slope took us to a depth of 100 meters . the light from our glass coils produced magical effects at times , lingering on the wrinkled roughness of some natural arch , or some overhang suspended like a chandelier , which our lamps flecked with fiery sparks . amid these shrubs of precious coral , i observed other polyps no less unusual : melita coral , rainbow coral with jointed outgrowths , then a few tufts of genus corallina , some green and others red , actually a type of seaweed encrusted with limestone salts , which , after long disputes , naturalists have finally placed in the vegetable kingdom . but as one intellectual has remarked , "" here , perhaps , is the actual point where life rises humbly out of slumbering stone , but without breaking away from its crude starting point . """,31
"meanwhile captain nemo had called a halt . my companions and i stopped walking , and turning around , i saw the crewmen form a semicircle around their leader . looking with greater care , i observed that four of them were carrying on their shoulders an object that was oblong in shape .",2
"at a signal from captain nemo , one of his men stepped forward and , a few feet from this cross , detached a mattock from his belt and began to dig a hole .",5
"i finally understood ! this clearing was a cemetery , this hole a grave , that oblong object the body of the man who must have died during the night ! captain nemo and his men had come to bury their companion in this communal resting place on the inaccessible ocean floor !",32
"then the pallbearers approached . wrapped in white fabric made from filaments of the fan mussel , the body was lowered into its watery grave . captain nemo , arms crossed over his chest , knelt in a posture of prayer , as did all the friends of him who had loved them . . . . my two companions and i bowed reverently .",27
captain nemo rejoined me . i stood up and said to him :,1
""" yes , professor aronnax , "" captain nemo replied .",8
"as for me , i was no longer content with the hypotheses that satisfied conseil . that fine lad persisted in seeing the nautilus 's commander as merely one of those unappreciated scientists who repay humanity 's indifference with contempt . for conseil , the captain was still a misunderstood genius who , tired of the world 's deceptions , had been driven to take refuge in this inaccessible environment where he was free to follow his instincts . but to my mind , this hypothesis explained only one side of captain nemo .",92
"in fact , the mystery of that last afternoon when we were locked in prison and put to sleep , the captain 's violent precaution of snatching from my grasp a spyglass poised to scour the horizon , and the fatal wound given that man during some unexplained collision suffered by the nautilus , all led me down a plain trail . no ! captain nemo was n't content simply to avoid humanity ! his fearsome submersible served not only his quest for freedom , but also , perhaps , it was used in lord - knows - what schemes of dreadful revenge .",65
"while he took his sights with his sextant , one of the nautilus 's sailors-- that muscular man who had gone with us to crespo island during our first underwater excursion -- came up to clean the glass panes of the beacon . i then examined the fittings of this mechanism , whose power was increased a hundredfold by biconvex lenses that were designed like those in a lighthouse and kept its rays productively focused . this electric lamp was so constructed as to yield its maximum illuminating power . in essence , its light was generated in a vacuum , insuring both its steadiness and intensity . such a vacuum also reduced wear on the graphite points between which the luminous arc expanded . this was an important savings for captain nemo , who could n't easily renew them . but under these conditions , wear and tear were almost nonexistent .",132
"on the morning of the 24th , in latitude 12 degrees 5 ' south and longitude 94 degrees 33 ' , we raised keeling island , a madreporic upheaving planted with magnificent coconut trees , which had been visited by mr . darwin and captain fitzroy . the nautilus cruised along a short distance off the shore of this desert island . our dragnets brought up many specimens of polyps and echinoderms plus some unusual shells from the branch mollusca . captain nemo 's treasures were enhanced by some valuable exhibits from the delphinula snail species , to which i joined some pointed star coral , a sort of parasitic polypary that often attaches itself to seashells .",82

"captain nemo , conseil , ned land , and i found seats in the stern of the skiff . the longboat 's coxswain took the tiller ; his four companions leaned into their oars ; the moorings were cast off and we pulled clear .",1
"we were silent . what was captain nemo thinking ? perhaps that this approaching shore was too close for comfort , contrary to the canadian 's views in which it still seemed too far away . as for conseil , he had come along out of simple curiosity .",7
"near 5:30 the first glimmers of light on the horizon defined the upper lines of the coast with greater distinctness . fairly flat to the east , it swelled a little toward the south . five miles still separated it from us , and its beach merged with the misty waters . between us and the shore , the sea was deserted . not a boat , not a diver . profound solitude reigned over this gathering place of pearl fishermen . as captain nemo had commented , we were arriving in these waterways a month too soon .",84
"the skiff advanced toward mannar island , which curved to the south . captain nemo stood up from his thwart and studied the sea .",14
""" here we are , professor aronnax , "" captain nemo then said . "" you observe this confined bay ? a month from now in this very place , the numerous fishing boats of the harvesters will gather , and these are the waters their divers will ransack so daringly . this bay is felicitously laid out for their type of fishing . it 's sheltered from the strongest winds , and the sea is never very turbulent here , highly favorable conditions for diving work . now let 's put on our underwater suits , and we 'll begin our stroll . """,10
"i did n't reply , and while staring at these suspicious waves , i began to put on my heavy aquatic clothes , helped by the longboat 's sailors . captain nemo and my two companions suited up as well . none of the nautilus 's men were to go with us on this new excursion .",31
"as captain nemo pronounced these words , i turned to conseil and ned land . but my two friends had already encased their craniums in their metal headgear , and they could neither hear nor reply .",2
i had one question left to address to captain nemo .,9
"an instant later , the longboat 's sailors helped us overboard one after the other , and we set foot on level sand in a meter and a half of water . captain nemo gave us a hand signal . we followed him down a gentle slope and disappeared under the waves .",33
"captain nemo pointed to this prodigious heap of shellfish , and i saw that these mines were genuinely inexhaustible , since nature 's creative powers are greater than man 's destructive instincts . true to those instincts , ned land greedily stuffed the finest of these mollusks into a net he carried at his side .",1
"captain nemo went in . we followed him . my eyes soon grew accustomed to this comparative gloom . i distinguished the unpredictably contoured springings of a vault , supported by natural pillars firmly based on a granite foundation , like the weighty columns of tuscan architecture . why had our incomprehensible guide taken us into the depths of this underwater crypt ? i would soon find out .",1
"after going down a fairly steep slope , our feet trod the floor of a sort of circular pit . there captain nemo stopped , and his hand indicated an object that i had n't yet noticed . it was an oyster of extraordinary dimensions , a titanic giant clam , a holy - water font that could have held a whole lake , a basin more than two meters wide , hence even bigger than the one adorning the nautilus 's lounge .",22
"captain nemo was obviously familiar with this bivalve 's existence . this was n't the first time he 'd paid it a visit , and i thought his sole reason for leading us to this locality was to show us a natural curiosity . i was mistaken . captain nemo had an explicit personal interest in checking on the current condition of this giant clam .",1
"captain nemo was obviously familiar with this bivalve 's existence . this was n't the first time he 'd paid it a visit , and i thought his sole reason for leading us to this locality was to show us a natural curiosity . i was mistaken . captain nemo had an explicit personal interest in checking on the current condition of this giant clam .",49
"i then understood captain nemo 's intent . by leaving the pearl buried beneath the giant clam 's mantle , he allowed it to grow imperceptibly . with each passing year the mollusk 's secretions added new concentric layers . the captain alone was familiar with the cave where this wonderful fruit of nature was "" ripening "" ; he alone reared it , so to speak , in order to transfer it one day to his dearly beloved museum . perhaps , following the examples of oyster farmers in china and india , he had even predetermined the creation of this pearl by sticking under the mollusk 's folds some piece of glass or metal that was gradually covered with mother - of - pearl . in any case , comparing this pearl to others i already knew about , and to those shimmering in the captain 's collection , i estimated that it was worth at least 10,000,000 francs . it was a superb natural curiosity rather than a luxurious piece of jewelry , because i do n't know of any female ear that could handle it .",4
"our visit to this opulent giant clam came to an end . captain nemo left the cave , and we climbed back up the bank of shellfish in the midst of these clear waters not yet disturbed by divers at work .",13
"ten minutes later , captain nemo stopped suddenly . i thought he 'd called a halt so that we could turn and start back . no . with a gesture he ordered us to crouch beside him at the foot of a wide crevice . his hand motioned toward a spot within the liquid mass , and i looked carefully .",5
"this scene lasted barely a few seconds . the shark returned , rolled over on its back , and was getting ready to cut the indian in half , when captain nemo , who was stationed beside me , suddenly stood up . then he strode right toward the monster , dagger in hand , ready to fight it at close quarters .",31
"i can see captain nemo 's bearing to this day . bracing himself , he waited for the fearsome man - eater with wonderful composure , and when the latter rushed at him , the captain leaped aside with prodigious quickness , avoided a collision , and sank his dagger into its belly . but that was n't the end of the story . a dreadful battle was joined .",4
"captain nemo 's first concern was to revive this unfortunate man . i was n't sure he would succeed . i hoped so , since the poor devil had n't been under very long . but that stroke from the shark 's tail could have been his deathblow .",1
"and above all , what must he have thought when captain nemo pulled a bag of pearls from a pocket in his diving suit and placed it in the fisherman 's hands ? this magnificent benefaction from the man of the waters to the poor indian from ceylon was accepted by the latter with trembling hands . his bewildered eyes indicated that he did n't know to what superhuman creatures he owed both his life and his fortune .",11
captain nemo 's first words were spoken to the canadian .,1
""" in its appointed time . meanwhile there 's nothing we can do about it , and our discussions are futile . my gallant ned , if you come and tell me , ' a chance to escape is available to us , ' then i 'll discuss it with you . but that is n't the case , and in all honesty , i do n't think captain nemo ever ventures into european seas . """,69
"i was convinced that when captain nemo reached this point , he would back out again ; but i was mistaken , and much to my surprise , he did nothing of the sort .",6
"i would not even attempt to understand the whim that induced captain nemo to take us into this gulf . but i wholeheartedly approved of the nautilus 's entering it . it adopted a medium pace , sometimes staying on the surface , sometimes diving to avoid some ship , and so i could observe both the inside and topside of this highly unusual sea .",12
"at noon that day after our position fix , captain nemo climbed onto the platform , where i happened to be . i vowed not to let him go below again without at least sounding him out on his future plans . as soon as he saw me , he came over , graciously offered me a cigar , and said to me :",10
""" yes , captain nemo , "" i replied , "" and the nautilus is wonderfully suited to this whole survey . ah , it 's a clever boat ! """,4
captain nemo did not reply . after some minutes of silence :,1
""" an artistic explanation , captain nemo , "" i replied , "" but i 'm unable to rest content with it . so i 'll ask you for your own personal views . """,6
""" hence , captain nemo , this is n't the first time you 've gone through the red sea aboard the nautilus ? """,4
""" yes , all hail to that great french citizen , "" i replied , quite startled by how emphatically captain nemo had just spoken .",21
""" surely , "" captain nemo replied serenely . "" under that tongue of land , nature long ago made what man today is making on its surface . """,5
i ignored this innuendo and waited for captain nemo 's explanation .,8
just then captain nemo appeared on the platform . he spotted the dugong . he understood the canadian 's frame of mind and addressed him directly :,3
""" then proceed , mr . land , "" captain nemo replied .",10
"at six o'clock , sometimes afloat and sometimes submerged , the nautilus passed well out from el tur , which sat at the far end of a bay whose waters seemed to be dyed red , as captain nemo had already mentioned . then night fell in the midst of a heavy silence occasionally broken by the calls of pelicans and nocturnal birds , by the sound of surf chafing against rocks , or by the distant moan of a steamer churning the waves of the gulf with noisy blades .",38
"at 9:15 when our boat returned to the surface , i climbed onto the platform . i was quite impatient to clear captain nemo 's tunnel , could n't sit still , and wanted to breathe the fresh night air .",23
"i followed captain nemo . the hatch closed , the ballast tanks filled with water , and the submersible sank some ten meters down .",3
"captain nemo led me to the central companionway . in midstair he opened a door , went along the upper gangways , and arrived at the wheelhouse , which , as you know , stands at one end of the platform .",1
"at 10:15 captain nemo himself took the helm . dark and deep , a wide gallery opened ahead of us . the nautilus was brazenly swallowed up . strange rumblings were audible along our sides . it was the water of the red sea , hurled toward the mediterranean by the tunnel 's slope . our engines tried to offer resistance by churning the waves with propeller in reverse , but the nautilus went with the torrent , as swift as an arrow .",3
at 10:35 captain nemo left the steering wheel and turned to me :,3
""" what 's more , ned , "" i said , "" captain nemo himself did the honors in his tunnel , and i stood beside him in the pilothouse while he steered the nautilus through that narrow passageway . """,13
""" what i 've got to tell you is very simple , "" the canadian replied . "" we 're in europe , and before captain nemo 's whims take us deep into the polar seas or back to oceania , i say we should leave this nautilus . """,26
"i confess that such discussions with the canadian always baffled me . i did n't want to restrict my companions ' freedom in any way , and yet i had no desire to leave captain nemo . thanks to him and his submersible , i was finishing my undersea research by the day , and i was rewriting my book on the great ocean depths in the midst of its very element . would i ever again have such an opportunity to observe the ocean 's wonders ? absolutely not ! so i could n't entertain this idea of leaving the nautilus before completing our course of inquiry .",35
""" ned my friend , "" i said , "" answer me honestly . are you bored with this ship ? are you sorry that fate has cast you into captain nemo 's hands ? """,31
""" i think as master does , "" conseil replied , "" and it 's extremely possible that after crossing every sea on the globe , captain nemo will bid the three of us a fond farewell . """,27
""" sir , "" ned went on , "" let 's suppose that by some impossibility , captain nemo offered your freedom to you this very day . would you accept ? """,18
""" but one proviso , "" i said , "" just one . the opportunity must be the real thing . our first attempt to escape must succeed , because if it misfires , we wo n't get a second chance , and captain nemo will never forgive us . """,44
""" because captain nemo recognizes that we have n't given up all hope of recovering our freedom , and he 'll keep on his guard , above all in seas within sight of the coasts of europe . """,3
"that 's how we ended this conversation , which later was to have such serious consequences . at first , i must say , events seemed to confirm my forecasts , much to the canadian 's despair . did captain nemo view us with distrust in these heavily traveled seas , or did he simply want to hide from the sight of those ships of every nation that plowed the mediterranean ? i have no idea , but usually he stayed in midwater and well out from any coast . either the nautilus surfaced only enough to let its pilothouse emerge , or it slipped away to the lower depths , although , between the greek islands and asia minor , we did n't find bottom even at 2,000 meters down .",40
"accordingly , i became aware of the isle of karpathos , one of the sporades islands , only when captain nemo placed his finger over a spot on the world map and quoted me this verse from virgil :",20
"i turned to captain nemo , and in an agitated voice :",4
"to my deep astonishment , captain nemo gave him a signal . the diver answered with his hand , immediately swam up to the surface of the sea , and did n't reappear .",6
"this said , captain nemo went to a cabinet standing near the lounge 's left panel . next to this cabinet i saw a chest bound with hoops of iron , its lid bearing a copper plaque that displayed the nautilus 's monogram with its motto mobilis in mobili .",4
"i did n't pronounce a word . i gaped . captain nemo took out the ingots one by one and arranged them methodically inside the chest , filling it to the top . at which point i estimate that it held more than 1,000 kilograms of gold , in other words , close to 5,000,000 francs .",11
"after securely fastening the chest , captain nemo wrote an address on its lid in characters that must have been modern greek .",7
just then captain nemo turned to me :,3
""" then , sir , with your permission , i 'll bid you good evening . "" and with that , captain nemo left the lounge .",22
so those millions had been delivered to their address . at what spot on the continent ? who was the recipient of captain nemo 's gold ?,23
"i was about to leave the lounge when captain nemo entered . he approached the thermometer , consulted it , and turned to me :",9
""" here it is , "" captain nemo replied , showing me a chart of the greek islands . "" you observe that i 've entered the new islets in their place . """,7
""" no , it would n't be advisable , "" replied nemo the emotionless .",11
"but as beautiful as it was , i could get only a quick look at this basin whose surface area comprises 2,000,000 square kilometers . even captain nemo 's personal insights were denied me , because that mystifying individual did n't appear one single time during our high - speed crossing . i estimate that the nautilus covered a track of some 600 leagues under the waves of this sea , and this voyage was accomplished in just twenty - four hours times two . departing from the waterways of greece on the morning of february 16 , we cleared the strait of gibraltar by sunrise on the 18th .",27
"it was obvious to me that this mediterranean , pinned in the middle of those shores he wanted to avoid , gave captain nemo no pleasure . its waves and breezes brought back too many memories , if not too many regrets . here he no longer had the ease of movement and freedom of maneuver that the oceans allowed him , and his nautilus felt cramped so close to the coasts of both africa and europe .",23
