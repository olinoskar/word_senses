"first , my stranger of meung ; then de wardes , to whom i have given three sword wounds ; next milady , whose secret i have discovered ; finally , the cardinal , whose vengeance i have balked . """,3
""" unintentionally ? "" the stranger replied , raising his voice a little . "" was it unintentionally that the abraham lincoln hunted me on every sea ? was it unintentionally that you traveled aboard that frigate ? was it unintentionally that your shells bounced off my ship 's hull ? was it unintentionally that mr . ned land hit me with his harpoon ? """,5
"who this beneficent stranger is , whose intervention has , so fortunately for us , been manifested on many occasions , i can not imagine .",3
"ayrton is indebted to him as much as we are , for , if it was the stranger who saved me from the waves after the fall from the balloon , evidently it was he who wrote the document , who placed the bottle in the channel , and who has made known to us the situation of our companion .",17
""" so you understand , sir , "" the stranger went on , "" that i have a right to treat you as my enemy . """,9
"immediately two waiters and two servant - girls , dressed in cloth of gold , and their hair braided with ribbons of tissue , accosted the strangers and invited them to sit down to the ordinary . their dinner consisted of four dishes of different soups , each garnished with two young paroquets , a large dish of bouille that weighed two hundred weight , two roasted monkeys of a delicious flavor , three hundred hummingbirds in one dish , and six hundred flybirds in another ; some excellent ragouts , delicate tarts , and the whole served up in dishes of rock - crystal . several sorts of liquors , extracted from the sugarcane , were handed about by the servants who attended .",26
"the stranger looked at him again with a slight smile , and retiring from the window , came out of the hostelry with a slow step , and placed himself before the horse , within two paces of d’artagnan .",1
"he had reflected that in a few minutes the cardinal would be warned by this cursed stranger , who appeared to be his agent , and he judged , with reason , he had not a moment to lose .",16
""" this horse is decidedly , or rather has been in his youth , a buttercup , "" resumed the stranger , continuing the remarks he had begun , and addressing himself to his auditors at the window , without paying the least attention to the exasperation of d’artagnan , who , however placed himself between him and them . "" it is a color very well known in botany , but till the present time very rare among horses . """,20
""" i do not often laugh , sir , "" replied the stranger , "" as you may perceive by the expression of my countenance ; but nevertheless i retain the privilege of laughing when i please . """,12
""" indeed , sir , "" continued the stranger , more calm than ever ; "" well , that is perfectly right ! "" and turning on his heel , was about to re - enter the hostelry by the front gate , beneath which d’artagnan on arriving had observed a saddled horse .",8
"gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand . at his call they entered the room , and the stranger was lifted and carried out . as they raised him , a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor . lestrade grabbed it up and stared at it with mystified eyes .",20
""" none , sir , "" the stranger replied .",7
but the stranger knew not the headstrong personage he had to do with ; d’artagnan was not the man ever to cry for quarter .,2
"candide asked to see the high court of justice , the parliament ; but was answered that they had none in that country , being utter strangers to lawsuits . he then inquired if they had any prisons ; they replied none . but what gave him at once the greatest surprise and pleasure was the palace of sciences , where he saw a gallery two thousand feet long , filled with the various apparatus in mathematics and natural philosophy .",26
""" why , this fellow must be the devil in person ! "" cried the stranger .",15
"and you are not a pining outcast amongst strangers ? """,8
""" monsieur de treville ? "" said the stranger , becoming attentive , "" he put his hand upon his pocket while pronouncing the name of monsieur de treville ?",8
""" true : no doubt he may appear so to a stranger , but i am so accustomed to his manner , i never think of it ; and then , if he has peculiarities of temper , allowance should be made . "" "" why ? """,11
"from the bosom of his robe he then produced a casket , opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and earrings ; she acted astonishment and admiration ; kneeling , he laid the treasure at her feet ; incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks and gestures ; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the rings in her ears .",49
"he is very young ; but a sword thrust is a sword thrust , whatever be the age of him who gives it , and a youth is less to be suspected than an older man , "" and the stranger fell into a reverie which lasted some minutes .",40
""" it is possible that stapleton did not know of the existence of an heir in canada . in any case he would very soon learn it from his friend dr . mortimer , and he was told by the latter all details about the arrival of henry baskerville . stapleton 's first idea was that this young stranger from canada might possibly be done to death in london without coming down to devonshire at all . he distrusted his wife ever since she had refused to help him in laying a trap for the old man , and he dared not leave her long out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her . it was for this reason that he took her to london with him . they lodged , i find , at the mexborough private hotel , in craven street , which was actually one of those called upon by my agent in search of evidence . here he kept his wife imprisoned in her room while he , disguised in a beard , followed dr . mortimer to baker street and afterwards to the station and to the northumberland hotel . his wife had some inkling of his plans ; but she had such a fear of her husband -- a fear founded upon brutal ill - treatment -- that she dare not write to warn the man whom she knew to be in danger . if the letter should fall into stapleton 's hands her own life would not be safe . eventually , as we know , she adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would form the message , and addressing the letter in a disguised hand . it reached the baronet , and gave him the first warning of his danger .",58
"but he felt afraid of him , and ashamed of being afraid . why had it been left for a stranger to reveal him to himself ? he had known basil hallward for months , but the friendship between them had never altered him . suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to have disclosed to him life 's mystery . and , yet , what was there to be afraid of ? he was not a schoolboy or a girl . it was absurd to be frightened .",20
"he agreed with his friends on this point , that the stranger must be either english or american , the name britannia leading them to suppose this , and , besides , through the bushy beard , and under the shaggy , matted hair , the engineer thought he could recognize the characteristic features of the anglo - saxon .",11
""" ho , ho ! "" said the cunning vanderdendur to himself , "" this stranger must be very rich ; he agrees to give me ten thousand piastres without hesitation . """,15
but an imperious glance from the stranger stopped him short ; he bowed humbly and retired .,6
"and the stranger , muttering to himself , directed his steps toward the kitchen .",2
giving him to understand that the police would deal with him pretty severely for having sought a quarrel with a great lord -- for the opinion of the host the stranger could be nothing less than a great lord -- he insisted that notwithstanding his weakness d’artagnan should get up and depart as quickly as possible .,30
she was talking with great animation with the stranger .,8
"the post - chaise stopped ; the driver rang the door - bell , and a gentleman alighted attired in travelling garb ; but it was not mr . rochester ; it was a tall , fashionable - looking man , a stranger .",42
"the stranger was about to reply ; but at the moment he opened his mouth , d’artagnan , who had heard all , precipitated himself over the threshold of the door .",1
""" will not escape him ? "" replied the stranger , knitting his brow .",9
""" remember , "" said milady , seeing the stranger lay his hand on his sword , "" the least delay may ruin everything . """,9
""" pay him , booby ! "" cried the stranger to his servant , without checking the speed of his horse ; and the man , after throwing two or three silver pieces at the foot of mine host , galloped after his master .",9
"the stranger advanced slowly , and as he advanced , after entering into the circle of light projected by the lamp , milady involuntarily drew back .",1
"yet a chance traveller might pass by ; and i wish no eye to see me now : strangers would wonder what i am doing , lingering here at the sign - post , evidently objectless and lost .",18
"already , forgetting his carnivorous instincts , the stranger accepted a less bestial nourishment than that on which he fed on the islet , and cooked meat did not produce in him the same sentiment of repulsion which he had showed on board the "" bonadventure . """,8
"why i was here only ten or twelve days ago . i was conducting some friends , musketeers , one of whom , by the by , had a dispute with a stranger -- a man who sought a quarrel with him , for i do n’t know what . """,32
"the result was that , thanks to these attentions , the stranger resumed a more human appearance , and it even seemed as if his eyes had become milder .",11
"but perhaps it had been only his fancy that had called vengeance out of the night and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him . actual life was chaos , but there was something terribly logical in the imagination . it was the imagination that set remorse to dog the feet of sin . it was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen brood . in the common world of fact the wicked were not punished , nor the good rewarded . success was given to the strong , failure thrust upon the weak . that was all . besides , had any stranger been prowling round the house , he would have been seen by the servants or the keepers . had any foot - marks been found on the flower - beds , the gardeners would have reported it . yes , it had been merely fancy . sibyl vane 's brother had not come back to kill him . he had sailed away in his ship to founder in some winter sea . from him , at any rate , he was safe . why , the man did not know who he was , could not know who he was . the mask of youth had saved him .",106
""" i swear to you , monsieur commissary , that you are in the profoundest error , that i know nothing in the world about what my wife had to do , that i am entirely a stranger to what she has done ; and that if she has committed any follies , i renounce her , i abjure her , i curse her ! """,37
"at times , the stranger gave some slight attention to what was said , and the settlers were soon convinced that he partly understood them .",4
""" look at sir charles 's death ! that was bad enough , for all that the coroner said . look at the noises on the moor at night . there 's not a man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for it . look at this stranger hiding out yonder , and watching and waiting ! what 's he waiting for ? what does it mean ? it means no good to anyone of the name of baskerville , and very glad i shall be to be quit of it all on the day that sir henry 's new servants are ready to take over the hall . """,50
""" but about this stranger , "" said i. "" can you tell me anything about him ? what did selden say ? did he find out where he hid , or what he was doing ? """,4
"when i reached coombe tracey i told perkins to put up the horses , and i made inquiries for the lady whom i had come to interrogate . i had no difficulty in finding her rooms , which were central and well appointed . a maid showed me in without ceremony , and as i entered the sitting - room a lady , who was sitting before a remington typewriter , sprang up with a pleasant smile of welcome . her face fell , however , when she saw that i was a stranger , and she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit .",93
"arrived at the spot on which grew the first beautiful trees of the forest , their foliage slightly agitated by the breeze , the stranger appeared greedily to drink in the penetrating odor which filled the atmosphere , and a long sigh escaped from his chest .",24
"the consul did not finish his sentence , for as he spoke a knock was heard at the door , and two strangers entered , one of whom was the servant whom fix had met on the quay . the other , who was his master , held out his passport with the request that the consul would do him the favour to visa it . the consul took the document and carefully read it , whilst fix observed , or rather devoured , the stranger with his eyes from a corner of the room .",85
""" papa says you never come to see us now , "" continued miss oliver , looking up . "" you are quite a stranger at vale hall .",24
"the trees on the right bank were as close together as on the left bank , and it was impossible to distinguish anything beyond them ; but these masses of wood were evidently uninhabited , for top did not bark , and the intelligent animal would not have failed to signal the presence of any stranger in the neighborhood .",55
"two days after this occurrence , the stranger appeared to wish gradually to mingle with their common life .",7
"the stranger had begun to use the laboring tools , and he worked in the garden .",1
""" i am a stranger , without acquaintance in this place . i want some work : no matter what . """,4
"the stranger tried to avoid his look , and cyrus harding having endeavored to take his hand , he drew back quickly .",1
"the stranger looked at the engineer , and seemed to be under his power , as a subject under the influence of a mesmerist .",1
"it is possible after all that the stranger , if we manage to find him , may know as much about tabor island as about lincoln island .",7
""" look ye , young man , "" said the marchioness , "" you are a stranger ; i make some of my lovers here in paris languish for me a whole fortnight ; but i surrender to you at first sight , because i am willing to do the honors of my country to a young westphalian . """,16
"the fair one having cast her eye on two very large diamonds that were upon the young stranger 's finger , praised them in so earnest a manner that they were in an instant transferred from his finger to hers .",17
""" you are quite a stranger to me -- where is bessie ? """,5
"for two hours the stranger remained alone on the shore , evidently under the influence of recollections which recalled all his past life -- a melancholy life doubtless -- and the colonists , without losing sight of him , did not attempt to disturb his solitude .",4
""" ah ! "" said the stranger , and he murmured , "" i prefer that ! """,6
"the stranger placed the point of his sword at his throat ; and monsieur porthos , finding himself at the mercy of his adversary , acknowledged himself conquered .",1
"upon which the stranger asked his name , and learning that it was porthos , and not d’artagnan , he assisted him to rise , brought him back to the hotel , mounted his horse , and disappeared . """,3
"although he was a perfect stranger in the court of m. de treville ’s courtiers , and this his first appearance in that place , he was at length noticed , and somebody came and asked him what he wanted .",5
"but at the moment mousqueton came to announce that the horses were ready , and they were arising from table , the stranger proposed to porthos to drink the health of the cardinal .",22
the stranger cried that he acknowledged no other king but his eminence .,1
"porthos called him drunk , and the stranger drew his sword .",7
"i could not believe my own eyes ; but the heated air and the sensation of burning left me no room for doubt . we had come out of the crater half naked , and the radiant orb to which we had been strangers for two months was lavishing upon us out of his blazing splendours more of his light and heat than we were able to receive with comfort .",43
"when my eyes had become accustomed to the bright light to which they had been so long strangers , i began to use them to set my imagination right . at least i would have it to be spitzbergen , and i was in no humour to give up this notion .",17
""" ah , monsieur porthos , "" cried the procurator ’s wife , when she was assured that no one who was a stranger to the population of the locality could either see or hear her , "" ah , monsieur porthos , you are a great conqueror , as it appears ! """,23
"so i turned at the door : i saw a robed and veiled figure , so unlike my usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger .",28
"and then at last i heard him . far away came the sharp clink of a boot striking upon a stone . then another and yet another , coming nearer and nearer . i shrank back into the darkest corner , and cocked the pistol in my pocket , determined not to discover myself until i had an opportunity of seeing something of the stranger . there was a long pause which showed that he had stopped . then once more the footsteps approached and a shadow fell across the opening of the hut .",64
""" there is no dishonour , no breach of promise , no desertion in the case . i am not under the slightest obligation to go to india , especially with strangers .",31
""" i am a stranger . """,4
"my conjecture had been correct : the strangers had slipped in before us , and they now stood by the vault of the rochesters , their backs towards us , viewing through the rails the old time - stained marble tomb , where a kneeling angel guarded the remains of damer de rochester , slain at marston moor in the time of the civil wars , and of elizabeth , his wife .",7
""" i have heard great talk , "" said candide , "" of the senator pococurante , who lives in that fine house at the brenta , where , they say , he entertains foreigners in the most polite manner . "" "" they pretend this man is a perfect stranger to uneasiness .",50
"it is useless to describe the astonishing performances of the acrobats and gymnasts . the turning on ladders , poles , balls , barrels , & c. , was executed with wonderful precision . but the principal attraction was the exhibition of the long noses , a show to which europe is as yet a stranger .",55
"d’artagnan had run , sword in hand , through all the neighboring streets , but had found nobody resembling the man he sought for . then he came back to the point where , perhaps , he ought to have begun , and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had leaned ; but this proved useless -- for though he knocked ten or twelve times in succession , no one answered , and some of the neighbors , who put their noses out of their windows or were brought to their doors by the noise , had assured him that that house , all the openings of which were tightly closed , had not been inhabited for six months .",53
"but , alas ! for me to do wrong that never did right , was no great wonder . i hail no remedy but to go on : i had got into an employment quite remote to my genius , and directly contrary to the life i delighted in , and for which i forsook my father ’s house , and broke through all his good advice . nay , i was coming into the very middle station , or upper degree of low life , which my father advised me to before , and which , if i resolved to go on with , i might as well have stayed at home , and never have fatigued myself in the world as i had done ; and i used often to say to myself , i could have done this as well in england , among my friends , as have gone five thousand miles off to do it among strangers and savages , in a wilderness , and at such a distance as never to hear from any part of the world that had the least knowledge of me .",161
"but herbert , from the height of his observatory , could examine all the yet unknown portion of the island , which might have given shelter to the strangers whose presence they suspected .",28
the stranger possessed immense strength and activity .,1
"the stranger kicked away the body , and was about to fly at the moment when the settlers arrived on the field of battle , but herbert , clinging to him , cried,--",1
"then a fourth domestic said to the fourth stranger , "" your majesty may set off when you please "" ; saying which , he went away like the rest .",8
""" my life ! "" murmured the stranger .",7
"then , casting a glance on the handsome young man , who was scarcely twenty - five years of age , and whom he was leaving in his gore , deprived of sense and perhaps dead , he gave a sigh for that unaccountable destiny which leads men to destroy each other for the interests of people who are strangers to them and who often do not even know that they exist .",59
"at these words the stranger 's face flushed , his head sunk on his breast , and confusion was depicted on his countenance .",4
"mr . rochester held the candle over him ; i recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face -- the stranger , mason : i saw too that his linen on one side , and one arm , was almost soaked in blood .",20
would the stranger one day speak of it ?,2
"and this man i bent over -- this commonplace , quiet stranger -- how had he become involved in the web of horror ? and why had the fury flown at him ?",11
"the explorers proceeded towards the south , disturbing numerous flocks of sea - birds and herds of seals , which threw themselves into the sea as soon as they saw the strangers at a distance .",31
"at these words the stranger reddened , and was on the point of withdrawing .",4
""" yes , "" replied the stranger .",6
"d’artagnan , stranger as he was to all the manners of a court , could not but perceive a little coldness in this reception .",2
"must not this stranger have indeed mingled with their existence , have known the smallest details , have heard all that was said in granite house , to have been able always to act in the very nick of time ?",3
"at the same time , and with the rapidity of lightning , the stranger drew his .",13
""" thank you , sir , "" replied the stranger as he withdrew .",9
"probably the house was occupied by the stranger , since it was from thence that the telegram had been sent .",7
"jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive glance of some stranger . he had that dislike of being stared at , which comes on geniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace . sibyl , however , was quite unconscious of the effect she was producing . her love was trembling in laughter on her lips . she was thinking of prince charming , and , that she might think of him all the more , she did not talk of him , but prattled on about the ship in which jim was going to sail , about the gold he was certain to find , about the wonderful heiress whose life he was to save from the wicked , red - shirted bushrangers . for he was not to remain a sailor , or a supercargo , or whatever he was going to be . oh , no ! a sailor 's existence was dreadful . fancy being cooped up in a horrid ship , with the hoarse , hump - backed waves trying to get in , and a black wind blowing the masts down and tearing the sails into long screaming ribands !",14
"i know that a stranger 's hand will write to me next , to say that the good and faithful servant has been called at length into the joy of his lord .",4
"wearing caps made of sea - otter fur , and shod in sealskin fishing boots , these two strangers were dressed in clothing made from some unique fabric that flattered the figure and allowed great freedom of movement .",18
""" did you ? "" not in my time , i thought : you are a stranger to me .",16
"this last attempt ultimately misfiring , the two strangers exchanged a few words in their incomprehensible language and withdrew , not even favoring us with one of those encouraging gestures that are used in every country in the world . the door closed again .",8
"i suppose you are a stranger in these parts , or you would have heard what happened last autumn,--thornfield hall is quite a ruin : it was burnt down just about harvest - time .",5
"the engineer had supposed that the wire would perhaps stop at the bottom of the valley , and that the stranger 's retreat would be there .",20
"candide and cacambo were immediately disarmed , and their two andalusian horses were seized . the two strangers were conducted between two files of musketeers , the commandant was at the further end with a three - cornered cap on his head , his gown tucked up , a sword by his side , and a half - pike in his hand ; he made a sign , and instantly four and twenty soldiers drew up round the newcomers .",17
"in sybil 's own room they parted . there was jealousy in the lad 's heart , and a fierce murderous hatred of the stranger who , as it seemed to him , had come between them . yet , when her arms were flung round his neck , and her fingers strayed through his hair , he softened and kissed her with real affection . there were tears in his eyes as he went downstairs .",24

"and i do not want a stranger -- unsympathising , alien , different from me ; i want my kindred : those with whom i have full fellow- feeling .",6
"and he set off running as if the devil possessed him , hoping that he might yet find the stranger , whose slow pace could not have carried him far .",19
