"creasing his brow , lowering his lids , and puckering the corners of his eyes , the canadian focused the full power of his gaze on the ship for a short while .",17
"i straightened suddenly . i admit that i was less than ready for this announcement . i wanted to reply to the canadian , but words failed me .",22
""" admitted , "" the canadian replied , "" but we 've got to risk it . freedom is worth paying for . besides , the longboat 's solidly built , and a few miles with the wind behind us is no big deal . by tomorrow , who knows if this ship wo n't be 100 leagues out to sea ? if circumstances are in our favor , between ten and eleven this evening we 'll be landing on some piece of solid ground , or we 'll be dead . so we 're in god 's hands , and i 'll see you this evening ! """,5
"this issue settled , i went to find ned land . i wanted to take him with me . the obstinate canadian refused , and i could clearly see that his tight - lipped mood and his bad temper were growing by the day . under the circumstances i ultimately was n't sorry that he refused . in truth , there were too many seals ashore , and it would never do to expose this impulsive fisherman to such temptations .",21
""" nothing , sir , "" the canadian replied . "" he said you 'd already discussed this little stroll . """,7
""" what 's more , "" the canadian added , "" if they catch me , i 'll defend myself , i 'll fight to the death . """,7
""" me ? "" the canadian replied . "" i 'm a professional harpooner ! it 's my job to make a mockery of them ! """,5
""" ye gods , "" the canadian shot back , "" i 'm starting to appreciate the charms of cannibalism ! """,6
"to say canadian is to say french , and as unsociable as ned land was , i must admit he took a definite liking to me . no doubt it was my nationality that attracted him . it was an opportunity for him to speak , and for me to hear , that old rabelaisian dialect still used in some canadian provinces . the harpooner 's family originated in quebec , and they were already a line of bold fishermen back in the days when this town still belonged to france .",2

""" wooden ships maybe , "" the canadian replied . "" but i 've never seen the like . so till i have proof to the contrary , i 'll deny that baleen whales , sperm whales , or unicorns can do any such thing . """,7
""" and how will you prepare it ? "" i asked the canadian .",12
""" not quite , professor , "" the canadian replied . "" we need some fruit to go with it , or at least some vegetables . """,8
""" note well , my fine canadian , "" i went on , "" if such an animal exists , if it lives deep in the ocean , if it frequents the liquid strata located miles beneath the surface of the water , it needs to have a constitution so solid , it defies all comparison . """,6
""" excellent , ned , "" i said , extending my hand to the canadian .",14
"ned land still kept up the most tenacious skepticism ; beyond his spells on watch , he pretended that he never even looked at the surface of the waves , at least while no whales were in sight . and yet the marvelous power of his vision could have performed yeoman service . but this stubborn canadian spent eight hours out of every twelve reading or sleeping in his cabin . a hundred times i chided him for his unconcern .",56
""" all right , ned , "" i asked the canadian , "" now what do you need ? """,10
""" but do n't you realize , professor aronnax , "" the canadian replied , "" that soon we 'll have been imprisoned for three whole months aboard this nautilus ? """,12
"so the skiff did n't leave shipside that day , much to the displeasure of mr . land who could n't complete his provisions . the adroit canadian spent his time preparing the meat and flour products he had brought from gueboroa island . as for the savages , they went back to shore near eleven o'clock in the morning , when the heads of coral began to disappear under the waves of the rising tide . but i saw their numbers swell considerably on the beach . it was likely that they had come from neighboring islands or from the mainland of papua proper . however , i did n't see one local dugout canoe .",27
""" but where are the fish ? "" the canadian ventured to observe . "" i do n't see any fish ! """,9
""" to put a simple question to you , sir , "" the canadian answered me .",13
""" all right , "" the canadian said , "" then why should there be any more than that ? """,6
""" no problem , "" the canadian went on insistently .",6
"on this note i was about to withdraw ; but captain nemo detained me and invited me to take a seat next to him . he questioned me with interest on our excursions ashore and on our hunting , but seemed not to understand the canadian 's passionate craving for red meat . then our conversation skimmed various subjects , and without being more forthcoming , captain nemo proved more affable .",45
""" you saw that ? "" the canadian asked .",7
"the next day , november 9 , i woke up only after a long , twelve - hour slumber . conseil , a creature of habit , came to ask "" how master 's night went , "" and to offer his services . he had left his canadian friend sleeping like a man who had never done anything else .",48
""" does anybody fish for 'em nowadays ? "" the canadian asked .",10
this maneuver did not escape the canadian .,6
"the canadian might have quoted a much lower price . so it was imperative to make contact with whatever beings were confined inside the plating of this machine . i searched its surface for an opening or a hatch , a "" manhole , "" to use the official term ; but the lines of rivets had been firmly driven into the sheet - iron joins and were straight and uniform .",1
""" tell it to the marines , sir , "" answered the stubborn canadian .",13
""" what i 've got to tell you is very simple , "" the canadian replied . "" we 're in europe , and before captain nemo 's whims take us deep into the polar seas or back to oceania , i say we should leave this nautilus . """,14
""" professor aronnax , "" the canadian replied , "" your arguments are rotten to the core . you talk way off in the future : ' we 'll be here , we 'll be there ! ' me , i 'm talking about right now : we are here , and we must take advantage of it ! """,6
"captain nemo inserted his cranium into its spherical headgear . conseil and i did the same , but not without hearing the canadian toss us a sarcastic "" happy hunting . "" on top , the suit ended in a collar of threaded copper onto which the metal helmet was screwed . three holes , protected by heavy glass , allowed us to see in any direction with simply a turn of the head inside the sphere . placed on our backs , the rouquayrol device went into operation as soon as it was in position , and for my part , i could breathe with ease .",22
""" when ? "" the canadian asked insistently .",5
""" well , professor , "" the canadian replied , "" you can just drop that idea ! you 've made it to the ice bank , which is already far enough , but you wo n't get any farther , neither your captain nemo or his nautilus . and whether he wants to or not , we 'll head north again , in other words , to the land of sensible people . """,7
""" there you go again , conseil my friend ! "" the impatient canadian shot back . "" you never allow yourself any displays of bile or attacks of nerves ! you 're everlastingly calm ! you 'd say your after - meal grace even if you did n't get any food for your before - meal blessing-- and you 'd starve to death rather than complain ! """,13
""" i have your word , ned , "" i answered the canadian .",12
i left him and climbed onto the platform . conseil and the canadian were already there .,12
""" every animal may be overstating it , but in truth i doubt we could keep our canadian friend from harpooning some of these magnificent cetaceans . which would be an affront to captain nemo , since he hates to slay harmless beasts needlessly . """,17
