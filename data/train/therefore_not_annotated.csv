"the settlers , therefore , went to the plateau , ascending the left bank of the mercy , and placed themselves on the edge which looked northwest and southeast , that is , above the curiously - shaped rocks which bordered the river .",3
"i was therefore meditating a proper introduction to the matter , so as not to seem too abrupt , when the professor jumped up , clapped on his hat , and prepared to go out .",2

"but this time , instead of snæfell , an extinct volcano , we were inside one in full activity . i wondered , therefore , where could this mountain be , and in what part of the world we were to be shot out .",23
"they therefore waited with some impatience , when an incident occurred which increased the desire the settlers had to visit the whole of their domain .",1
"it might even have been said that he did not observe the country at all , either in its configuration or in its natural productions , his great aim being to climb the mountain before him , and therefore straight towards it he went .",38
"we have no need , therefore , to say that d’artagnan dared not join in the conversation , only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his ears , stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing ; and despite his confidence on the paternal admonitions , he felt himself carried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to blame the unheard - of things which were taking place .",5
"the carpenters , therefore , worked vigorously during the month of april , which was troubled only by a few equinoctial gales of some violence .",3
"cyrus harding concluded , therefore , that lincoln island was situated on the thirty - seventh degree of the southern latitude , or taking into consideration through the imperfection of the performance , an error of five degrees , that it must be situated between the thirty - fifth and the fortieth parallel .",4
"therefore , he awaited the next day with the greatest anxiety .",0
"when , therefore , a voice broke the strange stillness at last , it was audible enough to me .",2
"i agree , therefore , with mr . spilett , that she must be left in port balloon .",3
"the colonists , therefore , were careful to observe the sea around the island , and every day their telescope covered the horizon enclosed by union and washington bays .",3
"therefore mousqueton alone fell from his horse , not because he was severely wounded , but not being able to see the wound , he judged it to be more serious than it really was .",0
"the colonists waited , therefore , for ayrton to appear on prospect heights .",4
""" then , i will presume to say that all my friends are in the king ’s musketeers and guards , and that by an inconceivable fatality my enemies are in the service of your eminence ; i should , therefore , be ill received here and ill regarded there if i accepted what monseigneur offers me . """,40

to such positive statements i could make no reply . i therefore took refuge in other dark passages of the document .,11
"decidedly , my uncle had answered every one of my objections . i saw that his position on the old parchment was impregnable . i therefore ceased to press him upon that part of the subject , and as above all things he must be convinced , i passed on to scientific objections , which in my opinion were far more serious .",25

""" because this liquid mass would be subject , like the ocean , to the lunar attraction , and therefore twice every day there would be internal tides , which , upheaving the terrestrial crust , would cause periodical earthquakes ! """,19

"thus ended this memorable seance . that conversation threw me into a fever . i came out of my uncle 's study as if i had been stunned , and as if there was not air enough in all the streets of hamburg to put me right again . i therefore made for the banks of the elbe , where the steamer lands her passengers , which forms the communication between the city and the hamburg railway .",50
"i shall therefore reproduce here these daily notes , written , so to speak , as the course of events directed , in order to furnish an exact narrative of our passage .",2
"therefore athos had invented the phrase , family affair .",0
"in consequence , therefore , a few days after , on the 25th of april , in the evening , when the settlers were all collected on prospect heights , cyrus harding began by saying,--",3
"cyrus harding , therefore , resolved to proceed without any further delay to the fabrication of a strong rope ladder , which , once raised , would render granite house completely inaccessible .",3
"passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie . up to his arrival at bombay , he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there ; but , now that they were plainly whirling across india at full speed , a sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams . his old vagabond nature returned to him ; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took possession of him . he came to regard his master 's project as intended in good earnest , believed in the reality of the bet , and therefore in the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail within the designated period . already he began to worry about possible delays , and accidents which might happen on the way . he recognised himself as being personally interested in the wager , and trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable folly of the night before . being much less cool - headed than mr . fogg , he was much more restless , counting and recounting the days passed over , uttering maledictions when the train stopped , and accusing it of sluggishness , and mentally blaming mr . fogg for not having bribed the engineer . the worthy fellow was ignorant that , while it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer , it could not be done on the railway .",96
"the train entered the defiles of the sutpour mountains , which separate the khandeish from bundelcund , towards evening . the next day sir francis cromarty asked passepartout what time it was ; to which , on consulting his watch , he replied that it was three in the morning . this famous timepiece , always regulated on the greenwich meridian , which was now some seventy - seven degrees westward , was at least four hours slow . sir francis corrected passepartout 's time , whereupon the latter made the same remark that he had done to fix ; and upon the general insisting that the watch should be regulated in each new meridian , since he was constantly going eastward , that is in the face of the sun , and therefore the days were shorter by four minutes for each degree gone over , passepartout obstinately refused to alter his watch , which he kept at london time . it was an innocent delusion which could harm no one .",133
"the steamer which was about to depart from yokohama to san francisco belonged to the pacific mail steamship company , and was named the general grant . she was a large paddle - wheel steamer of two thousand five hundred tons ; well equipped and very fast . the massive walking - beam rose and fell above the deck ; at one end a piston - rod worked up and down ; and at the other was a connecting - rod which , in changing the rectilinear motion to a circular one , was directly connected with the shaft of the paddles . the general grant was rigged with three masts , giving a large capacity for sails , and thus materially aiding the steam power . by making twelve miles an hour , she would cross the ocean in twenty - one days . phileas fogg was therefore justified in hoping that he would reach san francisco by the 2nd of december , new york by the 11th , and london on the 20th -- thus gaining several hours on the fatal date of the 21st of december .",148
"in journeying eastward he had gone towards the sun , and the days therefore diminished for him as many times four minutes as he crossed degrees in this direction . there are three hundred and sixty degrees on the circumference of the earth ; and these three hundred and sixty degrees , multiplied by four minutes , gives precisely twenty - four hours -- that is , the day unconsciously gained . in other words , while phileas fogg , going eastward , saw the sun pass the meridian eighty times , his friends in london only saw it pass the meridian seventy - nine times . this is why they awaited him at the reform club on saturday , and not sunday , as mr . fogg thought .",13
"one day in the island , three or four to return , they might hope therefore that on the 17th they would again reach lincoln island .",15
"although , therefore , the spreading of the volcanic matter might not constitute a serious danger , any movement of the terrestrial structure which should shake the island might entail the gravest consequences .",2
"it was therefore agreed that the next morning at break of day , they should set out , by ascending the mercy so as to reach the western shore .",2
"she knew she had only two days left ; that when once the order was signed by buckingham -- and buckingham would sign it the more readily from its bearing a false name , and he could not , therefore , recognize the woman in question -- once this order was signed , we say , the baron would make her embark immediately , and she knew very well that women condemned to exile employ arms much less powerful in their seductions than the pretendedly virtuous woman whose beauty is lighted by the sun of the world , whose style the voice of fashion lauds , and whom a halo of aristocracy gilds with enchanting splendors .",39
"at these words , which left no hope , milady raised herself in all her pride , and wished to speak ; but her strength failed her . she felt that a powerful and implacable hand seized her by the hair , and dragged her away as irrevocably as fatality drags humanity . she did not , therefore , even attempt the least resistance , and went out of the cottage .",57
"therefore there is not an hour to lose ! """,0
"nothing therefore which threw any light on the supposed wreck could be found on this shore , yet an object of any importance , such as the hull of a ship , would have been seen directly , or any of her masts and spars would have been washed on shore , just as the chest had been , which was found twenty miles from here .",1
"she had the less motive to resist , resistance would make so much noise . therefore kitty surrendered .",15
"d’artagnan remained , therefore , alone ; and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play it regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without counting .",3
"i was positively against that ; and looking over the charts of the sea - coast of america with him , we concluded there was no inhabited country for us to have recourse to till we came within the circle of the caribbee islands , and therefore resolved to stand away for barbadoes ; which , by keeping off at sea , to avoid the indraft of the bay or gulf of mexico , we might easily perform , as we hoped , in about fifteen days ’ sail ; whereas we could not possibly make our voyage to the coast of africa without some assistance both to our ship and to ourselves .",46
"it became necessary , therefore , to destroy this last bulwark of calvinism -- a dangerous leaven with which the ferments of civil revolt and foreign war were constantly mingling .",4

"it was decided , therefore , that they would winter at lincoln island , and that they would look for a more comfortable dwelling than the chimneys , in which to pass the winter months .",4
"mr . fogg , on reaching shore , proceeded to find out at what hour the first train left for new york , and learned that this was at six o'clock p.m. ; he had , therefore , an entire day to spend in the californian capital . taking a carriage at a charge of three dollars , he and aouda entered it , while passepartout mounted the box beside the driver , and they set out for the international hotel .",36
"it was , therefore the first , the oxide of iron , which they must reduce with coal , that is to say , get rid of the oxygen , to obtain it in a pure state .",3

"it was , therefore , decided that the expedition should be carried through the far west , so as to include all that region situated on the right of the mercy .",3
"therefore , after some discussion , the first plan was adhered to , and the settlers resolved to proceed through the wood to reptile end .",0
the preparations for the winter season were therefore commenced without delay .,7
the hunters could therefore traverse it without getting wet higher than the knee .,3
"we are tired , cold , and hungry ; therefore we must have shelter , fire , and food .",9
it was therefore resolved that the little band of settlers should remain together and not separate under any pretext whatever .,2
d’artagnan therefore returned to the rue ferou .,1
"the settlers , therefore , prudently advanced towards the north point , walking over ground riddled with little holes , which formed nests for the sea - birds .",3
"they must , therefore , be satisfied with visiting each hole , and rummaging in it with a stick , hoping by dint of patience to do what could not be done in any other way .",3
"the cetacean had rammed our frigate at about eleven o'clock in the evening . i therefore calculated on eight hours of swimming until sunrise . a strenuous task , but feasible , thanks to our relieving each other . the sea was pretty smooth and barely tired us . sometimes i tried to peer through the dense gloom , which was broken only by the phosphorescent flickers coming from our movements . i stared at the luminous ripples breaking over my hands , shimmering sheets spattered with blotches of bluish gray . it seemed as if we 'd plunged into a pool of quicksilver .",15
"the reporter , therefore , thought it best to simply bathe the two wounds with cold water .",3
"i would scorn such a union : therefore i am better than you -- let me go ! """,7
pencroft 's joy was therefore shared by all .,4
"it appeared , therefore , as if the series of supernatural incidents was interrupted , although they often talked of them during the evenings in granite house , and they remained thoroughly resolved that the island should be searched , even in those parts the most difficult to explore .",3
therefore none of the colonists were at the corral .,0
"he therefore went down the rue des petits augustins , and came up to the quay , in order to take the new bridge .",1
"he repaired , therefore , immediately to his hotel , and caused himself to be announced .",3
"if the engineer had had only to deal with wild beasts , jaguars or others , he would have simply lighted fires all around his camp , which would have sufficed for its defense ; but the convicts would be rather attracted than terrified by the flames , and it was , therefore , better to be surrounded by the profound darkness of night .",52
"the lad even found the stones which he had used , and therefore he was certain of not being mistaken .",12
milady had spoken to the man in the black cloak ; therefore she knew him .,11
"during the whole of the month of june the time was employed in different occupations , which excluded neither hunting nor fishing , the larder being , therefore , abundantly supplied .",27
"the project was a bold one , full of difficulty , perhaps impracticable . mr . fogg was going to risk life , or at least liberty , and therefore the success of his tour . but he did not hesitate , and he found in sir francis cromarty an enthusiastic ally .",29
""" i telled mary how it would be , "" he said : "" i knew what mr . edward "" ( john was an old servant , and had known his master when he was the cadet of the house , therefore , he often gave him his christian name)--""i knew what mr . edward would do ; and i was certain he would not wait long neither : and he 's done right , for aught i know . i wish you joy , miss !

"they fear them , therefore they must know them . """,4
"do you , therefore , ayrton , occupy yourself with the necessary work at the corral .",3
they must therefore make up their minds to pass this first winter without additional clothing .,2
"the return to la rochelle , therefore , was profoundly dull .",6
"it may easily be understood , therefore , that the conversation during the whole of dinner turned upon the two checks that his eminence ’s guardsmen had received .",6
"imprudently , therefore , we pursue our way . the nearer we approach , the higher mounts the jet of water . what monster can possibly fill itself with such a quantity of water , and spurt it up so continuously ?",2
"and if nothing happens without his knowledge , he knows that i am here , and am in this dreadful condition ; and if nothing happens without his appointment , he has appointed all this to befall me . nothing occurred to my thought to contradict any of these conclusions , and therefore it rested upon me with the greater force , that it must needs be that god had appointed all this to befall me ; that i was brought into this miserable circumstance by his direction , he having the sole power , not of me only , but of everything that happened in the world . immediately it followed : why has god done this to me ? what have i done to be thus used ? my conscience presently checked me in that inquiry , as if i had blasphemed , and methought it spoke to me like a voice : “ wretch ! dost _ thou _ ask what thou hast done ? look back upon a dreadful misspent life , and ask thyself what thou hast _ not _ done ? ask , why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed ? why wert thou not drowned in yarmouth roads ; killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the sallee man - of - war ; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of africa ; or drowned _ here _ , when all the crew perished but thyself ? dost _ thou _ ask , what have i done ? ” i was struck dumb with these reflections , as one astonished , and had not a word to say — no , not to answer to myself , but rose up pensive and sad , walked back to my retreat , and went up over my wall , as if i had been going to bed ; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed , and i had no inclination to sleep ; so i sat down in my chair , and lighted my lamp , for it began to be dark . now , as the apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me very much , it occurred to my thought that the brazilians take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers , and i had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests , which was quite cured , and some also that was green , and not quite cured .",52
"the assassins comprehended that if they fled toward the camp without having killed their man , they should be accused by him ; therefore their first idea was to join the enemy .",23
"these amateur smiths had , of course , no hammer ; but they were in no worse a situation than the first metallurgist , and therefore did what , no doubt , he had to do .",25
"the wood , being very dry , would burn rapidly ; it was therefore necessary to carry to the chimneys a considerable quantity , and the loads of two men would not be sufficient .",13
his eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon the door through which the king must enter .,2
"the three musketeers therefore did not hesitate to make a step forward . d’artagnan on the contrary remained concealed behind them ; but although the king knew athos , porthos , and aramis personally , he passed before them without speaking or looking -- indeed , as if he had never seen them before .",3
"we walked upon granite mingled with siliceous tufa . the soil shivers and shakes under our feet , like the sides of an overheated boiler filled with steam struggling to get loose . we come in sight of a small central basin , out of which the geyser springs . i plunge a register thermometer into the boiling water . it marks an intense heat of 325 ° , which is far above the boiling point ; therefore this water issues from an ardent furnace , which is not at all in harmony with professor liedenbrock 's theories . i can not help making the remark .",77
"d’artagnan was on the point of telling athos all ; but one consideration restrained him . athos was a gentleman , punctilious in points of honor ; and there were in the plan which our lover had devised for milady , he was sure , certain things that would not obtain the assent of this puritan . he was therefore silent ; and as athos was the least inquisitive of any man on earth , d’artagnan ’s confidence stopped there .",59
"it was therefore probable that the cetacean would not be able to extricate itself easily ; at any rate it was best to hasten , so as to cut off its retreat if necessary .",2
"we will therefore leave the two friends , who had nothing important to say to each other , and follow aramis .",2
"he therefore was unable to converse with the captain about snæfell , the way to get to it , the facilities for transport , he was obliged to put off these inquiries until his arrival , and spent all his time at full length in his cabin , of which the timbers creaked and shook with every pitch she took . it must be confessed he was not undeserving of his punishment .",1
the question of a more comfortable dwelling than the chimneys must therefore be seriously considered and promptly resolved on .,11
it was therefore past ten o'clock when the engineer and his companion reached the crest of the enormous mass of rocks of basalt and porphyry which composed the northwest coast of the island .,2
"they breakfasted , therefore , near the chimneys , and during their repast , as may be supposed , nothing was talked of but the event which had so miraculously saved the colony .",3
"for five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he had already traversed on horseback . at night he flung himself down among the rocks , and snatched a few hours of sleep ; but before daybreak he was always well on his way . on the sixth day , he reached the eagle cañon , from which they had commenced their ill - fated flight . thence he could look down upon the home of the saints . worn and exhausted , he leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him . as he looked at it , he observed that there were flags in some of the principal streets , and other signs of festivity . he was still speculating as to what this might mean when he heard the clatter of horse 's hoofs , and saw a mounted man riding towards him . as he approached , he recognized him as a mormon named cowper , to whom he had rendered services at different times . he therefore accosted him when he got up to him , with the object of finding out what lucy ferrier 's fate had been .",183

"according to his journal , he was due at calcutta on the 25th of october , and that was the exact date of his actual arrival . he was therefore neither behind - hand nor ahead of time . the two days gained between london and bombay had been lost , as has been seen , in the journey across india . but it is not to be supposed that phileas fogg regretted them .",29
the brave dog therefore remained at the foot of the cliff while his master with his companions sought a refuge among the rocks .,3
"it was agreed , therefore , that they should search for his remains , and give them at least christian burial .",4
"the pope , therefore blesses with the fingers .",3
"the colonists remained , therefore , near the cart , and carefully watched the neighboring parts of the forest .",4
"while my jealousy of him lasted , you may be sure i was every day pumping him to see if he would discover any of the new thoughts which i suspected were in him ; but i found everything he said was so honest and so innocent , that i could find nothing to nourish my suspicion ; and in spite of all my uneasiness , he made me at last entirely his own again ; nor did he in the least perceive that i was uneasy , and therefore i could not suspect him of deceit .",89
"upon the whole , as i found by all his discourse a settled affection to me , and that nothing could part him from me , so i found all the foundation of his desire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent affection to the people , and his hopes of my doing them good ; a thing which , as i had no notion of myself , so i had not the least thought or intention , or desire of undertaking it . but still i found a strong inclination to attempting my escape , founded on the supposition gathered from the discourse , that there were seventeen bearded men there ; and therefore , without any more delay , i went to work with friday to find out a great tree proper to fell , and make a large periagua , or canoe , to undertake the voyage . there were trees enough in the island to have built a little fleet , not of periaguas or canoes , but even of good , large vessels ; but the main thing i looked at was , to get one so near the water that we might launch it when it was made , to avoid the mistake i committed at first .",118
"aramis therefore had written immediately to marie michon , the seamstress at tours who had such fine acquaintances , to obtain from the queen authority for mme . bonacieux to leave the convent , and to retire either into lorraine or belgium .",1
"lord glenarvan , therefore , believed in the fidelity of this man and , by his advice , resolved to cross australia , following the thirty - seventh parallel .",3
"pencroft thought it must be breakfast - time , and the watches of the reporter and engineer were therefore consulted to find out the hour .",18
""" it do n't much matter to you why i hated these men , "" he said ; "" it 's enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings — a father and a daughter — and that they had , therefore , forfeited their own lives . after the lapse of time that has passed since their crime , it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court . i knew of their guilt though , and i determined that i should be judge , jury , and executioner all rolled into one . you 'd have done the same , if you have any manhood in you , if you had been in my place .",45

they were therefore much astonished and delighted in the regiment when they saw the young man come back safe and sound .,2
"it was , therefore , much better to tow it to the beach at granite house .",3

"it was , therefore , reasonable to believe that the engineer 's apprehensions would not be justified , and that the presence of this vessel in the vicinity of the island was fraught with no danger .",3

"harding made arrangements , therefore , for living in the corral , of which the provisions would last for a tolerable length of time .",4
"one of these , concerning which i have said little , is the escaped convict upon the moor . there is strong reason now to believe that he has got right away , which is a considerable relief to the lonely householders of this district . a fortnight has passed since his flight , during which he has not been seen and nothing has been heard of him . it is surely inconceivable that he could have held out upon the moor during all that time . of course , so far as his concealment goes there is no difficulty at all . any one of these stone huts would give him a hiding - place . but there is nothing to eat unless he were to catch and slaughter one of the moor sheep . we think , therefore , that he has gone , and the outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence .",139
"i was on the point of asking him what that work might be , but something in his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one . i pondered over our short conversation , however , and endeavoured to draw my deductions from it . he said that he would acquire no knowledge which did not bear upon his object . therefore all the knowledge which he possessed was such as would be useful to him . i enumerated in my own mind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was exceptionally well - informed . i even took a pencil and jotted them down . i could not help smiling at the document when i had completed it . it ran in this way —",64

"i knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend in those hours of intense mental concentration during which he weighed every particle of evidence , constructed alternative theories , balanced one against the other , and made up his mind as to which points were essential and which immaterial . i therefore spent the day at my club and did not return to baker street until evening . it was nearly nine o'clock when i found myself in the sitting - room once more .",54
