"there , in place of natural wonders , the watery mass offered some thrilling and dreadful scenes to my eyes . in essence , we were then crossing that part of the whole mediterranean so fertile in casualties . from the coast of algiers to the beaches of provence , how many ships have wrecked , how many vessels have vanished ! compared to the vast liquid plains of the pacific , the mediterranean is a mere lake , but it 's an unpredictable lake with fickle waves , today kindly and affectionate to those frail single - masters drifting between a double ultramarine of sky and water , tomorrow bad - tempered and turbulent , agitated by the winds , demolishing the strongest ships beneath sudden waves that smash down with a headlong wallop .",124

"this accident happened around five o'clock in the morning , just as day was beginning to break . the officers on watch rushed to the craft 's stern . they examined the ocean with the most scrupulous care . they saw nothing except a strong eddy breaking three cable lengths out , as if those sheets of water had been violently churned . the site 's exact bearings were taken , and the moravian continued on course apparently undamaged . had it run afoul of an underwater rock or the wreckage of some enormous derelict ship ? they were unable to say . but when they examined its undersides in the service yard , they discovered that part of its keel had been smashed .",95
"as for captain nemo , i wondered what he would make of our escaping , what concern or perhaps what distress it might cause him , and what he would do in the twofold event of our attempt either failing or being found out ! certainly i had no complaints to register with him , on the contrary . never was hospitality more wholehearted than his . yet in leaving him i could n't be accused of ingratitude . no solemn promises bound us to him . in order to keep us captive , he had counted only on the force of circumstances and not on our word of honor . but his avowed intention to imprison us forever on his ship justified our every effort .",121
"then i began to wonder if this eccentric individual was even on board . since that night when the skiff had left the nautilus on some mysterious mission , my ideas about him had subtly changed . in spite of everything , i thought that captain nemo must have kept up some type of relationship with the shore . did he himself never leave the nautilus ? whole weeks had often gone by without my encountering him . what was he doing all the while ? during all those times i 'd thought he was convalescing in the grip of some misanthropic fit , was he instead far away from the ship , involved in some secret activity whose nature still eluded me ?",111
"at 11:45 the sun , by then seen only by refraction , looked like a golden disk , dispersing its last rays over this deserted continent and down to these seas not yet plowed by the ships of man .",36
"this was the last straw , and it resulted in arousing public passions all over again . indeed , from this moment on , any maritime casualty without an established cause was charged to the monster 's account . this outrageous animal had to shoulder responsibility for all derelict vessels , whose numbers are unfortunately considerable , since out of those 3,000 ships whose losses are recorded annually at the marine insurance bureau , the figure for steam or sailing ships supposedly lost with all hands , in the absence of any news , amounts to at least 200 !",62
"i rushed to the window and saw crusts of coral : fungus coral , siphonula coral , alcyon coral , sea anemone from the genus caryophylia , plus myriads of charming fish including greenfish , damselfish , sweepers , snappers , and squirrelfish ; underneath this coral covering i detected some rubble the old dredges had n't been able to tear free-- iron stirrups , anchors , cannons , shells , tackle from a capstan , a stempost , all objects hailing from the wrecked ships and now carpeted in moving flowers .",85
"i followed captain nemo , and as soon as i passed through the doorway , i went down a kind of electrically lit passageway that resembled a gangway on a ship . after a stretch of some ten meters , a second door opened before me .",30
"the canadian leaped up the steps , but i stopped him . a well - known hissing told me that water was entering the ship 's ballast tanks . indeed , in a few moments the nautilus had submerged some meters below the surface of the waves .",24
"around the nautilus for a half - mile radius , the waters seemed saturated with electric light . the sandy bottom was clear and bright . dressed in diving suits , crewmen were busy clearing away half - rotted barrels and disemboweled trunks in the midst of the dingy hulks of ships . out of these trunks and kegs spilled ingots of gold and silver , cascades of jewels , pieces of eight . the sand was heaped with them . then , laden with these valuable spoils , the men returned to the nautilus , dropped off their burdens inside , and went to resume this inexhaustible fishing for silver and gold .",51
"the wind was unfavourable to a species of launch not calculated for shallow water . in many places we were obliged to push ourselves along with iron - pointed sticks . often the sunken rocks just beneath the surface obliged us to deviate from our straight course . at last , after three hours ' sailing , about six in the evening we reached a place suitable for our landing . i jumped ashore , followed by my uncle and the icelander . this short passage had not served to cool my ardour . on the contrary , i even proposed to burn ' our ship , ' to prevent the possibility of return ; but my uncle would not consent to that . i thought him singularly lukewarm .",105
""" surely , but in extracting that silver , your expenses would outweigh your profits . here , by contrast , i have only to pick up what other men have lost , and not only in this bay of vigo but at a thousand other sites where ships have gone down , whose positions are marked on my underwater chart . do you understand now that i 'm rich to the tune of billions ? """,48
"here is what those circumstances entailed . two miles to starboard lay gueboroa island , its coastline curving north to west like an immense arm . to the south and east , heads of coral were already on display , left uncovered by the ebbing waters . we had run aground at full tide and in one of those seas whose tides are moderate , an inconvenient state of affairs for floating the nautilus off . however , the ship had n't suffered in any way , so solidly joined was its hull . but although it could neither sink nor split open , it was in serious danger of being permanently attached to these reefs , and that would have been the finish of captain nemo 's submersible .",79
"from that day forward , who knows where the nautilus took us in the north atlantic basin ? always at incalculable speed ! always amid the high arctic mists ! did it call at the capes of spitzbergen or the shores of novaya zemlya ? did it visit such uncharted seas as the white sea , the kara sea , the gulf of ob , the lyakhov islands , or those unknown beaches on the siberian coast ? i 'm unable to say . i lost track of the passing hours . time was in abeyance on the ship 's clocks . as happens in the polar regions , it seemed that night and day no longer followed their normal sequence . i felt myself being drawn into that strange domain where the overwrought imagination of edgar allan poe was at home . like his fabled arthur gordon pym , i expected any moment to see that "" shrouded human figure , very far larger in its proportions than any dweller among men , "" thrown across the cataract that protects the outskirts of the pole !",98

""",101
"suddenly a slight movement could be felt over the hull . obviously the nautilus was straightening a bit . objects hanging in the lounge were visibly returning to their normal positions . the walls were approaching the vertical . nobody said a word . hearts pounding , we could see and feel the ship righting itself . the floor was becoming horizontal beneath our feet . ten minutes went by .",53
"he paid him beforehand , the two sheep were put on board , and candide followed in a small boat to join the vessel in the road . the skipper took advantage of his opportunity , hoisted sail , and put out to sea with a favorable wind . candide , confounded and amazed , soon lost sight of the ship .",60

"no more shore in sight . nothing but the immenseness of the sea . a few sails were on the horizon , no doubt ships going as far as cape s√£o roque to find favorable winds for doubling the cape of good hope . the sky was overcast . a squall was on the way .",24
suddenly a noise from the ship 's interior became audible . voices were answering each other hurriedly . what was it ? had they spotted our escape ? i felt ned land sliding a dagger into my hand .,5
"but perhaps it had been only his fancy that had called vengeance out of the night and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him . actual life was chaos , but there was something terribly logical in the imagination . it was the imagination that set remorse to dog the feet of sin . it was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen brood . in the common world of fact the wicked were not punished , nor the good rewarded . success was given to the strong , failure thrust upon the weak . that was all . besides , had any stranger been prowling round the house , he would have been seen by the servants or the keepers . had any foot - marks been found on the flower - beds , the gardeners would have reported it . yes , it had been merely fancy . sibyl vane 's brother had not come back to kill him . he had sailed away in his ship to founder in some winter sea . from him , at any rate , he was safe . why , the man did not know who he was , could not know who he was . the mask of youth had saved him .",171
"as you know , at the turn of the tide , the waters confined between the faroe and lofoten islands rush out with irresistible violence . they form a vortex from which no ship has ever been able to escape . monstrous waves race together from every point of the horizon . they form a whirlpool aptly called "" the ocean 's navel , "" whose attracting power extends a distance of fifteen kilometers . it can suck down not only ships but whales , and even polar bears from the northernmost regions .",33
"this was where the nautilus had been sent accidentally-- or perhaps deliberately -- by its captain . it was sweeping around in a spiral whose radius kept growing smaller and smaller . the skiff , still attached to the ship 's plating , was likewise carried around at dizzying speed . i could feel us whirling . i was experiencing that accompanying nausea that follows such continuous spinning motions . we were in dread , in the last stages of sheer horror , our blood frozen in our veins , our nerves numb , drenched in cold sweat as if from the throes of dying ! and what a noise around our frail skiff ! what roars echoing from several miles away ! what crashes from the waters breaking against sharp rocks on the seafloor , where the hardest objects are smashed , where tree trunks are worn down and worked into "" a shaggy fur , "" as norwegians express it !",39
"each took out his glass , and they spied two ships warmly engaged at the distance of about three miles . the wind brought them both so near the french ship that those on board her had the pleasure of seeing the fight with great ease .",10
"the ship 's officers shared the views of their leader . they could be heard chatting , discussing , arguing , calculating the different chances of an encounter , and observing the vast expanse of the ocean . voluntary watches from the crosstrees of the topgallant sail were self - imposed by more than one who would have cursed such toil under any other circumstances . as often as the sun swept over its daily arc , the masts were populated with sailors whose feet itched and could n't hold still on the planking of the deck below ! and the abraham lincoln 's stempost had n't even cut the suspected waters of the pacific .",1
"the french captain quickly perceived that the victorious ship belonged to the crown of spain ; that the other was a dutch pirate , and the very same captain who had robbed candide .",8
"the french and spanish ships continued their cruise , and candide and martin their conversation .",4
"oh , why was i so short of time ! i would have gone down the steep slopes of this mountain , crossed this entire immense continent , which surely connects africa with america , and visited its great prehistoric cities . under my eyes there perhaps lay the warlike town of makhimos or the pious village of eusebes , whose gigantic inhabitants lived for whole centuries and had the strength to raise blocks of stone that still withstood the action of the waters . one day perhaps , some volcanic phenomenon will bring these sunken ruins back to the surface of the waves ! numerous underwater volcanoes have been sighted in this part of the ocean , and many ships have felt terrific tremors when passing over these turbulent depths . a few have heard hollow noises that announced some struggle of the elements far below , others have hauled in volcanic ash hurled above the waves . as far as the equator this whole seafloor is still under construction by plutonic forces . and in some remote epoch , built up by volcanic disgorgings and successive layers of lava , who knows whether the peaks of these fire - belching mountains may reappear above the surface of the atlantic !",120
""" wooden ships maybe , "" the canadian replied . "" but i 've never seen the like . so till i have proof to the contrary , i 'll deny that baleen whales , sperm whales , or unicorns can do any such thing . """,2
""" at my command . an electric wire connects me to the ship . i fire off a telegram , and that 's that . """,12
"this stream of electricity dazzled my eyes , and after momentarily shutting them , i looked around . the nautilus was stationary . it was floating next to an embankment shaped like a wharf . as for the water now buoying the ship , it was a lake completely encircled by an inner wall about two miles in diameter , hence six miles around . its level -- as indicated by the pressure gauge -- would be the same as the outside level , because some connection had to exist between this lake and the sea . slanting inward over their base , these high walls converged to form a vault shaped like an immense upside - down funnel that measured 500 or 600 meters in height . at its summit there gaped the circular opening through which i had detected that faint glimmer , obviously daylight .",42
"an apt remark . for who could predict the minimum time we would need to free ourselves ? before the nautilus could return to the surface of the waves , could n't we all die of asphyxiation ? were this ship and everyone on board doomed to perish in this tomb of ice ? it was a dreadful state of affairs . but we faced it head - on , each one of us determined to do his duty to the end .",40
""" here , professor aronnax , are the different dimensions of this boat now transporting you . it 's a very long cylinder with conical ends . it noticeably takes the shape of a cigar , a shape already adopted in london for several projects of the same kind . the length of this cylinder from end to end is exactly seventy meters , and its maximum breadth of beam is eight meters . so it is n't quite built on the ten - to - one ratio of your high - speed steamers ; but its lines are sufficiently long , and their tapering gradual enough , so that the displaced water easily slips past and poses no obstacle to the ship 's movements .",122
""" the nautilus is made up of two hulls , one inside the other ; between them , joining them together , are iron t - bars that give this ship the utmost rigidity . in fact , thanks to this cellular arrangement , it has the resistance of a stone block , as if it were completely solid . its plating ca n't give way ; it 's self - adhering and not dependent on the tightness of its rivets ; and due to the perfect union of its materials , the solidarity of its construction allows it to defy the most violent seas .",30
"off the falkland islands on june 30 , the frigate came in contact with a fleet of american whalers , and we learned that they had n't seen the narwhale . but one of them , the captain of the monroe , knew that ned land had shipped aboard the abraham lincoln and asked his help in hunting a baleen whale that was in sight . anxious to see ned land at work , commander farragut authorized him to make his way aboard the monroe . and the canadian had such good luck that with a right - and - left shot , he harpooned not one whale but two , striking the first straight to the heart and catching the other after a few minutes ' chase !",47
"i broke out in a cold sweat . but why should i have been startled by this reply ? on march 22 the nautilus had dived under the open waters at the pole . it was now the 26th . we had lived off the ship 's stores for five days ! and all remaining breathable air had to be saved for the workmen . even today as i write these lines , my sensations are so intense that an involuntary terror sweeps over me , and my lungs still seem short of air !",45
"the next day , january 30 , when the nautilus rose to the surface of the ocean , there was no more land in sight . setting its course to the north - northwest , the ship headed toward the gulf of oman , carved out between arabia and the indian peninsula and providing access to the persian gulf .",36
"that day the usual work was accomplished with even greater energy . over the whole surface area , only two meters were left to be removed . only two meters separated us from the open sea . but the ship 's air tanks were nearly empty . the little air that remained had to be saved for the workmen . not an atom for the nautilus !",39
"at certain turns in the trail we were going along , the lake appeared in its full expanse . the ship 's beacon lit up that whole placid surface , which experienced neither ripples nor undulations . the nautilus lay perfectly still . on its platform and on the embankment , crewmen were bustling around , black shadows that stood out clearly in the midst of the luminous air .",20
"then our ship went along at a distance of six miles from the arabic coasts of mahra and hadhramaut , their undulating lines of mountains relieved by a few ancient ruins . on february 5 we finally put into the gulf of aden , a genuine funnel stuck into the neck of bab el mandeb and bottling these indian waters in the red sea .",2
""" perfectly familiar . during the easterly monsoon season , birds of paradise lose the magnificent feathers around their tails that naturalists call ' below - the - wing ' feathers . these feathers are gathered by the fowl forgers and skillfully fitted onto some poor previously mutilated parakeet . then they paint over the suture , varnish the bird , and ship the fruits of their unique labors to museums and collectors in europe . """,62
"i would not even attempt to understand the whim that induced captain nemo to take us into this gulf . but i wholeheartedly approved of the nautilus 's entering it . it adopted a medium pace , sometimes staying on the surface , sometimes diving to avoid some ship , and so i could observe both the inside and topside of this highly unusual sea .",48
"then the nautilus drew near the beaches of africa , where the sea is considerably deeper . there , through the open panels and in a midwater of crystal clarity , our ship enabled us to study wonderful bushes of shining coral and huge chunks of rock wrapped in splendid green furs of algae and fucus . what an indescribable sight , and what a variety of settings and scenery where these reefs and volcanic islands leveled off by the libyan coast ! but soon the nautilus hugged the eastern shore where these tree forms appeared in all their glory . this was off the coast of tihama , and there such zoophyte displays not only flourished below sea level but they also fashioned picturesque networks that unreeled as high as ten fathoms above it ; the latter were more whimsical but less colorful than the former , which kept their bloom thanks to the moist vitality of the waters .",32
"properly speaking , the sargasso sea covers every submerged part of atlantis . certain authors have even held that the many weeds strewn over this sea were torn loose from the prairies of that ancient continent . but it 's more likely that these grasses , algae , and fucus plants were carried off from the beaches of europe and america , then taken as far as this zone by the gulf stream . this is one of the reasons why christopher columbus assumed the existence of a new world . when the ships of that bold investigator arrived in the sargasso sea , they had great difficulty navigating in the midst of these weeds , which , much to their crews ' dismay , slowed them down to a halt ; and they wasted three long weeks crossing this sector .",93
"the platform emerged only eighty centimeters above the waves . the nautilus 's bow and stern boasted that spindle - shaped outline that had caused the ship to be compared appropriately to a long cigar . i noted the slight overlap of its sheet - iron plates , which resembled the scales covering the bodies of our big land reptiles . so i had a perfectly natural explanation for why , despite the best spyglasses , this boat had always been mistaken for a marine animal .",26
"i share maury 's view , and i was able to study the phenomenon in this exclusive setting where ships rarely go . above us , huddled among the brown weeds , there floated objects originating from all over : tree trunks ripped from the rocky mountains or the andes and sent floating down the amazon or the mississippi , numerous pieces of wreckage , remnants of keels or undersides , bulwarks staved in and so weighed down with seashells and barnacles , they could n't rise to the surface of the ocean . and the passing years will someday bear out maury 's other view that by collecting in this way over the centuries , these substances will be turned to stone by the action of the waters and will then form inexhaustible coalfields . valuable reserves prepared by farseeing nature for that time when man will have exhausted his mines on the continents .",19
"so ned land had good reason to worry . in these wide seas empty of islands , it was no longer feasible to jump ship . nor did we have any way to counter captain nemo 's whims . we had no choice but to acquiesce ; but if we could n't attain our end through force or cunning , i liked to think we might achieve it through persuasion . once this voyage was over , might not captain nemo consent to set us free in return for our promise never to reveal his existence ? our word of honor , which we sincerely would have kept . however , this delicate question would have to be negotiated with the captain . but how would he receive our demands for freedom ? at the very outset and in no uncertain terms , had n't he declared that the secret of his life required that we be permanently imprisoned on board the nautilus ? would n't he see my four - month silence as a tacit acceptance of this situation ? would my returning to this subject arouse suspicions that could jeopardize our escape plans , if we had promising circumstances for trying again later on ? i weighed all these considerations , turned them over in my mind , submitted them to conseil , but he was as baffled as i was . in short , although i 'm not easily discouraged , i realized that my chances of ever seeing my fellow men again were shrinking by the day , especially at a time when captain nemo was recklessly racing toward the south atlantic !",24
"at dawn on the 13th the carnatic entered the port of yokohama . this is an important port of call in the pacific , where all the mail - steamers , and those carrying travellers between north america , china , japan , and the oriental islands put in . it is situated in the bay of yeddo , and at but a short distance from that second capital of the japanese empire , and the residence of the tycoon , the civil emperor , before the mikado , the spiritual emperor , absorbed his office in his own . the carnatic anchored at the quay near the custom - house , in the midst of a crowd of ships bearing the flags of all nations .",119
"upon their arrival at venice candide went in search of cacambo at every inn and coffee - house , and among all the ladies of pleasure , but could hear nothing of him . he sent every day to inquire what ships were in , still no news of cacambo .",41
"twenty minutes later we boarded ship . the hatches were open . after mooring the skiff , we reentered the nautilus 's interior .",5
""" it 's true , "" i replied . "" your ship is a century ahead of its time , perhaps several centuries . it would be most unfortunate if such a secret were to die with its inventor ! """,11
"under this powerful thrust the nautilus 's hull quivered like a resonating chord , and the ship sank steadily under the waters . stationed in the lounge , the captain and i watched the needle swerving swiftly over the pressure gauge . soon we had gone below the livable zone where most fish reside . some of these animals can thrive only at the surface of seas or rivers , but a minority can dwell at fairly great depths . among the latter i observed a species of dogfish called the cow shark that 's equipped with six respiratory slits , the telescope fish with its enormous eyes , the armored gurnard with gray thoracic fins plus black pectoral fins and a breastplate protected by pale red slabs of bone , then finally the grenadier , living at a depth of 1,200 meters , by that point tolerating a pressure of 120 atmospheres .",16
"but , if he thought of these possibilities , he did not betray the fact by any outward sign . always the same impassible member of the reform club , whom no incident could surprise , as unvarying as the ship 's chronometers , and seldom having the curiosity even to go upon the deck , he passed through the memorable scenes of the red sea with cold indifference ; did not care to recognise the historic towns and villages which , along its borders , raised their picturesque outlines against the sky ; and betrayed no fear of the dangers of the arabic gulf , which the old historians always spoke of with horror , and upon which the ancient navigators never ventured without propitiating the gods by ample sacrifices . how did this eccentric personage pass his time on the mongolia ? he made his four hearty meals every day , regardless of the most persistent rolling and pitching on the part of the steamer ; and he played whist indefatigably , for he had found partners as enthusiastic in the game as himself .",40
"going back under the waters , the nautilus drew near the coast , cruising along it for only a few miles . through the lounge windows i could see long creepers and gigantic fucus plants , bulb - bearing seaweed of which the open sea at the pole had revealed a few specimens ; with their smooth , viscous filaments , they measured as much as 300 meters long ; genuine cables more than an inch thick and very tough , they 're often used as mooring lines for ships . another weed , known by the name velp and boasting four - foot leaves , was crammed into the coral concretions and carpeted the ocean floor . it served as both nest and nourishment for myriads of crustaceans and mollusks , for crabs and cuttlefish . here seals and otters could indulge in a sumptuous meal , mixing meat from fish with vegetables from the sea , like the english with their irish stews .",89
"suddenly , through two oblong openings , daylight appeared on both sides of the lounge . the liquid masses came into view , brightly lit by the ship 's electric outpourings . we were separated from the sea by two panes of glass . initially i shuddered at the thought that these fragile partitions could break ; but strong copper bands secured them , giving them nearly infinite resistance .",27
"the nautilus seemed to be standing still . this was due to the lack of landmarks . but streaks of water , parted by the ship 's spur , sometimes threaded before our eyes with extraordinary speed .",25
"towards evening the mate and boatswain begged the master of our ship to let them cut away the fore - mast , which he was very unwilling to do ; but the boatswain protesting to him that if he did not the ship would founder , he consented ; and when they had cut away the fore - mast , the main - mast stood so loose , and shook the ship so much , they were obliged to cut that away also , and make a clear deck .",11

"we were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship till we saw her sink , and then i understood for the first time what was meant by a ship foundering in the sea . i must acknowledge i had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told me she was sinking ; for from the moment that they rather put me into the boat than that i might be said to go in , my heart was , as it were , dead within me , partly with fright , partly with horror of mind , and the thoughts of what was yet before me .",34
"for two hours our fishing proceeded energetically but without bringing up any rarities . our dragnet was filled with midas abalone , harp shells , obelisk snails , and especially the finest hammer shells i had seen to that day . we also gathered in a few sea cucumbers , some pearl oysters , and a dozen small turtles that we saved for the ship 's pantry .",64
""" it seems to me , "" ned land went on , "" that it would n't take much of a crew to run a ship like this one . """,25
"after about two years , an odd circumstance presented itself , which put the old thought of making some attempt for my liberty again in my head . my patron lying at home longer than usual without fitting out his ship , which , as i heard , was for want of money , he used constantly , once or twice a week , sometimes oftener if the weather was fair , to take the ship ‚Äôs pinnace and go out into the road a - fishing ; and as he always took me and young maresco with him to row the boat , we made him very merry , and i proved very dexterous in catching fish ; insomuch that sometimes he would send me with a moor , one of his kinsmen , and the youth ‚Äî the maresco , as they called him ‚Äî to catch a dish of fish for him .",40
"about twelve , immense shoals of seaweeds came in sight . i was aware of the great powers of vegetation that characterise these plants , which grow at a depth of twelve thousand feet , reproduce themselves under a pressure of four hundred atmospheres , and sometimes form barriers strong enough to impede the course of a ship . but never , i think , were such seaweeds as those which we saw floating in immense waving lines upon the sea of liedenbrock .",57
"my first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this moor , to get something for our subsistence on board ; for i told him we must not presume to eat of our patron ‚Äôs bread . he said that was true ; so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit , and three jars of fresh water , into the boat . i knew where my patron ‚Äôs case of bottles stood , which it was evident , by the make , were taken out of some english prize , and i conveyed them into the boat while the moor was on shore , as if they had been there before for our master . i conveyed also a great lump of beeswax into the boat , which weighed about half a hundred - weight , with a parcel of twine or thread , a hatchet , a saw , and a hammer , all of which were of great use to us afterwards , especially the wax , to make candles . another trick i tried upon him , which he innocently came into also : his name was ismael , which they call muley , or moely ; so i called to him‚Äî‚Äúmoely , ‚Äù said i , ‚Äú our patron ‚Äôs guns are on board the boat ; can you not get a little powder and shot ? it may be we may kill some alcamies ( a fowl like our curlews ) for ourselves , for i know he keeps the gunner ‚Äôs stores in the ship . ‚Äù ‚Äú yes , ‚Äù says he , ‚Äú i ‚Äôll bring some ; ‚Äù and accordingly he brought a great leather pouch , which held a pound and a half of powder , or rather more ; and another with shot , that had five or six pounds , with some bullets , and put all into the boat . at the same time i had found some powder of my master ‚Äôs in the great cabin , with which i filled one of the large bottles in the case , which was almost empty , pouring what was in it into another ; and thus furnished with everything needful , we sailed out of the port to fish . the castle , which is at the entrance of the port , knew who we were , and took no notice of us ; and we were not above a mile out of the port before we hauled in our sail and set us down to fish . the wind blew from the n.n.e . , which was contrary to my desire , for had it blown southerly i had been sure to have made the coast of spain , and at least reached to the bay of cadiz ; but my resolutions were , blow which way it would , i would be gone from that horrid place where i was , and leave the rest to fate .",265
"there once more , through the panels opening into these caribbean waters ten meters below the surface of the waves , i found so many fascinating exhibits to describe in my daily notes ! among other zoophytes there were portuguese men - of - war known by the name physalia pelagica , like big , oblong bladders with a pearly sheen , spreading their membranes to the wind , letting their blue tentacles drift like silken threads ; to the eye delightful jellyfish , to the touch actual nettles that ooze a corrosive liquid . among the articulates there were annelid worms one and a half meters long , furnished with a pink proboscis , equipped with 1,700 organs of locomotion , snaking through the waters , and as they went , throwing off every gleam in the solar spectrum . from the fish branch there were manta rays , enormous cartilaginous fish ten feet long and weighing 600 pounds , their pectoral fin triangular , their midback slightly arched , their eyes attached to the edges of the face at the front of the head ; they floated like wreckage from a ship , sometimes fastening onto our windows like opaque shutters . there were american triggerfish for which nature has ground only black and white pigments , feather - shaped gobies that were long and plump with yellow fins and jutting jaws , sixteen - decimeter mackerel with short , sharp teeth , covered with small scales , and related to the albacore species . next came swarms of red mullet corseted in gold stripes from head to tail , their shining fins all aquiver , genuine masterpieces of jewelry , formerly sacred to the goddess diana , much in demand by rich romans , and about which the old saying goes : "" he who catches them does n't eat them ! "" finally , adorned with emerald ribbons and dressed in velvet and silk , golden angelfish passed before our eyes like courtiers in the paintings of veronese ; spurred gilthead stole by with their swift thoracic fins ; thread herring fifteen inches long were wrapped in their phosphorescent glimmers ; gray mullet thrashed the sea with their big fleshy tails ; red salmon seemed to mow the waves with their slicing pectorals ; and silver moonfish , worthy of their name , rose on the horizon of the waters like the whitish reflections of many moons .",193

"it is true i had been very unfortunate by sea , and this might be one of the reasons ; but let no man slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts in cases of such moment : two of the ships which i had singled out to go in , i mean more particularly singled out than any other , having put my things on board one of them , and in the other having agreed with the captain ; i say two of these ships miscarried . one was taken by the algerines , and the other was lost on the start , near torbay , and all the people drowned except three ; so that in either of those vessels i had been made miserable .",86
"in fact , i had already resorted to speeding up my inhalations in order to extract from the cell what little oxygen it contained , when suddenly i was refreshed by a current of clean air , scented with a salty aroma . it had to be a sea breeze , life - giving and charged with iodine ! i opened my mouth wide , and my lungs glutted themselves on the fresh particles . at the same time , i felt a swaying , a rolling of moderate magnitude but definitely noticeable . this boat , this sheet - iron monster , had obviously just risen to the surface of the ocean , there to breathe in good whale fashion . so the ship 's mode of ventilation was finally established .",124
"equipped with picks , some ten men climbed onto the nautilus 's sides and cracked loose the ice around the ship 's lower plating , which was soon set free . this operation was swiftly executed because the fresh ice was still thin . we all reentered the interior . the main ballast tanks were filled with the water that had n't yet congealed at our line of flotation . the nautilus submerged without delay .",20
"as i said , the nautilus veered to the east . to be more accurate , i should have said to the northeast . sometimes on the surface of the waves , sometimes beneath them , the ship wandered for days amid these mists so feared by navigators . these are caused chiefly by melting ice , which keeps the air extremely damp . how many ships have perished in these waterways as they tried to get directions from the hazy lights on the coast ! how many casualties have been caused by these opaque mists ! how many collisions have occurred with these reefs , where the breaking surf is covered by the noise of the wind ! how many vessels have rammed each other , despite their running lights , despite the warnings given by their bosun 's pipes and alarm bells !",37
"during the night the ship might disappear and leave for ever , and , this ship gone , would another ever return to the waters of lincoln island ?",15
""" so count them , conseil . but it would be less work to believe me . besides , frenchmen , englishmen , americans , danes , and norwegians catch these cod by the thousands . they 're eaten in prodigious quantities , and without the astonishing fertility of these fish , the seas would soon be depopulated of them . accordingly , in england and america alone , 5,000 ships manned by 75,000 seamen go after cod . each ship brings back an average catch of 4,400 fish , making 22,000,000 . off the coast of norway , the total is the same . """,70
finally the ship 's rays appeared . their luminous trail guided us to the nautilus . by one o'clock we had returned .,2
but it was imperative that the ship should be ready to receive them before the inevitable catastrophe should arrive .,6
""" and perhaps at this very moment there is a storm above , and ships over our heads are being rudely tossed by the tempest . """,14
"there the ocean floor formed a valley 120 kilometers wide , into which you could fit mt . blanc without its summit poking above the surface of the waves . this valley is closed off to the east by a sheer wall 2,000 meters high . we arrived there on may 28 , and the nautilus lay no farther than 150 kilometers from ireland . would captain nemo head up north and beach us on the british isles ? no . much to my surprise , he went back down south and returned to european seas . as we swung around the emerald isle , i spotted cape clear for an instant , plus the lighthouse on fastnet rock that guides all those thousands of ships setting out from glasgow or liverpool .",125
"the nautilus kept to its southeasterly heading . on december 1 it cut the equator at longitude 142 degrees , and on the 4th of the same month , after a quick crossing marked by no incident , we raised the marquesas islands . three miles off , in latitude 8 degrees 57 ' south and longitude 139 degrees 32 ' west , i spotted martin point on nuku hiva , chief member of this island group that belongs to france . i could make out only its wooded mountains on the horizon , because captain nemo hated to hug shore . there our nets brought up some fine fish samples : dolphinfish with azure fins , gold tails , and flesh that 's unrivaled in the entire world , wrasse from the genus hologymnosus that were nearly denuded of scales but exquisite in flavor , knifejaws with bony beaks , yellowish albacore that were as tasty as bonito , all fish worth classifying in the ship 's pantry .",166
"all in all , we enjoyed a highly satisfactory state of health . the diet on board agreed with us perfectly , and for my part , i could easily have gone without those changes of pace that ned land , in a spirit of protest , kept taxing his ingenuity to supply us . what 's more , in this constant temperature we did n't even have to worry about catching colds . besides , the ship had a good stock of the madrepore dendrophylia , known in provence by the name sea fennel , and a poultice made from the dissolved flesh of its polyps will furnish an excellent cough medicine .",77
"in the midst of the watery mass , brightly lit by our electric beams , there snaked past those one - meter lampreys that are common to nearly every clime . a type of ray from the genus oxyrhynchus , five feet wide , had a white belly with a spotted , ash - gray back and was carried along by the currents like a huge , wide - open shawl . other rays passed by so quickly i could n't tell if they deserved that name "" eagle ray "" coined by the ancient greeks , or those designations of "" rat ray , "" "" bat ray , "" and "" toad ray "" that modern fishermen have inflicted on them . dogfish known as topes , twelve feet long and especially feared by divers , were racing with each other . looking like big bluish shadows , thresher sharks went by , eight feet long and gifted with an extremely acute sense of smell . dorados from the genus sparus , some measuring up to thirteen decimeters , appeared in silver and azure costumes encircled with ribbons , which contrasted with the dark color of their fins ; fish sacred to the goddess venus , their eyes set in brows of gold ; a valuable species that patronizes all waters fresh or salt , equally at home in rivers , lakes , and oceans , living in every clime , tolerating any temperature , their line dating back to prehistoric times on this earth yet preserving all its beauty from those far - off days . magnificent sturgeons , nine to ten meters long and extremely fast , banged their powerful tails against the glass of our panels , showing bluish backs with small brown spots ; they resemble sharks , without equaling their strength , and are encountered in every sea ; in the spring they delight in swimming up the great rivers , fighting the currents of the volga , danube , po , rhine , loire , and oder , while feeding on herring , mackerel , salmon , and codfish ; although they belong to the class of cartilaginous fish , they rate as a delicacy ; they 're eaten fresh , dried , marinated , or salt - preserved , and in olden times they were borne in triumph to the table of the roman epicure lucullus . but whenever the nautilus drew near the surface , those denizens of the mediterranean i could observe most productively belonged to the sixty - third genus of bony fish . these were tuna from the genus scomber , blue - black on top , silver on the belly armor , their dorsal stripes giving off a golden gleam . they are said to follow ships in search of refreshing shade from the hot tropical sun , and they did just that with the nautilus , as they had once done with the vessels of the count de la p√©rouse . for long hours they competed in speed with our submersible . i could n't stop marveling at these animals so perfectly cut out for racing , their heads small , their bodies sleek , spindle - shaped , and in some cases over three meters long , their pectoral fins gifted with remarkable strength , their caudal fins forked . like certain flocks of birds , whose speed they equal , these tuna swim in triangle formation , which prompted the ancients to say they 'd boned up on geometry and military strategy . and yet they ca n't escape the proven√ßal fishermen , who prize them as highly as did the ancient inhabitants of turkey and italy ; and these valuable animals , as oblivious as if they were deaf and blind , leap right into the marseilles tuna nets and perish by the thousands .",470
"as for our neglect , our isolation in the depths of this cell , i was afraid to guess at how long it might last . little by little , hopes i had entertained after our interview with the ship 's commander were fading away . the gentleness of the man 's gaze , the generosity expressed in his facial features , the nobility of his bearing , all vanished from my memory . i saw this mystifying individual anew for what he inevitably must be : cruel and merciless . i viewed him as outside humanity , beyond all feelings of compassion , the implacable foe of his fellow man , toward whom he must have sworn an undying hate !",39
"for about an hour the nautilus cruised in the midst of this school of mollusks . then , lord knows why , they were gripped with a sudden fear . as if at a signal , every sail was abruptly lowered ; arms folded , bodies contracted , shells turned over by changing their center of gravity , and the whole flotilla disappeared under the waves . it was instantaneous , and no squadron of ships ever maneuvered with greater togetherness .",75
it was the ship 's commander who had just spoken .,3
