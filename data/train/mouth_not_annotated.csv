"he threw himself into a chair and began to think . suddenly there flashed across his mind what he had said in basil hallward 's studio the day the picture had been finished . yes , he remembered it perfectly . he had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain young , and the portrait grow old ; that his own beauty might be untarnished , and the face on the canvas bear the burden of his passions and his sins ; that the painted image might be seared with the lines of suffering and thought , and that he might keep all the delicate bloom and loveliness of his then just conscious boyhood . surely his wish had not been fulfilled ? such things were impossible . it seemed monstrous even to think of them . and , yet , there was the picture before him , with the touch of cruelty in the mouth .",157

"often , on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were his friends , or thought that they were so , he himself would creep upstairs to the locked room , open the door with the key that never left him now , and stand , with a mirror , in front of the portrait that basil hallward had painted of him , looking now at the evil and aging face on the canvas , and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him from the polished glass . the very sharpness of the contrast used to quicken his sense of pleasure . he grew more and more enamoured of his own beauty , more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul . he would examine with minute care , and sometimes with a monstrous and terrible delight , the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth , wondering sometimes which were the more horrible , the signs of sin or the signs of age . he would place his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture , and smile . he mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs .",172
"finally , to conclude , conseil classified a large number of flying fish . nothing could have made a more unusual sight than the marvelous timing with which dolphins hunt these fish . whatever the range of its flight , however evasive its trajectory ( even up and over the nautilus ) , the hapless flying fish always found a dolphin to welcome it with open mouth . these were either flying gurnards or kitelike sea robins , whose lips glowed in the dark , at night scrawling fiery streaks in the air before plunging into the murky waters like so many shooting stars .",66

"during the course of the next day , april 12 , the nautilus drew near the coast of dutch guiana , by the mouth of the maroni river . there several groups of sea cows were living in family units . these were manatees , which belong to the order sirenia , like the dugong and steller 's sea cow . harmless and unaggressive , these fine animals were six to seven meters long and must have weighed at least 4,000 kilograms each . i told ned land and conseil that farseeing nature had given these mammals a major role to play . in essence , manatees , like seals , are designed to graze the underwater prairies , destroying the clusters of weeds that obstruct the mouths of tropical rivers .",127

"while i was in view of the moor that was swimming , i stood out directly to sea with the boat , rather stretching to windward , that they might think me gone towards the straits ’ mouth ( as indeed any one that had been in their wits must have been supposed to do ) : for who would have supposed we were sailed on to the southward , to the truly barbarian coast , where whole nations of negroes were sure to surround us with their canoes and destroy us ; where we could not go on shore but we should be devoured by savage beasts , or more merciless savages of human kind .",37
"yet such was the fright i had taken of the moors , and the dreadful apprehensions i had of falling into their hands , that i would not stop , or go on shore , or come to an anchor ; the wind continuing fair till i had sailed in that manner five days ; and then the wind shifting to the southward , i concluded also that if any of our vessels were in chase of me , they also would now give over ; so i ventured to make to the coast , and came to an anchor in the mouth of a little river , i knew not what , nor where , neither what latitude , what country , what nation , or what river . i neither saw , nor desired to see any people ; the principal thing i wanted was fresh water . we came into this creek in the evening , resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark , and discover the country ; but as soon as it was quite dark , we heard such dreadful noises of the barking , roaring , and howling of wild creatures , of we knew not what kinds , that the poor boy was ready to die with fear , and begged of me not to go on shore till day .",102

"for two hours a whole aquatic army escorted the nautilus . in the midst of their leaping and cavorting , while they competed with each other in beauty , radiance , and speed , i could distinguish some green wrasse , bewhiskered mullet marked with pairs of black lines , white gobies from the genus eleotris with curved caudal fins and violet spots on the back , wonderful japanese mackerel from the genus scomber with blue bodies and silver heads , glittering azure goldfish whose name by itself gives their full description , several varieties of porgy or gilthead ( some banded gilthead with fins variously blue and yellow , some with horizontal heraldic bars and enhanced by a black strip around their caudal area , some with color zones and elegantly corseted in their six waistbands ) , trumpetfish with flutelike beaks that looked like genuine seafaring woodcocks and were sometimes a meter long , japanese salamanders , serpentine moray eels from the genus echidna that were six feet long with sharp little eyes and a huge mouth bristling with teeth ; etc .",178

"it was a squid of colossal dimensions , fully eight meters long . it was traveling backward with tremendous speed in the same direction as the nautilus . it gazed with enormous , staring eyes that were tinted sea green . its eight arms ( or more accurately , feet ) were rooted in its head , which has earned these animals the name cephalopod ; its arms stretched a distance twice the length of its body and were writhing like the serpentine hair of the furies . you could plainly see its 250 suckers , arranged over the inner sides of its tentacles and shaped like semispheric capsules . sometimes these suckers fastened onto the lounge window by creating vacuums against it . the monster 's mouth -- a beak made of horn and shaped like that of a parrot -- opened and closed vertically . its tongue , also of horn substance and armed with several rows of sharp teeth , would flicker out from between these genuine shears . what a freak of nature ! a bird 's beak on a mollusk ! its body was spindle - shaped and swollen in the middle , a fleshy mass that must have weighed 20,000 to 25,000 kilograms . its unstable color would change with tremendous speed as the animal grew irritated , passing successively from bluish gray to reddish brown .",127

"this homeric slaughter dragged on for an hour , and the long - skulled predators could n't get away . several times ten or twelve of them teamed up , trying to crush the nautilus with their sheer mass . through the windows you could see their enormous mouths paved with teeth , their fearsome eyes . losing all self - control , ned land hurled threats and insults at them . you could feel them clinging to the submersible like hounds atop a wild boar in the underbrush . but by forcing the pace of its propeller , the nautilus carried them off , dragged them under , or brought them back to the upper level of the waters , untroubled by their enormous weight or their powerful grip .",48
