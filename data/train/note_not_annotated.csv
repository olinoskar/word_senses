"extending over an expanse of 100 leagues north to south , and over 90 leagues east to west , this island group lies between latitude 2 degrees and 6 degrees south , and between longitude 174 degrees and 179 degrees west . it consists of a number of islands , islets , and reefs , among which we noted the islands of viti levu , vanua levu , and kadavu .",58
"i went looking in the library for a book about this island , one of the most fertile in the world . sure enough , i found a volume entitled ceylon and the singhalese by h. c. sirr , esq . reentering the lounge , i first noted the bearings of ceylon , on which antiquity lavished so many different names . it was located between latitude 5 degrees 55 ' and 9 degrees 49 ' north , and between longitude 79 degrees 42 ' and 82 degrees 4 ' east of the meridian of greenwich ; its length is 275 miles ; its maximum width , 150 miles ; its circumference , 900 miles ; its surface area , 24,448 square miles , in other words , a little smaller than that of ireland .",47
"he placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed with a ring , and gave the billet to kitty .",10
""" on that note , professor , "" captain nemo told me , "" you and your companions will visit the mannar oysterbank , and if by chance some eager fisherman arrives early , well , we can watch him at work . """,3
"so captain dumont d'urville had put to sea in command of a vessel named after the astrolabe , and just two months after dillon had left vanikoro , dumont d'urville dropped anchor before hobart . there he heard about dillon 's findings , and he further learned that a certain james hobbs , chief officer on the union out of calcutta , had put to shore on an island located in latitude 8 degrees 18 ' south and longitude 156 degrees 30 ' east , and had noted the natives of those waterways making use of iron bars and red fabrics .",87
"i also noted long , whitish strings of salps , a type of mollusk found in clusters , and some jellyfish of large size that swayed in the eddies of the billows .",2
"lestrade glanced at his note - book . "" john rance , "" he said . "" he is off duty now . you will find him at 46 , audley court , kennington park gate . """,4
holmes took a note of the address .,3
"i would have been deeply interested in visiting this long , 360-league reef , against which the ever - surging sea broke with the fearsome intensity of thunderclaps . but just then the nautilus 's slanting fins took us to great depths , and i could see nothing of those high coral walls . i had to rest content with the various specimens of fish brought up by our nets . among others i noted some long - finned albacore , a species in the genus scomber , as big as tuna , bluish on the flanks , and streaked with crosswise stripes that disappear when the animal dies . these fish followed us in schools and supplied our table with very dainty flesh . we also caught a large number of yellow - green gilthead , half a decimeter long and tasting like dorado , plus some flying gurnards , authentic underwater swallows that , on dark nights , alternately streak air and water with their phosphorescent glimmers . among mollusks and zoophytes , i found in our trawl 's meshes various species of alcyonarian coral , sea urchins , hammer shells , spurred - star shells , wentletrap snails , horn shells , glass snails . the local flora was represented by fine floating algae : sea tangle , and kelp from the genus macrocystis , saturated with the mucilage their pores perspire , from which i selected a wonderful nemastoma geliniaroidea , classifying it with the natural curiosities in the museum .",74
""" note it then , my dear spilett ; for it appears proved that the presence of the eucalyptus is enough to neutralize miasmas .",1
"he also had been in all the battles , in the first rank , revolver in one hand , note - book in the other ; grape - shot never made his pencil tremble .",19
"i took one last look at the natural wonders and artistic treasures amassed in the museum , this unrivaled collection doomed to perish someday in the depths of the seas , together with its curator . i wanted to establish one supreme impression in my mind . i stayed there an hour , basking in the aura of the ceiling lights , passing in review the treasures shining in their glass cases . then i returned to my stateroom . there i dressed in sturdy seafaring clothes . i gathered my notes and packed them tenderly about my person . my heart was pounding mightily . i could n't curb its pulsations . my anxiety and agitation would certainly have given me away if captain nemo had seen me .",91
"the last words in his note - book were these : "" a southern rifleman has just taken aim at me , but-- "" the southerner notwithstanding missed gideon spilett , who , with his usual fortune , came out of this affair without a scratch .",5
"i went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning 's conversation for holmes . it was evident to me that he had been very busy of late , for the notes which i had from baker street were few and short , with no comments upon the information which i had supplied and hardly any reference to my mission . no doubt his blackmailing case is absorbing all his faculties . and yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his interest . i wish that he were here .",36
"the reporter , to whom his tedious captivity did not offer a single incident worthy of note , could stand it no longer .",16
"miss gryce snored at last ; she was a heavy welshwoman , and till now her habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light than as a nuisance ; to - night i hailed the first deep notes with satisfaction ; i was debarrassed of interruption ; my half - effaced thought instantly revived .",42
"i mean the breadfruit tree , which is quite abundant on gueboroa island , and there i chiefly noted the seedless variety that in malaysia is called "" rima . """,18
"feverish with vain labour , i got up and took a turn in the room ; undrew the curtain , noted a star or two , shivered with cold , and again crept to bed .",20
"they found him holding his leave of absence in one hand , and m. de treville ’s note in the other .",17
"his reserve had been always excessive and habitual . i was aware , however , that his very ancient family had been noted , time out of mind , for a peculiar sensibility of temperament , displaying itself , through long ages , in many works of exalted art , and manifested , of late , in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity , as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies , perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognizable beauties , of musical science .",22
"a note was accordingly addressed to that lady , who returned for answer , that "" i might do as i pleased : she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs . """,1
"during the night , in line with my forecasts , a new one - meter slice was removed from this immense socket . but in the morning , wearing my diving suit , i was crossing through the liquid mass in a temperature of -6 degrees to -7 degrees centigrade , when i noted that little by little the side walls were closing in on each other . the liquid strata farthest from the trench , not warmed by the movements of workmen and tools , were showing a tendency to solidify . in the face of this imminent new danger , what would happen to our chances for salvation , and how could we prevent this liquid medium from solidifying , then cracking the nautilus 's hull like glass ?",53
"thus m. de treville was praised to the highest note by these men , who adored him , and who , ruffians as they were , trembled before him like scholars before their master , obedient to his least word , and ready to sacrifice themselves to wash out the smallest insult .",9
""" when i wanted to determine what increase in weight the nautilus needed to be given in order to submerge , i had only to take note of the proportionate reduction in volume that salt water experiences in deeper and deeper strata . """,26
"these dates were inscribed in an itinerary divided into columns , indicating the month , the day of the month , and the day for the stipulated and actual arrivals at each principal point paris , brindisi , suez , bombay , calcutta , singapore , hong kong , yokohama , san francisco , new york , and london -- from the 2nd of october to the 21st of december ; and giving a space for setting down the gain made or the loss suffered on arrival at each locality . this methodical record thus contained an account of everything needed , and mr . fogg always knew whether he was behind - hand or in advance of his time . on this friday , october 9th , he noted his arrival at suez , and observed that he had as yet neither gained nor lost . he sat down quietly to breakfast in his cabin , never once thinking of inspecting the town , being one of those englishmen who are wo nt to see foreign countries through the eyes of their domestics .",129

""" this statement came from mrs . charpentier 's lips with many gasps and pauses . at times she spoke so low that i could hardly catch the words . i made shorthand notes of all that she said , however , so that there should be no possibility of a mistake . """,33
kitty drew a little note from her bosom .,4
"how different it was with material things ! where had they passed to ? where was the great crocus - coloured robe , on which the gods fought against the giants , that had been worked by brown girls for the pleasure of athena ? where the huge velarium that nero had stretched across the colosseum at rome , that titan sail of purple on which was represented the starry sky , and apollo driving a chariot drawn by white , gilt - reined steeds ? he longed to see the curious table - napkins wrought for the priest of the sun , on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast ; the mortuary cloth of king chilperic , with its three hundred golden bees ; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the bishop of pontus and were figured with "" lions , panthers , bears , dogs , forests , rocks , hunters -- all , in fact , that a painter can copy from nature "" ; and the coat that charles of orleans once wore , on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning "" madame , je suis tout joyeux , "" the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread , and each note , of square shape in those days , formed with four pearls .",225
"the platform emerged only eighty centimeters above the waves . the nautilus 's bow and stern boasted that spindle - shaped outline that had caused the ship to be compared appropriately to a long cigar . i noted the slight overlap of its sheet - iron plates , which resembled the scales covering the bodies of our big land reptiles . so i had a perfectly natural explanation for why , despite the best spyglasses , this boat had always been mistaken for a marine animal .",37
""" nothing is easier , "" said i , putting down figures in my note book . "" nine times a hundred and twenty - five feet gives a depth of eleven hundred and twenty - five feet . """,14

""" surely , but as we move ahead to the far end of this gulf , you 'll note its odd appearance . i recall seeing the bay of el tur completely red , like a lake of blood . """,18
""" yes , my gallant ned , "" conseil replied . "" and note well , even when one has grasped all this , one still knows next to nothing , because these families are subdivided into genera , subgenera , species , varieties-- """,13
the subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer ; but i suppose the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy warbled with the lisp of childhood ; and in very bad taste that point was : at least i thought so .,22
"i remark that professor liedenbrock has a tendency to relapse into an impatient mood , and i make a note of it in my log . all my danger and sufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him ; but now that i am well his nature has resumed its sway . and yet , what cause was there for anger ? is not the voyage prospering as favourably as possible under the circumstances ? is not the raft spinning along with marvellous speed ?",19
"on this note i was about to withdraw ; but captain nemo detained me and invited me to take a seat next to him . he questioned me with interest on our excursions ashore and on our hunting , but seemed not to understand the canadian 's passionate craving for red meat . then our conversation skimmed various subjects , and without being more forthcoming , captain nemo proved more affable .",2
"as soon as i was dressed , i made my way to the main lounge . it was deserted . i dove into studying the conchological treasures amassed inside the glass cases . i also investigated the huge plant albums that were filled with the rarest marine herbs , which , although they were pressed and dried , still kept their wonderful colors . among these valuable water plants , i noted various seaweed : some cladostephus verticillatus , peacock 's tails , fig - leafed caulerpa , grain - bearing beauty bushes , delicate rosetangle tinted scarlet , sea colander arranged into fan shapes , mermaid 's cups that looked like the caps of squat mushrooms and for years had been classified among the zoophytes ; in short , a complete series of algae .",71
"but after all , as conseil noted , we enjoyed complete freedom , we were daintily and abundantly fed . our host had kept to the terms of his agreement . we could n't complain , and moreover the very uniqueness of our situation had such generous rewards in store for us , we had no grounds for criticism .",6
""" i am afraid , my dear watson , that most of your conclusions were erroneous . when i said that you stimulated me i meant , to be frank , that in noting your fallacies i was occasionally guided towards the truth . not that you are entirely wrong in this instance . the man is certainly a country practitioner . and he walks a good deal . """,33
"i was pursuing the policy that we had seen the last of him , when on november 16 , while reentering my stateroom with ned and conseil , i found a note addressed to me on the table .",31
the note was worded as follows :,1
""" well , i sometimes think we are too quiet ; but we run a chance of being busy enough now : for a little while at least , "" said mrs . fairfax , still holding the note before her spectacles .",38
"i was a mile from thornfield , in a lane noted for wild roses in summer , for nuts and blackberries in autumn , and even now possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws , but whose best winter delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose .",10
"they were almost famished ; fortunately , the larder was not far off , and neb was noted for being an expeditious cook .",17
"near two o'clock i was busy organizing my notes in the lounge , when the captain opened the door and appeared . i bowed to him . he gave me an almost imperceptible bow in return , without saying a word to me . i resumed my work , hoping he might give me some explanation of the previous afternoon 's events . he did nothing of the sort . i stared at him . his face looked exhausted ; his reddened eyes had n't been refreshed by sleep ; his facial features expressed profound sadness , real chagrin . he walked up and down , sat and stood , picked up a book at random , discarded it immediately , consulted his instruments without taking his customary notes , and seemed unable to rest easy for an instant .",128
"i assented gladly , and we all descended together . our prisoner made no attempt at escape , but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his , and we followed him . lestrade mounted the box , whipped up the horse , and brought us in a very short time to our destination . we were ushered into a small chamber where a police inspector noted down our prisoner 's name and the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged . the official was a white - faced unemotional man , who went through his duties in a dull mechanical way . "" the prisoner will be put before the magistrates in the course of the week , "" he said ; "" in the mean time , mr . jefferson hope , have you anything that you wish to say ? i must warn you that your words will be taken down , and may be used against you . """,67
"with these words , jefferson hope leaned back in his chair and began the following remarkable statement . he spoke in a calm and methodical manner , as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough . i can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account , for i have had access to lestrade 's note - book , in which the prisoner 's words were taken down exactly as they were uttered .",57
"among others i noted that sand goby mentioned by aristotle and commonly known by the name sea loach , which is encountered exclusively in the salty waters next to the nile delta . near them some semiphosphorescent red porgy rolled by , a variety of gilthead that the egyptians ranked among their sacred animals , lauding them in religious ceremonies when their arrival in the river 's waters announced the fertile flood season . i also noticed some wrasse known as the tapiro , three decimeters long , bony fish with transparent scales whose bluish gray color is mixed with red spots ; they 're enthusiastic eaters of marine vegetables , which gives them an exquisite flavor ; hence these tapiro were much in demand by the epicures of ancient rome , and their entrails were dressed with brains of peacock , tongue of flamingo , and testes of moray to make that divine platter that so enraptured the roman emperor vitellius .",3
"our return journey began . captain nemo resumed the lead in our little band , always heading forward without hesitation . i noted that we did n't follow the same path in returning to the nautilus . this new route , very steep and hence very arduous , quickly took us close to the surface of the sea . but this return to the upper strata was n't so sudden that decompression took place too quickly , which could have led to serious organic disorders and given us those internal injuries so fatal to divers . with great promptness , the light reappeared and grew stronger ; and the refraction of the sun , already low on the horizon , again ringed the edges of various objects with the entire color spectrum .",22
"a note was fastened to his neck , and cyrus harding read these words , traced in neb 's large writing:--""no pirates in the neighborhood of granite house .",1
"sheer chance had placed me in the presence of the most valuable specimens of this zoophyte . this coral was the equal of those fished up from the mediterranean off the barbary coast or the shores of france and italy . with its bright colors , it lived up to those poetic names of blood flower and blood foam that the industry confers on its finest exhibits . coral sells for as much as 500 francs per kilogram , and in this locality the liquid strata hid enough to make the fortunes of a whole host of coral fishermen . this valuable substance often merges with other polyparies , forming compact , hopelessly tangled units known as "" macciota , "" and i noted some wonderful pink samples of this coral .",123
"i meticulously noted these different depths , obtaining the underwater profile of this upside - down mountain chain that stretched beneath the sea .",2
after breakfast the professor gave a few hours to the arrangement of his daily notes .,14
"the sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass , or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine , seemed to make the stillness more oppressive . the dim roar of london was like the bourdon note of a distant organ .",47
"d’artagnan was at the height of joy ; he had realized the plan he had imagined beforehand , whose picturing had produced the smiles we noted upon his face .",25
d’artagnan was amazed to note by what fragile and unknown threads the destinies of nations and the lives of men are suspended .,4
""" but , "" as the engineer justly observed , "" that could not take the place of a regular bridge ! "" so , the construction of a regular bridge was noted in the list of future works .",32
"among other fowl i noted some sheathbills from the wading - bird family , the size of pigeons , white in color , the beak short and conical , the eyes framed by red circles . conseil laid in a supply of them , because when they 're properly cooked , these winged creatures make a pleasant dish . in the air there passed sooty albatross with four - meter wingspans , birds aptly dubbed "" vultures of the ocean , "" also gigantic petrels including several with arching wings , enthusiastic eaters of seal that are known as quebrantahuesos , and cape pigeons , a sort of small duck , the tops of their bodies black and white -- in short , a whole series of petrels , some whitish with wings trimmed in brown , others blue and exclusive to these antarctic seas , the former "" so oily , "" i told conseil , "" that inhabitants of the faroe islands simply fit the bird with a wick , then light it up . """,4
""" here is his letter , "" said d’artagnan , and he presented the note to his comrades .",14
"for his part , conseil thought he spotted a turtle six feet wide and adorned with three protruding ridges that ran lengthwise . i was sorry to miss this reptile , because from conseil 's description , i believe i recognized the leatherback turtle , a pretty rare species . for my part , i noted only some loggerhead turtles with long carapaces .",55
"the king turned pale , and shut his note - book hastily . ' consider your verdict , ' he said to the jury , in a low , trembling voice .",8
