"at five in the morning i was awoke by the neighing and pawing of four horses under my window . i dressed hastily and came down into the street . hans was finishing our packing , almost as it were without moving a limb ; and yet he did his work cleverly . my uncle made more noise than execution , and the guide seemed to pay very little attention to his energetic directions .",21
"even the common uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost their interest in the play . they got restless , and began to talk loudly and to whistle . the jew manager , who was standing at the back of the dress - circle , stamped and swore with rage . the only person unmoved was the girl herself .",42
"immediately two waiters and two servant - girls , dressed in cloth of gold , and their hair braided with ribbons of tissue , accosted the strangers and invited them to sit down to the ordinary . their dinner consisted of four dishes of different soups , each garnished with two young paroquets , a large dish of bouille that weighed two hundred weight , two roasted monkeys of a delicious flavor , three hundred hummingbirds in one dish , and six hundred flybirds in another ; some excellent ragouts , delicate tarts , and the whole served up in dishes of rock - crystal . several sorts of liquors , extracted from the sugarcane , were handed about by the servants who attended .",9
"that little stout man , short and elderly , that sort of lackey , dressed in dark clothes , treated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed the escort , was bonacieux himself .",14
"from every enjoyment i was , of course , excluded : my share of the gaiety consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of eliza and georgiana , and seeing them descend to the drawing - room , dressed out in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes , with hair elaborately ringletted ; and afterwards , in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played below , to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman , to the jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed , to the broken hum of conversation as the drawing - room door opened and closed .",37
"mrs . fairfax was summoned to give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls , dresses , draperies of any kind ; and certain wardrobes of the third storey were ransacked , and their contents , in the shape of brocaded and hooped petticoats , satin sacques , black modes , lace lappets , & c. , were brought down in armfuls by the abigails ; then a selection was made , and such things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir within the drawing - room .",17
"georgiana sat on a high stool , dressing her hair at the glass , and interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers , of which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic .",7
"in addition to the sword , there was a portrait representing a nobleman of the time of henry iii , dressed with the greatest elegance , and who wore the order of the holy ghost ; and this portrait had certain resemblances of lines with athos , certain family likenesses which indicated that this great noble , a knight of the order of the king , was his ancestor .",20

"porthos knocked with his hand . a tall , pale clerk , his face shaded by a forest of virgin hair , opened the door , and bowed with the air of a man forced at once to respect in another lofty stature , which indicated strength , the military dress , which indicated rank , and a ruddy countenance , which indicated familiarity with good living .",50

"around the nautilus for a half - mile radius , the waters seemed saturated with electric light . the sandy bottom was clear and bright . dressed in diving suits , crewmen were busy clearing away half - rotted barrels and disemboweled trunks in the midst of the dingy hulks of ships . out of these trunks and kegs spilled ingots of gold and silver , cascades of jewels , pieces of eight . the sand was heaped with them . then , laden with these valuable spoils , the men returned to the nautilus , dropped off their burdens inside , and went to resume this inexhaustible fishing for silver and gold .",26

"i took one last look at the natural wonders and artistic treasures amassed in the museum , this unrivaled collection doomed to perish someday in the depths of the seas , together with its curator . i wanted to establish one supreme impression in my mind . i stayed there an hour , basking in the aura of the ceiling lights , passing in review the treasures shining in their glass cases . then i returned to my stateroom . there i dressed in sturdy seafaring clothes . i gathered my notes and packed them tenderly about my person . my heart was pounding mightily . i could n't curb its pulsations . my anxiety and agitation would certainly have given me away if captain nemo had seen me .",82

"they found him up , less pale than when d’artagnan left him after his first visit , and seated at a table on which , though he was alone , was spread enough for four persons . this dinner consisted of meats nicely dressed , choice wines , and superb fruit .",43

the king came out first from his room . he was in a most elegant hunting costume ; and monsieur and the other nobles were dressed like him .,25
"he went to his room and dressed . there was a wild recklessness of gaiety in his manner as he sat at table , but now and then a thrill of terror ran through him when he remembered that , pressed against the window of the conservatory , like a white handkerchief , he had seen the face of james vane watching him .",6
"in the middle of the choir the body of the victim , clothed in her novitiate dress , was exposed .",16
"then came a new development . i had drawn you as paris in dainty armour , and as adonis with huntsman 's cloak and polished boar- spear . crowned with heavy lotus - blossoms you had sat on the prow of adrian 's barge , gazing across the green turbid nile . you had leaned over the still pool of some greek woodland and seen in the water 's silent silver the marvel of your own face . and it had all been what art should be -- unconscious , ideal , and remote . one day , a fatal day i sometimes think , i determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are , not in the costume of dead ages , but in your own dress and in your own time . whether it was the realism of the method , or the mere wonder of your own personality , thus directly presented to me without mist or veil , i can not tell . but i know that as i worked at it , every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret .",131
"the next day , february 20 , i overslept . i was so exhausted from the night before , i did n't get up until eleven o'clock . i dressed quickly . i hurried to find out the nautilus 's heading . the instruments indicated that it was running southward at a speed of twenty miles per hour and a depth of 100 meters .",29

milady was dressing herself all the time .,2
"she entered , transformed as her guardian had predicted . a dress of rose - coloured satin , very short , and as full in the skirt as it could be gathered , replaced the brown frock she had previously worn ; a wreath of rosebuds circled her forehead ; her feet were dressed in silk stockings and small white satin sandals .",53
"five o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of january , when bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and nearly dressed .",29

"passepartout was not the man to let an idea go begging , and directed his steps towards the docks . but , as he approached them , his project , which at first had seemed so simple , began to grow more and more formidable to his mind . what need would they have of a cook or servant on an american steamer , and what confidence would they put in him , dressed as he was ? what references could he give ?",73

"in consequence thereof they had seized on a biscayan for marrying his godmother , and on two portuguese for taking out the bacon of a larded pullet they were eating ; after dinner they came and secured dr . pangloss , and his pupil candide , the one for speaking his mind , and the other for seeming to approve what he had said . they were conducted to separate apartments , extremely cool , where they were never incommoded with the sun . eight days afterwards they were each dressed in a sanbenito , and their heads were adorned with paper mitres . the mitre and sanbenito worn by candide were painted with flames reversed and with devils that had neither tails nor claws ; but dr . pangloss 's devils had both tails and claws , and his flames were upright .",90

"the long noses form a peculiar company , under the direct patronage of the god tingou . attired after the fashion of the middle ages , they bore upon their shoulders a splendid pair of wings ; but what especially distinguished them was the long noses which were fastened to their faces , and the uses which they made of them . these noses were made of bamboo , and were five , six , and even ten feet long , some straight , others curved , some ribboned , and some having imitation warts upon them . it was upon these appendages , fixed tightly on their real noses , that they performed their gymnastic exercises . a dozen of these sectaries of tingou lay flat upon their backs , while others , dressed to represent lightning - rods , came and frolicked on their noses , jumping from one to another , and performing the most skilful leapings and somersaults .",134
"as soon as they were seated , two very pretty girls , neatly dressed , brought in chocolate , which was extremely well prepared .",13
"there once more , through the panels opening into these caribbean waters ten meters below the surface of the waves , i found so many fascinating exhibits to describe in my daily notes ! among other zoophytes there were portuguese men - of - war known by the name physalia pelagica , like big , oblong bladders with a pearly sheen , spreading their membranes to the wind , letting their blue tentacles drift like silken threads ; to the eye delightful jellyfish , to the touch actual nettles that ooze a corrosive liquid . among the articulates there were annelid worms one and a half meters long , furnished with a pink proboscis , equipped with 1,700 organs of locomotion , snaking through the waters , and as they went , throwing off every gleam in the solar spectrum . from the fish branch there were manta rays , enormous cartilaginous fish ten feet long and weighing 600 pounds , their pectoral fin triangular , their midback slightly arched , their eyes attached to the edges of the face at the front of the head ; they floated like wreckage from a ship , sometimes fastening onto our windows like opaque shutters . there were american triggerfish for which nature has ground only black and white pigments , feather - shaped gobies that were long and plump with yellow fins and jutting jaws , sixteen - decimeter mackerel with short , sharp teeth , covered with small scales , and related to the albacore species . next came swarms of red mullet corseted in gold stripes from head to tail , their shining fins all aquiver , genuine masterpieces of jewelry , formerly sacred to the goddess diana , much in demand by rich romans , and about which the old saying goes : "" he who catches them does n't eat them ! "" finally , adorned with emerald ribbons and dressed in velvet and silk , golden angelfish passed before our eyes like courtiers in the paintings of veronese ; spurred gilthead stole by with their swift thoracic fins ; thread herring fifteen inches long were wrapped in their phosphorescent glimmers ; gray mullet thrashed the sea with their big fleshy tails ; red salmon seemed to mow the waves with their slicing pectorals ; and silver moonfish , worthy of their name , rose on the horizon of the waters like the whitish reflections of many moons .",323

"soon i had put on my clothes , which were woven from strands of seashell tissue . more than once their composition provoked comments from conseil . i informed him that they were made from the smooth , silken filaments with which the fan mussel , a type of seashell quite abundant along mediterranean beaches , attaches itself to rocks . in olden times , fine fabrics , stockings , and gloves were made from such filaments , because they were both very soft and very warm . so the nautilus 's crew could dress themselves at little cost , without needing a thing from cotton growers , sheep , or silkworms on shore .",94
"as soon as i was dressed , i made my way to the main lounge . it was deserted . i dove into studying the conchological treasures amassed inside the glass cases . i also investigated the huge plant albums that were filled with the rarest marine herbs , which , although they were pressed and dried , still kept their wonderful colors . among these valuable water plants , i noted various seaweed : some cladostephus verticillatus , peacock 's tails , fig - leafed caulerpa , grain - bearing beauty bushes , delicate rosetangle tinted scarlet , sea colander arranged into fan shapes , mermaid 's cups that looked like the caps of squat mushrooms and for years had been classified among the zoophytes ; in short , a complete series of algae .",5

"while lord henry sat dreaming on these things , a knock came to the door , and his valet entered and reminded him it was time to dress for dinner . he got up and looked out into the street . the sunset had smitten into scarlet gold the upper windows of the houses opposite . the panes glowed like plates of heated metal . the sky above was like a faded rose . he thought of his friend 's young fiery - coloured life and wondered how it was all going to end .",27

"the temperature was fairly low . exposed to the outside air , the thermometer marked -2 degrees to -3 degrees centigrade . but we were warmly dressed in furs , for which seals and aquatic bears had paid the price . evenly heated by all its electric equipment , the nautilus 's interior defied the most intense cold . moreover , to find a bearable temperature , the ship had only to sink just a few meters beneath the waves .",26
"this did not take long . at the end of five minutes they perceived the carriage drawn up by the roadside ; a cavalier , richly dressed , was close to the door .",26
