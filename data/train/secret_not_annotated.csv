"then i began to wonder if this eccentric individual was even on board . since that night when the skiff had left the nautilus on some mysterious mission , my ideas about him had subtly changed . in spite of everything , i thought that captain nemo must have kept up some type of relationship with the shore . did he himself never leave the nautilus ? whole weeks had often gone by without my encountering him . what was he doing all the while ? during all those times i 'd thought he was convalescing in the grip of some misanthropic fit , was he instead far away from the ship , involved in some secret activity whose nature still eluded me ?",116

"now then , although the latter hypothesis was completely admissible , it could n't stand up to inquiries conducted in both the new world and the old . that a private individual had such a mechanism at his disposal was less than probable . where and when had he built it , and how could he have built it in secret ?",60
"their anxiety about their outfits had all disappeared , and each countenance only preserved the expression of its own secret disquiet -- for behind all present happiness is concealed a fear for the future .",19
"for nearly ten minutes he stood there , motionless , with parted lips and eyes strangely bright . he was dimly conscious that entirely fresh influences were at work within him . yet they seemed to him to have come really from himself . the few words that basil 's friend had said to him -- words spoken by chance , no doubt , and with wilful paradox in them-- had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before , but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses .",73
""" yes , "" continued lord henry , "" that is one of the great secrets of life-- to cure the soul by means of the senses , and the senses by means of the soul . you are a wonderful creation . you know more than you think you know , just as you know less than you want to know . """,15
"he felt that the time had really come for making his choice . or had his choice already been made ? yes , life had decided that for him -- life , and his own infinite curiosity about life . eternal youth , infinite passion , pleasures subtle and secret , wild joys and wilder sins -- he was to have all these things . the portrait was to bear the burden of his shame : that was all .",49
"for there would be a real pleasure in watching it . he would be able to follow his mind into its secret places . this portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors . as it had revealed to him his own body , so it would reveal to him his own soul . and when winter came upon it , he would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of summer . when the blood crept from its face , and left behind a pallid mask of chalk with leaden eyes , he would keep the glamour of boyhood . not one blossom of his loveliness would ever fade . not one pulse of his life would ever weaken . like the gods of the greeks , he would be strong , and fleet , and joyous . what did it matter what happened to the coloured image on the canvas ? he would be safe . that was everything .",21

"as i mused in this way , trying to establish in my memory every detail of this impressive landscape , captain nemo was leaning his elbows on a moss - covered monument , motionless as if petrified in some mute trance . was he dreaming of those lost generations , asking them for the secret of human destiny ? was it here that this strange man came to revive himself , basking in historical memories , reliving that bygone life , he who had no desire for our modern one ? i would have given anything to know his thoughts , to share them , understand them !",54
"then came a new development . i had drawn you as paris in dainty armour , and as adonis with huntsman 's cloak and polished boar- spear . crowned with heavy lotus - blossoms you had sat on the prow of adrian 's barge , gazing across the green turbid nile . you had leaned over the still pool of some greek woodland and seen in the water 's silent silver the marvel of your own face . and it had all been what art should be -- unconscious , ideal , and remote . one day , a fatal day i sometimes think , i determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are , not in the costume of dead ages , but in your own dress and in your own time . whether it was the realism of the method , or the mere wonder of your own personality , thus directly presented to me without mist or veil , i can not tell . but i know that as i worked at it , every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret .",193

"as he left the room , dorian gray smiled to himself . poor basil ! how little he knew of the true reason ! and how strange it was that , instead of having been forced to reveal his own secret , he had succeeded , almost by chance , in wresting a secret from his friend ! how much that strange confession explained to him ! the painter 's absurd fits of jealousy , his wild devotion , his extravagant panegyrics , his curious reticences-- he understood them all now , and he felt sorry . there seemed to him to be something tragic in a friendship so coloured by romance .",53

"so ned land had good reason to worry . in these wide seas empty of islands , it was no longer feasible to jump ship . nor did we have any way to counter captain nemo 's whims . we had no choice but to acquiesce ; but if we could n't attain our end through force or cunning , i liked to think we might achieve it through persuasion . once this voyage was over , might not captain nemo consent to set us free in return for our promise never to reveal his existence ? our word of honor , which we sincerely would have kept . however , this delicate question would have to be negotiated with the captain . but how would he receive our demands for freedom ? at the very outset and in no uncertain terms , had n't he declared that the secret of his life required that we be permanently imprisoned on board the nautilus ? would n't he see my four - month silence as a tacit acceptance of this situation ? would my returning to this subject arouse suspicions that could jeopardize our escape plans , if we had promising circumstances for trying again later on ? i weighed all these considerations , turned them over in my mind , submitted them to conseil , but he was as baffled as i was . in short , although i 'm not easily discouraged , i realized that my chances of ever seeing my fellow men again were shrinking by the day , especially at a time when captain nemo was recklessly racing toward the south atlantic !",149

"for a minute i stood there with the paper in my hands thinking out the meaning of this curt message . it was i , then , and not sir henry , who was being dogged by this secret man . he had not followed me himself , but he had set an agent -- the boy , perhaps -- upon my track , and this was his report . possibly i had taken no step since i had been upon the moor which had not been observed and reported . always there was this feeling of an unseen force , a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and delicacy , holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme moment that one realized that one was indeed entangled in its meshes .",38
