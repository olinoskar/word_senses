"my first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this moor , to get something for our subsistence on board ; for i told him we must not presume to eat of our patron ’s bread . he said that was true ; so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit , and three jars of fresh water , into the boat . i knew where my patron ’s case of bottles stood , which it was evident , by the make , were taken out of some english prize , and i conveyed them into the boat while the moor was on shore , as if they had been there before for our master . i conveyed also a great lump of beeswax into the boat , which weighed about half a hundred - weight , with a parcel of twine or thread , a hatchet , a saw , and a hammer , all of which were of great use to us afterwards , especially the wax , to make candles . another trick i tried upon him , which he innocently came into also : his name was ismael , which they call muley , or moely ; so i called to him—“moely , ” said i , “ our patron ’s guns are on board the boat ; can you not get a little powder and shot ? it may be we may kill some alcamies ( a fowl like our curlews ) for ourselves , for i know he keeps the gunner ’s stores in the ship . ” “ yes , ” says he , “ i ’ll bring some ; ” and accordingly he brought a great leather pouch , which held a pound and a half of powder , or rather more ; and another with shot , that had five or six pounds , with some bullets , and put all into the boat . at the same time i had found some powder of my master ’s in the great cabin , with which i filled one of the large bottles in the case , which was almost empty , pouring what was in it into another ; and thus furnished with everything needful , we sailed out of the port to fish . the castle , which is at the entrance of the port , knew who we were , and took no notice of us ; and we were not above a mile out of the port before we hauled in our sail and set us down to fish . the wind blew from the n.n.e . , which was contrary to my desire , for had it blown southerly i had been sure to have made the coast of spain , and at least reached to the bay of cadiz ; but my resolutions were , blow which way it would , i would be gone from that horrid place where i was , and leave the rest to fate .",470

"but , alas ! for me to do wrong that never did right , was no great wonder . i hail no remedy but to go on : i had got into an employment quite remote to my genius , and directly contrary to the life i delighted in , and for which i forsook my father ’s house , and broke through all his good advice . nay , i was coming into the very middle station , or upper degree of low life , which my father advised me to before , and which , if i resolved to go on with , i might as well have stayed at home , and never have fatigued myself in the world as i had done ; and i used often to say to myself , i could have done this as well in england , among my friends , as have gone five thousand miles off to do it among strangers and savages , in a wilderness , and at such a distance as never to hear from any part of the world that had the least knowledge of me .",187

"while my jealousy of him lasted , you may be sure i was every day pumping him to see if he would discover any of the new thoughts which i suspected were in him ; but i found everything he said was so honest and so innocent , that i could find nothing to nourish my suspicion ; and in spite of all my uneasiness , he made me at last entirely his own again ; nor did he in the least perceive that i was uneasy , and therefore i could not suspect him of deceit .",81
"upon the whole , as i found by all his discourse a settled affection to me , and that nothing could part him from me , so i found all the foundation of his desire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent affection to the people , and his hopes of my doing them good ; a thing which , as i had no notion of myself , so i had not the least thought or intention , or desire of undertaking it . but still i found a strong inclination to attempting my escape , founded on the supposition gathered from the discourse , that there were seventeen bearded men there ; and therefore , without any more delay , i went to work with friday to find out a great tree proper to fell , and make a large periagua , or canoe , to undertake the voyage . there were trees enough in the island to have built a little fleet , not of periaguas or canoes , but even of good , large vessels ; but the main thing i looked at was , to get one so near the water that we might launch it when it was made , to avoid the mistake i committed at first .",77
