""" the devil 's agents may be of flesh and blood , may they not ? there are two questions waiting for us at the outset . the one is whether any crime has been committed at all ; the second is , what is the crime and how was it committed ? of course , if dr . mortimer 's surmise should be correct , and we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws of nature , there is an end of our investigation . but we are bound to exhaust all other hypotheses before falling back upon this one . i think we 'll shut that window again , if you do n't mind . it is a singular thing , but i find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of thought . i have not pushed it to the length of getting into a box to think , but that is the logical outcome of my convictions . have you turned the case over in your mind ?
