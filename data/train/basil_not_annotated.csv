"a quarter of an hour afterwards , amidst an extraordinary turmoil of applause , sibyl vane stepped on to the stage . yes , she was certainly lovely to look at-- one of the loveliest creatures , lord henry thought , that he had ever seen . there was something of the fawn in her shy grace and startled eyes . a faint blush , like the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver , came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded enthusiastic house . she stepped back a few paces and her lips seemed to tremble . basil hallward leaped to his feet and began to applaud . motionless , and as one in a dream , sat dorian gray , gazing at her . lord henry peered through his glasses , murmuring , "" charming ! charming ! """,103
""" they are both simply forms of imitation , "" remarked lord henry . "" but do let us go . dorian , you must not stay here any longer . it is not good for one 's morals to see bad acting . besides , i do n't suppose you will want your wife to act , so what does it matter if she plays juliet like a wooden doll ? she is very lovely , and if she knows as little about life as she does about acting , she will be a delightful experience . there are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating-- people who know absolutely everything , and people who know absolutely nothing . good heavens , my dear boy , do n't look so tragic ! the secret of remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming . come to the club with basil and myself . we will smoke cigarettes and drink to the beauty of sibyl vane . she is beautiful . what more can you want ? """,155
""" i think you are wrong , basil , but i wo n't argue with you . it is only the intellectually lost who ever argue . tell me , is dorian gray very fond of you ? """,7
""" days in summer , basil , are apt to linger , "" murmured lord henry . "" perhaps you will tire sooner than he will . it is a sad thing to think of , but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty . that accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over - educate ourselves . in the wild struggle for existence , we want to have something that endures , and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts , in the silly hope of keeping our place . the thoroughly well - informed man -- that is the modern ideal . and the mind of the thoroughly well - informed man is a dreadful thing . it is like a bric - a - brac shop , all monsters and dust , with everything priced above its proper value .",5
"there was a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy , and the blue cloud - shadows chased themselves across the grass like swallows . how pleasant it was in the garden ! and how delightful other people 's emotions were!-- much more delightful than their ideas , it seemed to him . one 's own soul , and the passions of one 's friends -- those were the fascinating things in life . he pictured to himself with silent amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long with basil hallward .",98
"yet it was watching him , with its beautiful marred face and its cruel smile . its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight . its blue eyes met his own . a sense of infinite pity , not for himself , but for the painted image of himself , came over him . it had altered already , and would alter more . its gold would wither into grey . its red and white roses would die . for every sin that he committed , a stain would fleck and wreck its fairness . but he would not sin . the picture , changed or unchanged , would be to him the visible emblem of conscience . he would resist temptation . he would not see lord henry any more -- would not , at any rate , listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in basil hallward 's garden had first stirred within him the passion for impossible things . he would go back to sibyl vane , make her amends , marry her , try to love her again . yes , it was his duty to do so . she must have suffered more than he had . poor child ! he had been selfish and cruel to her . the fascination that she had exercised over him would return . they would be happy together . his life with her would be beautiful and pure .",147
"but he felt afraid of him , and ashamed of being afraid . why had it been left for a stranger to reveal him to himself ? he had known basil hallward for months , but the friendship between them had never altered him . suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to have disclosed to him life 's mystery . and , yet , what was there to be afraid of ? he was not a schoolboy or a girl . it was absurd to be frightened .",30
""" you would hardly care for such an arrangement , basil , "" cried lord henry , laughing . "" it would be rather hard lines on your work . """,10
"dorian gray turned and looked at him . "" i believe you would , basil . you like your art better than your friends . i am no more to you than a green bronze figure . hardly as much , i dare say . """,14
""" stop , basil ! i wo n't hear it ! "" cried dorian , leaping to his feet . "" you must not tell me about things . what is done is done . what is past is past . """,3
"the lad flushed up and , going to the window , looked out for a few moments on the green , flickering , sun - lashed garden . "" i owe a great deal to harry , basil , "" he said at last , "" more than i owe to you . you only taught me to be vain . """,37
""" appreciate it ? i am in love with it , basil . it is part of myself . i feel that . """,11
""" i adore simple pleasures , "" said lord henry . "" they are the last refuge of the complex . but i do n't like scenes , except on the stage . what absurd fellows you are , both of you ! i wonder who it was defined man as a rational animal . it was the most premature definition ever given . man is many things , but he is not rational . i am glad he is not , after all-- though i wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture . you had much better let me have it , basil . this silly boy does n't really want it , and i really do . """,105
""" if you let any one have it but me , basil , i shall never forgive you ! "" cried dorian gray ; "" and i do n't allow people to call me a silly boy . """,11
""" i can never sit to you again , basil . it is impossible ! "" he exclaimed , starting back .",9
""" my servant has nothing to do with it , basil . you do n't imagine i let him arrange my room for me ? he settles my flowers for me sometimes-- that is all . no ; i did it myself . the light was too strong on the portrait . """,10
""" if you try to look at it , basil , on my word of honour i will never speak to you again as long as i live . i am quite serious . i do n't offer any explanation , and you are not to ask for any . but , remember , if you touch this screen , everything is over between us . """,9
""" basil ! "" cried the lad , clutching the arms of his chair with trembling hands and gazing at him with wild startled eyes .",1
""" no ; there was nothing else to see . why do you ask ? but you must n't talk about worship . it is foolish . you and i are friends , basil , and we must always remain so . """,33
""" oh , harry ! "" cried the lad , with a ripple of laughter . "" harry spends his days in saying what is incredible and his evenings in doing what is improbable . just the sort of life i would like to lead . but still i do n't think i would go to harry if i were in trouble . i would sooner go to you , basil . """,70
"he shuddered , and for a moment he regretted that he had not told basil the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away . basil would have helped him to resist lord henry 's influence , and the still more poisonous influences that came from his own temperament . the love that he bore him -- for it was really love-- had nothing in it that was not noble and intellectual . it was not that mere physical admiration of beauty that is born of the senses and that dies when the senses tire . it was such love as michelangelo had known , and montaigne , and winckelmann , and shakespeare himself . yes , basil could have saved him . but it was too late now . the past could always be annihilated . regret , denial , or forgetfulness could do that . but the future was inevitable . there were passions in him that would find their terrible outlet , dreams that would make the shadow of their evil real .",14

"but there was no other place in the house so secure from prying eyes as this . he had the key , and no one else could enter it . beneath its purple pall , the face painted on the canvas could grow bestial , sodden , and unclean . what did it matter ? no one could see it . he himself would not see it . why should he watch the hideous corruption of his soul ? he kept his youth-- that was enough . and , besides , might not his nature grow finer , after all ? there was no reason that the future should be so full of shame . some love might come across his life , and purify him , and shield him from those sins that seemed to be already stirring in spirit and in flesh-- those curious unpictured sins whose very mystery lent them their subtlety and their charm . perhaps , some day , the cruel look would have passed away from the scarlet sensitive mouth , and he might show to the world basil hallward 's masterpiece .",184

""" what do you think has happened to basil ? "" asked dorian , holding up his burgundy against the light and wondering how it was that he could discuss the matter so calmly .",8
"dorian said nothing , but rose from the table , and passing into the next room , sat down to the piano and let his fingers stray across the white and black ivory of the keys . after the coffee had been brought in , he stopped , and looking over at lord henry , said , "" harry , did it ever occur to you that basil was murdered ? """,67
"lord henry yawned . "" basil was very popular , and always wore a waterbury watch . why should he have been murdered ? he was not clever enough to have enemies . of course , he had a wonderful genius for painting . but a man can paint like velasquez and yet be as dull as possible . basil was really rather dull . he only interested me once , and that was when he told me , years ago , that he had a wild adoration for you and that you were the dominant motive of his art . """,5
""" i was very fond of basil , "" said dorian with a note of sadness in his voice . "" but do n't people say that he was murdered ? """,6
""" so you think that it is only god who sees the soul , basil ? draw that curtain back , and you will see mine . """,14
"dorian gray turned slowly around and looked at him with tear - dimmed eyes . "" it is too late , basil , "" he faltered .",21
"he sat down and began to think . every year -- every month , almost-- men were strangled in england for what he had done . there had been a madness of murder in the air . some red star had come too close to the earth . . . . and yet , what evidence was there against him ? basil hallward had left the house at eleven . no one had seen him come in again . most of the servants were at selby royal . his valet had gone to bed .... paris ! yes . it was to paris that basil had gone , and by the midnight train , as he had intended . with his curious reserved habits , it would be months before any suspicions would be roused . months ! everything could be destroyed long before then .",104
"besides , herbert discovered towards the southwest point of the lagoon a natural warren , a slightly damp meadow , covered with willows and aromatic herbs which scented the air , such as thyme , basil , savory , all the sweet - scented species of the labiated plants , which the rabbits appeared to be particularly fond of .",35
"herbert gathered several shoots of the basil , rosemary , balm , betony , etc . , which possess different medicinal properties , some pectoral , astringent , febrifuge , others anti - spasmodic , or anti - rheumatic .",6
"i suppose you have heard the news , basil ? "" said lord henry that evening as hallward was shown into a little private room at the bristol where dinner had been laid for three .",8

""" quite serious , basil . i should be miserable if i thought i should ever be more serious than i am at the present moment . """,4
""" there is really not much to tell , "" cried dorian as they took their seats at the small round table . "" what happened was simply this . after i left you yesterday evening , harry , i dressed , had some dinner at that little italian restaurant in rupert street you introduced me to , and went down at eight o'clock to the theatre . sibyl was playing rosalind . of course , the scenery was dreadful and the orlando absurd . but sibyl ! you should have seen her ! when she came on in her boy 's clothes , she was perfectly wonderful . she wore a moss - coloured velvet jerkin with cinnamon sleeves , slim , brown , cross - gartered hose , a dainty little green cap with a hawk 's feather caught in a jewel , and a hooded cloak lined with dull red . she had never seemed to me more exquisite . she had all the delicate grace of that tanagra figurine that you have in your studio , basil . her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round a pale rose . as for her acting -- well , you shall see her to - night . she is simply a born artist .",180
"i sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled . i forgot that i was in london and in the nineteenth century . i was away with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen . after the performance was over , i went behind and spoke to her . as we were sitting together , suddenly there came into her eyes a look that i had never seen there before . my lips moved towards hers . we kissed each other . i ca n't describe to you what i felt at that moment . it seemed to me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of rose - coloured joy . she trembled all over and shook like a white narcissus . then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands . i feel that i should not tell you all this , but i ca n't help it . of course , our engagement is a dead secret . she has not even told her own mother . i do n't know what my guardians will say . lord radley is sure to be furious . i do n't care . i shall be of age in less than a year , and then i can do what i like . i have been right , basil , have n't i , to take my love out of poetry and to find my wife in shakespeare 's plays ? lips that shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear . i have had the arms of rosalind around me , and kissed juliet on the mouth .

""" too much of yourself in it ! upon my word , basil , i did n't know you were so vain ; and i really ca n't see any resemblance between you , with your rugged strong face and your coal - black hair , and this young adonis , who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose - leaves . why , my dear basil , he is a narcissus , and you-- well , of course you have an intellectual expression and all that . but beauty , real beauty , ends where an intellectual expression begins . intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration , and destroys the harmony of any face . the moment one sits down to think , one becomes all nose , or all forehead , or something horrid . look at the successful men in any of the learned professions . how perfectly hideous they are ! except , of course , in the church . but then in the church they do n't think . a bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen , and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful .",70
