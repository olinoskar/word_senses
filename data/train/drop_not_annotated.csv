"so captain dumont d'urville had put to sea in command of a vessel named after the astrolabe , and just two months after dillon had left vanikoro , dumont d'urville dropped anchor before hobart . there he heard about dillon 's findings , and he further learned that a certain james hobbs , chief officer on the union out of calcutta , had put to shore on an island located in latitude 8 degrees 18 ' south and longitude 156 degrees 30 ' east , and had noted the natives of those waterways making use of iron bars and red fabrics .",30

"meanwhile , fearing that dumont d'urville was n't abreast of dillon 's activities , the french government sent a sloop of war to vanikoro , the bayonnaise under commander legoarant de tromelin , who had been stationed on the american west coast . dropping anchor before vanikoro a few months after the new astrolabe 's departure , the bayonnaise did n't find any additional evidence but verified that the savages had n't disturbed the memorial honoring the count de la pérouse .",43
