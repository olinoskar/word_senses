""" me , i 'm out like a light ! "" ned land replied . my two companions lay down on the cabin 's carpeting and were soon deep in slumber . as for me , i gave in less readily to this intense need for sleep . too many thoughts had piled up in my mind , too many insoluble questions had arisen , too many images were keeping my eyelids open ! where were we ? what strange power was carrying us along ? i felt -- or at least i thought i did -- the submersible sinking toward the sea 's lower strata . intense nightmares besieged me . in these mysterious marine sanctuaries , i envisioned hosts of unknown animals , and this underwater boat seemed to be a blood relation of theirs : living , breathing , just as fearsome . . . ! then my mind grew calmer , my imagination melted into hazy drowsiness , and i soon fell into an uneasy slumber .",46
"i left the captain in the dying man 's cabin and i repaired to my stateroom , very moved by this scene . all day long i was aquiver with gruesome forebodings . that night i slept poorly , and between my fitful dreams , i thought i heard a distant moaning , like a funeral dirge . was it a prayer for the dead , murmured in that language i could n't understand ?",36
"do you think i ever sleep , then ?",5

"one of these , concerning which i have said little , is the escaped convict upon the moor . there is strong reason now to believe that he has got right away , which is a considerable relief to the lonely householders of this district . a fortnight has passed since his flight , during which he has not been seen and nothing has been heard of him . it is surely inconceivable that he could have held out upon the moor during all that time . of course , so far as his concealment goes there is no difficulty at all . any one of these stone huts would give him a hiding - place . but there is nothing to eat unless he were to catch and slaughter one of the moor sheep . we think , therefore , that he has gone , and the outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence .",150
"that night my sleep was fitful . hope and fear besieged me by turns . i got up several times . the nautilus continued groping . near three o'clock in the morning , i observed that we encountered the ice bank 's underbelly at a depth of only fifty meters . so only 150 feet separated us from the surface of the water . little by little the ice bank was turning into an ice field again . the mountains were changing back into plains .",3
"barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against the glass . his profile was half turned towards me , and his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the moor . for some minutes he stood watching intently . then he gave a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light . instantly i made my way back to my room , and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing once more upon their return journey . long afterwards when i had fallen into a light sleep i heard a key turn somewhere in a lock , but i could not tell whence the sound came . what it all means i can not guess , but there is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of . i do not trouble you with my theories , for you asked me to furnish you only with facts . i have had a long talk with sir henry this morning , and we have made a plan of campaign founded upon my observations of last night . i will not speak about it just now , but it should make my next report interesting reading .",101
"however , after traveling for two hours , fatigue overcame him , and he slept .",14
"in fact , the mystery of that last afternoon when we were locked in prison and put to sleep , the captain 's violent precaution of snatching from my grasp a spyglass poised to scour the horizon , and the fatal wound given that man during some unexplained collision suffered by the nautilus , all led me down a plain trail . no ! captain nemo was n't content simply to avoid humanity ! his fearsome submersible served not only his quest for freedom , but also , perhaps , it was used in lord - knows - what schemes of dreadful revenge .",18
