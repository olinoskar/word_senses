"phileas fogg was seated squarely in his armchair , his feet close together like those of a grenadier on parade , his hands resting on his knees , his body straight , his head erect ; he was steadily watching a complicated clock which indicated the hours , the minutes , the seconds , the days , the months , and the years . at exactly half - past eleven mr . fogg would , according to his daily habit , quit saville row , and repair to the reform .",58
"the thermometer marked -12 degrees centigrade , and a fresh breeze left a sharp nip in the air . ice floes were increasing over the open water . the sea was starting to congeal everywhere . numerous blackish patches were spreading over its surface , announcing the imminent formation of fresh ice . obviously this southernmost basin froze over during its six - month winter and became utterly inaccessible . what happened to the whales during this period ? no doubt they went beneath the ice bank to find more feasible seas . as for seals and walruses , they were accustomed to living in the harshest climates and stayed on in these icy waterways . these animals know by instinct how to gouge holes in the ice fields and keep them continually open ; they go to these holes to breathe . once the birds have migrated northward to escape the cold , these marine mammals remain as sole lords of the polar continent .",63
"during the first week of the month of august the weather became more moderate , and the atmosphere recovered the calm which it appeared to have lost forever .",6

"this tree is distinguished from other trees by a straight trunk forty feet high . to the naturalist 's eye , its gracefully rounded crown , formed of big multilobed leaves , was enough to denote the artocarpus that has been so successfully transplanted to the mascarene islands east of madagascar . from its mass of greenery , huge globular fruit stood out , a decimeter wide and furnished on the outside with creases that assumed a hexangular pattern . it 's a handy plant that nature gives to regions lacking in wheat ; without needing to be cultivated , it bears fruit eight months out of the year .",104
"this testimonial i accordingly received in about a month , forwarded a copy of it to mrs . fairfax , and got that lady 's reply , stating that she was satisfied , and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my assuming the post of governess in her house .",8
""" kelso 's grandson ! "" echoed the old gentleman . "" kelso 's grandson ! ... of course .... i knew his mother intimately . i believe i was at her christening . she was an extraordinarily beautiful girl , margaret devereux , and made all the men frantic by running away with a penniless young fellow-- a mere nobody , sir , a subaltern in a foot regiment , or something of that kind . certainly . i remember the whole thing as if it happened yesterday . the poor chap was killed in a duel at spa a few months after the marriage . there was an ugly story about it .",102

"so ned land had good reason to worry . in these wide seas empty of islands , it was no longer feasible to jump ship . nor did we have any way to counter captain nemo 's whims . we had no choice but to acquiesce ; but if we could n't attain our end through force or cunning , i liked to think we might achieve it through persuasion . once this voyage was over , might not captain nemo consent to set us free in return for our promise never to reveal his existence ? our word of honor , which we sincerely would have kept . however , this delicate question would have to be negotiated with the captain . but how would he receive our demands for freedom ? at the very outset and in no uncertain terms , had n't he declared that the secret of his life required that we be permanently imprisoned on board the nautilus ? would n't he see my four - month silence as a tacit acceptance of this situation ? would my returning to this subject arouse suspicions that could jeopardize our escape plans , if we had promising circumstances for trying again later on ? i weighed all these considerations , turned them over in my mind , submitted them to conseil , but he was as baffled as i was . in short , although i 'm not easily discouraged , i realized that my chances of ever seeing my fellow men again were shrinking by the day , especially at a time when captain nemo was recklessly racing toward the south atlantic !",171

"d’artagnan had run , sword in hand , through all the neighboring streets , but had found nobody resembling the man he sought for . then he came back to the point where , perhaps , he ought to have begun , and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had leaned ; but this proved useless -- for though he knocked ten or twelve times in succession , no one answered , and some of the neighbors , who put their noses out of their windows or were brought to their doors by the noise , had assured him that that house , all the openings of which were tightly closed , had not been inhabited for six months .",123

"after i had been there about ten or twelve days , it came into my thoughts that i should lose my reckoning of time for want of books , and pen and ink , and should even forget the sabbath days ; but to prevent this , i cut with my knife upon a large post , in capital letters — and making it into a great cross , i set it up on the shore where i first landed—“i came on shore here on the 30th september 1659 . ” upon the sides of this square post i cut every day a notch with my knife , and every seventh notch was as long again as the rest , and every first day of the month as long again as that long one ; and thus i kept my calendar , or weekly , monthly , and yearly reckoning of time .",126
