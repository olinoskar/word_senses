"“ well , xury , ” said i , “ we will both go and if the wild mans come , we will kill them , they shall eat neither of us . ” so i gave xury a piece of rusk bread to eat , and a dram out of our patron ’s case of bottles which i mentioned before ; and we hauled the boat in as near the shore as we thought was proper , and so waded on shore , carrying nothing but our arms and two jars for water .",74
"by the best of my calculation , that place where i now was must be that country which , lying between the emperor of morocco ’s dominions and the negroes , lies waste and uninhabited , except by wild beasts ; the negroes having abandoned it and gone farther south for fear of the moors , and the moors not thinking it worth inhabiting by reason of its barrenness ; and indeed , both forsaking it because of the prodigious number of tigers , lions , leopards , and other furious creatures which harbour there ; so that the moors use it for their hunting only , where they go like an army , two or three thousand men at a time ; and indeed for near a hundred miles together upon this coast we saw nothing but a waste , uninhabited country by day , and heard nothing but howlings and roaring of wild beasts by night .",60
"in journeying eastward he had gone towards the sun , and the days therefore diminished for him as many times four minutes as he crossed degrees in this direction . there are three hundred and sixty degrees on the circumference of the earth ; and these three hundred and sixty degrees , multiplied by four minutes , gives precisely twenty - four hours -- that is , the day unconsciously gained . in other words , while phileas fogg , going eastward , saw the sun pass the meridian eighty times , his friends in london only saw it pass the meridian seventy - nine times . this is why they awaited him at the reform club on saturday , and not sunday , as mr . fogg thought .",128
"once or twice in the daytime i thought i saw the pico of teneriffe , being the high top of the mountain teneriffe in the canaries , and had a great mind to venture out , in hopes of reaching thither ; but having tried twice , i was forced in again by contrary winds , the sea also going too high for my little vessel ; so , i resolved to pursue my first design , and keep along the shore .",7
"it is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor creatures at the noise and fire of my gun : some of them were even ready to die for fear , and fell down as dead with the very terror ; but when they saw the creature dead , and sunk in the water , and that i made signs to them to come to the shore , they took heart and came , and began to search for the creature . i found him by his blood staining the water ; and by the help of a rope , which i slung round him , and gave the negroes to haul , they dragged him on shore , and found that it was a most curious leopard , spotted , and fine to an admirable degree ; and the negroes held up their hands with admiration , to think what it was i had killed him with .",149
"in this dilemma , as i was very pensive , i stepped into the cabin and sat down , xury having the helm ; when , on a sudden , the boy cried out , “ master , master , a ship with a sail ! ” and the foolish boy was frighted out of his wits , thinking it must needs be some of his master ’s ships sent to pursue us , but i knew we were far enough out of their reach . i jumped out of the cabin , and immediately saw , not only the ship , but that it was a portuguese ship ; and , as i thought , was bound to the coast of guinea , for negroes . but , when i observed the course she steered , i was soon convinced they were bound some other way , and did not design to come any nearer to the shore ; upon which i stretched out to sea as much as i could , resolving to speak with them if possible .",114

"these reflections made me very sensible of the goodness of providence to me , and very thankful for my present condition , with all its hardships and misfortunes ; and this part also i can not but recommend to the reflection of those who are apt , in their misery , to say , “ is any affliction like mine ? ” let them consider how much worse the cases of some people are , and their case might have been , if providence had thought fit .",85
"in this government of my temper i remained near a year ; and lived a very sedate , retired life , as you may well suppose ; and my thoughts being very much composed as to my condition , and fully comforted in resigning myself to the dispositions of providence , i thought i lived really very happily in all things except that of society .",52
"besides this , i arrived at an unexpected perfection in my earthenware , and contrived well enough to make them with a wheel , which i found infinitely easier and better ; because i made things round and shaped , which before were filthy things indeed to look on . but i think i was never more vain of my own performance , or more joyful for anything i found out , than for my being able to make a tobacco - pipe ; and though it was a very ugly , clumsy thing when it was done , and only burned red , like other earthenware , yet as it was hard and firm , and would draw the smoke , i was exceedingly comforted with it , for i had been always used to smoke ; and there were pipes in the ship , but i forgot them at first , not thinking there was tobacco in the island ; and afterwards , when i searched the ship again , i could not come at any pipes .",154
"how strange a chequer - work of providence is the life of man ! and by what secret different springs are the affections hurried about , as different circumstances present ! to - day we love what to - morrow we hate ; to - day we seek what to - morrow we shun ; to - day we desire what to - morrow we fear , nay , even tremble at the apprehensions of . this was exemplified in me , at this time , in the most lively manner imaginable ; for i , whose only affliction was that i seemed banished from human society , that i was alone , circumscribed by the boundless ocean , cut off from mankind , and condemned to what i call silent life ; that i was as one whom heaven thought not worthy to be numbered among the living , or to appear among the rest of his creatures ; that to have seen one of my own species would have seemed to me a raising me from death to life , and the greatest blessing that heaven itself , next to the supreme blessing of salvation , could bestow ; i say , that i should now tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a man , and was ready to sink into the ground at but the shadow or silent appearance of a man having set his foot in the island .",140
"i can now conjecture readily that this streak of light was , in all likelihood , a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn : but then , prepared as my mind was for horror , shaken as my nerves were by agitation , i thought the swift darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world . my heart beat thick , my head grew hot ; a sound filled my ears , which i deemed the rushing of wings ; something seemed near me ; i was oppressed , suffocated : endurance broke down ; i rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort .",49
