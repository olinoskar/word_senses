"under these conditions the barometer generally stayed quite low . it fell as far as 73.5 centimeters . our compass indications no longer offered any guarantees . the deranged needles would mark contradictory directions as we approached the southern magnetic pole , which does n't coincide with the south pole proper . in fact , according to the astronomer hansteen , this magnetic pole is located fairly close to latitude 70 degrees and longitude 130 degrees , or abiding by the observations of louis - isidore duperrey , in longitude 135 degrees and latitude 70 degrees 30 ' . hence we had to transport compasses to different parts of the ship , take many readings , and strike an average . often we could chart our course only by guesswork , a less than satisfactory method in the midst of these winding passageways whose landmarks change continuously .",67

"indeed , despite its efforts , despite the powerful methods it used to split this ice , the nautilus was reduced to immobility . ordinarily , when someone ca n't go any farther , he still has the option of returning in his tracks . but here it was just as impossible to turn back as to go forward , because every passageway had closed behind us , and if our submersible remained even slightly stationary , it would be frozen in without delay . which is exactly what happened near two o'clock in the afternoon , and fresh ice kept forming over the ship 's sides with astonishing speed . i had to admit that captain nemo 's leadership had been most injudicious .",64
"a small fly or moth had fluttered across our path , and in an instant stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it . to my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire , and my acquaintance never paused for an instant , bounding from tuft to tuft behind it , his green net waving in the air . his gray clothes and jerky , zigzag , irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself . i was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the treacherous mire , when i heard the sound of steps , and turning round found a woman near me upon the path . she had come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of merripit house , but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close .",164

"meanwhile preparations for this daring attempt were getting under way . the nautilus 's powerful pumps forced air down into the tanks and stored it under high pressure . near four o'clock captain nemo informed me that the platform hatches were about to be closed . i took a last look at the dense ice bank we were going to conquer . the weather was fair , the skies reasonably clear , the cold quite brisk , namely -12 degrees centigrade ; but after the wind had lulled , this temperature did n't seem too unbearable .",44

"suddenly he started . his eyes grew strangely bright , and he gnawed nervously at his underlip . between two of the windows stood a large florentine cabinet , made out of ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue lapis . he watched it as though it were a thing that could fascinate and make afraid , as though it held something that he longed for and yet almost loathed . his breath quickened . a mad craving came over him . he lit a cigarette and then threw it away . his eyelids drooped till the long fringed lashes almost touched his cheek . but he still watched the cabinet . at last he got up from the sofa on which he had been lying , went over to it , and having unlocked it , touched some hidden spring . a triangular drawer passed slowly out . his fingers moved instinctively towards it , dipped in , and closed on something . it was a small chinese box of black and gold - dust lacquer , elaborately wrought , the sides patterned with curved waves , and the silken cords hung with round crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads . he opened it . inside was a green paste , waxy in lustre , the odour curiously heavy and persistent .",160
"half an hour later , guided by its electric trail , we reached the nautilus . the outside door had been left open , and captain nemo closed it after we reentered the first cell . then he pressed a button . i heard pumps operating within the ship , i felt the water lowering around me , and in a few moments the cell was completely empty . the inside door opened , and we passed into the wardrobe .",27
"athos took a pistol from his belt , looked to see if it was properly primed , cocked it , and placed the muzzle close to grimaud ’s ear .",24
"a cold rain began to fall , and the blurred street - lamps looked ghastly in the dripping mist . the public- houses were just closing , and dim men and women were clustering in broken groups round their doors . from some of the bars came the sound of horrible laughter . in others , drunkards brawled and screamed .",25
"the knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before the tumult ceased , steps approached , the door was opened , and d’artagnan , sword in hand , rushed into the rooms of m. bonacieux , the door of which doubtless acted upon by a spring , closed after him .",51
"the neighbors who had opened their windows , with the coolness peculiar to the inhabitants of paris in these times of perpetual riots and disturbances , closed them again as soon as they saw the four men in black flee -- their instinct telling them that for the time all was over .",26
"there the ocean floor formed a valley 120 kilometers wide , into which you could fit mt . blanc without its summit poking above the surface of the waves . this valley is closed off to the east by a sheer wall 2,000 meters high . we arrived there on may 28 , and the nautilus lay no farther than 150 kilometers from ireland . would captain nemo head up north and beach us on the british isles ? no . much to my surprise , he went back down south and returned to european seas . as we swung around the emerald isle , i spotted cape clear for an instant , plus the lighthouse on fastnet rock that guides all those thousands of ships setting out from glasgow or liverpool .",33
"while d’artagnan was examining mme . bonacieux , and was , as we have said , close to her , he saw on the ground a fine cambric handkerchief , which he picked up , as was his habit , and at the corner of which he recognized the same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had nearly caused him and aramis to cut each other ’s throat .",16
"i returned to the lounge . the hatch closed , and i heard water hissing in the ballast tanks . the nautilus began to sink on a vertical line , because its propeller was in check and no longer furnished any forward motion .",8
"dorian gray hurried along the quay through the drizzling rain . his meeting with adrian singleton had strangely moved him , and he wondered if the ruin of that young life was really to be laid at his door , as basil hallward had said to him with such infamy of insult . he bit his lip , and for a few seconds his eyes grew sad . yet , after all , what did it matter to him ? one 's days were too brief to take the burden of another 's errors on one 's shoulders . each man lived his own life and paid his own price for living it . the only pity was one had to pay so often for a single fault . one had to pay over and over again , indeed . in her dealings with man , destiny never closed her accounts .",148
"james vane stood on the pavement in horror . he was trembling from head to foot . after a little while , a black shadow that had been creeping along the dripping wall moved out into the light and came close to him with stealthy footsteps . he felt a hand laid on his arm and looked round with a start . it was one of the women who had been drinking at the bar .",40
"it was still what sailors call "" a close - reefed topsail breeze , "" but the commotion in the elements had none the less considerably diminished .",8
""" why did n't you kill him ? "" she hissed out , putting haggard face quite close to his . "" i knew you were following him when you rushed out from daly 's . you fool ! you should have killed him . he has lots of money , and he 's as bad as bad . """,17
""" you 're mighty close about this affair , mr . holmes . what 's the game now ? """,4
"then , swallowing the contents of his glass , which he put down close to him , athos arose carelessly , took the musket next to him , and drew near to one of the loopholes .",13
""" no doubt you could , only there is one misfortune , and that is that monsieur bonacieux is known at the louvre , and would be allowed to pass ; whereas you are not known there , and the gate would be closed against you . """,43
i was obliged to recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious interest to me .,15
"a sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor . crouching among the stones we stared intently at the silver - tipped bank in front of us . the steps grew louder , and through the fog , as through a curtain , there stepped the man whom we were awaiting . he looked round him in surprise as he emerged into the clear , starlit night . then he came swiftly along the path , passed close to where we lay , and went on up the long slope behind us . as he walked he glanced continually over either shoulder , like a man who is ill at ease .",79

"a dog accompanied the voyagers , and was held pressed close to his master in the meshes of the net .",10
milady in the course of the conversation twice or thrice bit her lips ; she had to deal with a gascon who played close .,23
"we went into the library . just as i pushed open the door leading to the well of the central companionway , i heard the hatch close sharply overhead .",26
"for a moment i feared the words might be my own , brought back by the echo . perhaps i had been crying out unknown to myself . i closed my lips firmly , and laid my ear against the wall again .",29
"the panels closed over this frightful view , but the lights did n't go on in the lounge . inside the nautilus all was gloom and silence . it left this place of devastation with prodigious speed , 100 feet beneath the waters . where was it going ? north or south ? where would the man flee after this horrible act of revenge ?",2
"i estimate -- but perhaps i 'm mistaken -- that the nautilus 's haphazard course continued for fifteen or twenty days , and i 'm not sure how long this would have gone on without the catastrophe that ended our voyage . as for captain nemo , he was no longer in the picture . as for his chief officer , the same applied . not one crewman was visible for a single instant . the nautilus cruised beneath the waters almost continuously . when it rose briefly to the surface to renew our air , the hatches opened and closed as if automated . no more positions were reported on the world map . i did n't know where we were .",100
"a true northerner , thin , bony , lean , about forty - five years of age ; his close - cut hair and his beard , of which he only kept a thick mustache , were already getting gray .",19

"on closer examination , you detected something in his face that displeased , or rather that failed to please . his features were regular , but too relaxed : his eye was large and well cut , but the life looking out of it was a tame , vacant life -- at least so i thought . the sound of the dressing - bell dispersed the party .",1
"at the moment she entered , the curtain of a small gallery which to that time had been closed , was drawn , and the pale face of the cardinal appeared , he being dressed as a spanish cavalier .",18

"placed where he was , d’artagnan could not perceive the face of aramis . we say aramis , because the young man entertained no doubt that it was his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of the exterior . curiosity prevailed over prudence ; and profiting by the preoccupation into which the sight of the handkerchief appeared to have plunged the two personages now on the scene , he stole from his hiding place , and quick as lightning , but stepping with utmost caution , he ran and placed himself close to the angle of the wall , from which his eye could pierce the interior of aramis ’s room .",96

"and he was right . imagine the large development attained by these plants , which prefer a warm , moist climate . i knew that the _ lycopodon giganteum _ attains , according to bulliard , a circumference of eight or nine feet ; but here were pale mushrooms , thirty to forty feet high , and crowned with a cap of equal diameter . there they stood in thousands . no light could penetrate between their huge cones , and complete darkness reigned beneath those giants ; they formed settlements of domes placed in close array like the round , thatched roofs of a central african city .",95

"and ethelred uplifted his mace , and struck upon the head of the dragon , which fell before him , and gave up his pesty breath , with a shriek so horrid and harsh , and withal so piercing , that ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it , the like whereof was never before heard . ”",45

"while i gazed , this fissure rapidly widened — there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind — the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sight — my brain reeled as i saw the mighty walls rushing asunder — there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters — and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the “ house of usher . ”",67
"i lay here , however , two days , because the wind blowing pretty fresh at ese . , and that being just contrary to the current , made a great breach of the sea upon the point : so that it was not safe for me to keep too close to the shore for the breach , nor to go too far off , because of the stream .",50
"for what can be more absurd than to persist in carrying a burden of which we wish to be eased ? to detest , and yet to strive to preserve our existence ? in a word , to caress the serpent that devours us , and hug him close to our bosoms till he has gnawed into our hearts ?",48
"when i was on shore , god i fell on my knees and gave god thanks for my deliverance , resolving to lay aside all thoughts of my deliverance by my boat ; and refreshing myself with such things as i had , i brought my boat close to the shore , in a little cove that i had spied under some trees , and laid me down to sleep , being quite spent with the labour and fatigue of the voyage .",47
"so she was considering in her own mind ( as well as she could , for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid ) , whether the pleasure of making a daisy - chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies , when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her .",59
"alice was not a bit hurt , and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment : she looked up , but it was all dark overhead ; before her was another long passage , and the white rabbit was still in sight , hurrying down it . there was not a moment to be lost : away went alice like the wind , and was just in time to hear it say , as it turned a corner , ' oh my ears and whiskers , how late it 's getting ! ' she was close behind it when she turned the corner , but the rabbit was no longer to be seen : she found herself in a long , low hall , which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof . there were doors all round the hall , but they were all locked ; and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other , trying every door , she walked sadly down the middle , wondering how she was ever to get out again .",98
"then i heard the hatches close . the sea 's undulations , which had been creating a gentle rocking motion , now ceased . had the nautilus left the surface of the ocean ? was it reentering the motionless strata deep in the sea ?",5

"we turned on our ruhmkorff devices and went along a coral shoal in the process of forming , which , given time , will someday close off this whole part of the indian ocean . our path was bordered by hopelessly tangled bushes , formed from snarls of shrubs all covered with little star - shaped , white - streaked flowers . only , contrary to plants on shore , these tree forms become attached to rocks on the seafloor by heading from top to bottom .",25
