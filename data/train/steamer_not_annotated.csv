""" water ! "" cried pencroft , "" water as fuel for steamers and engines ! water to heat water ! """,12
"that favourable moment arrived only with six o'clock ; when my uncle , myself , the guide , two other passengers and the four horses , trusted ourselves to a somewhat fragile raft . accustomed as i was to the swift and sure steamers on the elbe , i found the oars of the rowers rather a slow means of propulsion . it took us more than an hour to cross the fiord ; but the passage was effected without any mishap .",43
"they entered the steamer office and secured cabins for four persons . the clerk , as he gave them the tickets , informed them that , the repairs on the carnatic having been completed , the steamer would leave that very evening , and not next morning , as had been announced .",3

"these were the only words he uttered during the journey . aouda , cosily packed in furs and cloaks , was sheltered as much as possible from the attacks of the freezing wind . as for passepartout , his face was as red as the sun 's disc when it sets in the mist , and he laboriously inhaled the biting air . with his natural buoyancy of spirits , he began to hope again . they would reach new york on the evening , if not on the morning , of the 11th , and there was still some chances that it would be before the steamer sailed for liverpool .",107
"mr . fogg learned all this in consulting his bradshaw , which gave him the daily movements of the trans - atlantic steamers .",22
"mr . fogg was quite ready . under his arm might have been observed a red - bound copy of bradshaw 's continental railway steam transit and general guide , with its timetables showing the arrival and departure of steamers and railways . he took the carpet - bag , opened it , and slipped into it a goodly roll of bank of england notes , which would pass wherever he might go .",39
""" so did i , madam , and i am excessively disappointed . the carnatic , its repairs being completed , left hong kong twelve hours before the stated time , without any notice being given ; and we must now wait a week for another steamer . """,46
"during the first days , they went along smoothly enough . the sea was not very unpropitious , the wind seemed stationary in the north - east , the sails were hoisted , and the henrietta ploughed across the waves like a real trans - atlantic steamer .",46
"when cyrus harding and his companions recovered consciousness , thanks to the attention lavished upon them , they found themselves in the cabin of a steamer , without being able to comprehend how they had escaped death .",25
""" that 's just where you 're mistaken , professor , "" ned replied . "" the common man may still believe in fabulous comets crossing outer space , or in prehistoric monsters living at the earth 's core , but astronomers and geologists do n't swallow such fairy tales . it 's the same with whalers . i 've chased plenty of cetaceans , i 've harpooned a good number , i 've killed several . but no matter how powerful and well armed they were , neither their tails or their tusks could puncture the sheet - iron plates of a steamer . """,103
""" pilot , "" said mr . fogg , "" i must take the american steamer at yokohama , and not at shanghai or nagasaki . """,15
""" why not ? "" returned the pilot . "" the san francisco steamer does not start from yokohama . it puts in at yokohama and nagasaki , but it starts from shanghai . """,13
"at this moment , also , a long black funnel , crowned with wreaths of smoke , appeared on the edge of the waters . it was the american steamer , leaving for yokohama at the appointed time .",29
"the flag was run up at half - mast , and , this being the signal of distress , it was hoped that the american steamer , perceiving it , would change her course a little , so as to succour the pilot - boat .",25
"at dawn on the 13th the carnatic entered the port of yokohama . this is an important port of call in the pacific , where all the mail - steamers , and those carrying travellers between north america , china , japan , and the oriental islands put in . it is situated in the bay of yeddo , and at but a short distance from that second capital of the japanese empire , and the residence of the tycoon , the civil emperor , before the mikado , the spiritual emperor , absorbed his office in his own . the carnatic anchored at the quay near the custom - house , in the midst of a crowd of ships bearing the flags of all nations .",29
"having uttered these words with a cool , careless air , the detective took leave of the consul , and repaired to the telegraph office , whence he sent the dispatch which we have seen to the london police office . a quarter of an hour later found fix , with a small bag in his hand , proceeding on board the mongolia ; and , ere many moments longer , the noble steamer rode out at full steam upon the waters of the red sea .",73
"but , if he thought of these possibilities , he did not betray the fact by any outward sign . always the same impassible member of the reform club , whom no incident could surprise , as unvarying as the ship 's chronometers , and seldom having the curiosity even to go upon the deck , he passed through the memorable scenes of the red sea with cold indifference ; did not care to recognise the historic towns and villages which , along its borders , raised their picturesque outlines against the sky ; and betrayed no fear of the dangers of the arabic gulf , which the old historians always spoke of with horror , and upon which the ancient navigators never ventured without propitiating the gods by ample sacrifices . how did this eccentric personage pass his time on the mongolia ? he made his four hearty meals every day , regardless of the most persistent rolling and pitching on the part of the steamer ; and he played whist indefatigably , for he had found partners as enthusiastic in the game as himself .",166
"passepartout was not the man to let an idea go begging , and directed his steps towards the docks . but , as he approached them , his project , which at first had seemed so simple , began to grow more and more formidable to his mind . what need would they have of a cook or servant on an american steamer , and what confidence would they put in him , dressed as he was ? what references could he give ?",62
"the mongolia had still sixteen hundred and fifty miles to traverse before reaching bombay , and was obliged to remain four hours at steamer point to coal up . but this delay , as it was foreseen , did not affect phileas fogg 's programme ; besides , the mongolia , instead of reaching aden on the morning of the 15th , when she was due , arrived there on the evening of the 14th , a gain of fifteen hours .",23
"mr . fogg and his servant went ashore at aden to have the passport again visaed ; fix , unobserved , followed them . the visa procured , mr . fogg returned on board to resume his former habits ; while passepartout , according to custom , sauntered about among the mixed population of somalis , banyans , parsees , jews , arabs , and europeans who comprise the twenty - five thousand inhabitants of aden . he gazed with wonder upon the fortifications which make this place the gibraltar of the indian ocean , and the vast cisterns where the english engineers were still at work , two thousand years after the engineers of solomon . "" very curious , very curious , "" said passepartout to himself , on returning to the steamer . "" i see that it is by no means useless to travel , if a man wants to see something new . """,134
"thus ended this memorable seance . that conversation threw me into a fever . i came out of my uncle 's study as if i had been stunned , and as if there was not air enough in all the streets of hamburg to put me right again . i therefore made for the banks of the elbe , where the steamer lands her passengers , which forms the communication between the city and the hamburg railway .",61
"on friday , september the 4th , we embarked on the steamer volturno , employed by the french messageries imperiales , and in three days more we were at marseilles , having no care on our minds except that abominable deceitful compass , which we had mislaid somewhere and could not now examine ; but its inexplicable behaviour exercised my mind fearfully . on the 9th of september , in the evening , we arrived at hamburg .",11
"what happened when the pilot - boat came in sight of shanghai will be easily guessed . the signals made by the tankadere had been seen by the captain of the yokohama steamer , who , espying the flag at half - mast , had directed his course towards the little craft . phileas fogg , after paying the stipulated price of his passage to john busby , and rewarding that worthy with the additional sum of five hundred and fifty pounds , ascended the steamer with aouda and fix ; and they started at once for nagasaki and yokohama .",32
"the san francisco steamer was announced to leave that very evening , and it became necessary to find passepartout , if possible , without delay . mr . fogg applied in vain to the french and english consuls , and , after wandering through the streets a long time , began to despair of finding his missing servant . chance , or perhaps a kind of presentiment , at last led him into the honourable mr . batulcar 's theatre . he certainly would not have recognised passepartout in the eccentric mountebank 's costume ; but the latter , lying on his back , perceived his master in the gallery . he could not help starting , which so changed the position of his nose as to bring the "" pyramid "" pell - mell upon the stage .",3
"passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie . up to his arrival at bombay , he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there ; but , now that they were plainly whirling across india at full speed , a sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams . his old vagabond nature returned to him ; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took possession of him . he came to regard his master 's project as intended in good earnest , believed in the reality of the bet , and therefore in the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail within the designated period . already he began to worry about possible delays , and accidents which might happen on the way . he recognised himself as being personally interested in the wager , and trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable folly of the night before . being much less cool - headed than mr . fogg , he was much more restless , counting and recounting the days passed over , uttering maledictions when the train stopped , and accusing it of sluggishness , and mentally blaming mr . fogg for not having bribed the engineer . the worthy fellow was ignorant that , while it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer , it could not be done on the railway .",240
"the steamer which was about to depart from yokohama to san francisco belonged to the pacific mail steamship company , and was named the general grant . she was a large paddle - wheel steamer of two thousand five hundred tons ; well equipped and very fast . the massive walking - beam rose and fell above the deck ; at one end a piston - rod worked up and down ; and at the other was a connecting - rod which , in changing the rectilinear motion to a circular one , was directly connected with the shaft of the paddles . the general grant was rigged with three masts , giving a large capacity for sails , and thus materially aiding the steam power . by making twelve miles an hour , she would cross the ocean in twenty - one days . phileas fogg was therefore justified in hoping that he would reach san francisco by the 2nd of december , new york by the 11th , and london on the 20th -- thus gaining several hours on the fatal date of the 21st of december .",34
""" no , "" replied fix coldly , "" i think him a rascal . sh ! do n't budge , and let me speak . as long as mr . fogg was on english ground , it was for my interest to detain him there until my warrant of arrest arrived . i did everything i could to keep him back . i sent the bombay priests after him , i got you intoxicated at hong kong , i separated you from him , and i made him miss the yokohama steamer . """,92
"he had not proceeded two hundred steps , however , when , "" by the greatest chance in the world , "" he met fix . the detective seemed wholly taken by surprise . what ! had mr . fogg and himself crossed the pacific together , and not met on the steamer ! at least fix felt honoured to behold once more the gentleman to whom he owed so much , and , as his business recalled him to europe , he should be delighted to continue the journey in such pleasant company .",52
"i was ordered to direct my feet that way ; i embarked on a small steamer which plies on the canals , and in a few minutes she touched the quay of the dockyard .",15
""" you were in the habit of playing whist , "" resumed fix , "" on the steamers . """,17
"after nightfall the storm grew in intensity . as in the 1860 cyclone on réunion island , the barometer fell to 710 millimeters . at the close of day , i saw a big ship passing on the horizon , struggling painfully . it lay to at half steam in an effort to hold steady on the waves . it must have been a steamer on one of those lines out of new york to liverpool or le havre . it soon vanished into the shadows .",64
"dorian started and peered round . "" this will do , "" he answered , and having got out hastily and given the driver the extra fare he had promised him , he walked quickly in the direction of the quay . here and there a lantern gleamed at the stern of some huge merchantman . the light shook and splintered in the puddles . a red glare came from an outward - bound steamer that was coaling . the slimy pavement looked like a wet mackintosh .",74
"the rangoon was moored half a mile off in the harbour , its signal of departure hoisted at the mast - head . eleven o'clock was striking ; mr . fogg was an hour in advance of time . fix saw them leave the carriage and push off in a boat for the steamer , and stamped his feet with disappointment .",53
"the steamer passed along near the shores , but the savage papuans , who are in the lowest scale of humanity , but are not , as has been asserted , cannibals , did not make their appearance .",1
"fix emerged from his cabin and went on deck . passepartout was promenading up and down in the forward part of the steamer . the detective rushed forward with every appearance of extreme surprise , and exclaimed , "" you here , on the rangoon ? """,22
