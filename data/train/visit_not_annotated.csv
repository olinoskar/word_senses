"i would have been deeply interested in visiting this long , 360-league reef , against which the ever - surging sea broke with the fearsome intensity of thunderclaps . but just then the nautilus 's slanting fins took us to great depths , and i could see nothing of those high coral walls . i had to rest content with the various specimens of fish brought up by our nets . among others i noted some long - finned albacore , a species in the genus scomber , as big as tuna , bluish on the flanks , and streaked with crosswise stripes that disappear when the animal dies . these fish followed us in schools and supplied our table with very dainty flesh . we also caught a large number of yellow - green gilthead , half a decimeter long and tasting like dorado , plus some flying gurnards , authentic underwater swallows that , on dark nights , alternately streak air and water with their phosphorescent glimmers . among mollusks and zoophytes , i found in our trawl 's meshes various species of alcyonarian coral , sea urchins , hammer shells , spurred - star shells , wentletrap snails , horn shells , glass snails . the local flora was represented by fine floating algae : sea tangle , and kelp from the genus macrocystis , saturated with the mucilage their pores perspire , from which i selected a wonderful nemastoma geliniaroidea , classifying it with the natural curiosities in the museum .",7
"from that day forward , who knows where the nautilus took us in the north atlantic basin ? always at incalculable speed ! always amid the high arctic mists ! did it call at the capes of spitzbergen or the shores of novaya zemlya ? did it visit such uncharted seas as the white sea , the kara sea , the gulf of ob , the lyakhov islands , or those unknown beaches on the siberian coast ? i 'm unable to say . i lost track of the passing hours . time was in abeyance on the ship 's clocks . as happens in the polar regions , it seemed that night and day no longer followed their normal sequence . i felt myself being drawn into that strange domain where the overwrought imagination of edgar allan poe was at home . like his fabled arthur gordon pym , i expected any moment to see that "" shrouded human figure , very far larger in its proportions than any dweller among men , "" thrown across the cataract that protects the outskirts of the pole !",47

"meanwhile the reddish light guiding us had expanded and inflamed the horizon . the presence of this furnace under the waters had me extremely puzzled . was it some sort of electrical discharge ? was i approaching some natural phenomenon still unknown to scientists on shore ? or , rather ( and this thought did cross my mind ) , had the hand of man intervened in that blaze ? had human beings fanned those flames ? in these deep strata would i meet up with more of captain nemo 's companions , friends he was about to visit who led lives as strange as his own ? would i find a whole colony of exiles down here , men tired of the world 's woes , men who had sought and found independence in the ocean 's lower depths ? all these insane , inadmissible ideas dogged me , and in this frame of mind , continually excited by the series of wonders passing before my eyes , i would n't have been surprised to find on this sea bottom one of those underwater towns captain nemo dreamed about !",98
