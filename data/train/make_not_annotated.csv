"these stones , when decomposed by heat , made a very strong quicklime , greatly increased by slacking , at least as pure as if it had been produced by the calcination of chalk or marble .",8
"we must mention here that pencroft , desirous to know if the clay thus prepared was worthy of its name of pipe - clay , made some large pipes , which he thought charming , but for which , alas ! he had no tobacco , and that was a great privation to pencroft .",25

"suddenly my uncle uttered a cry . i thought his foot must have slipped and that he had fallen down one of the holes . but , no ; i saw him , with arms outstretched and legs straddling wide apart , erect before a granite rock that stood in the centre of the crater , just like a pedestal made ready to receive a statue of pluto . he stood like a man stupefied , but the stupefaction soon gave way to delirious rapture .",60

"even now i can not help feeling that it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is ever really shown in the work one creates . art is always more abstract than we fancy . form and colour tell us of form and colour -- that is all . it often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely than it ever reveals him . and so when i got this offer from paris , i determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition . it never occurred to me that you would refuse . i see now that you were right . the picture can not be shown . you must not be angry with me , dorian , for what i have told you . as i said to harry , once , you are made to be worshipped .

"dorian gray drew a long breath . the colour came back to his cheeks , and a smile played about his lips . the peril was over . he was safe for the time . yet he could not help feeling infinite pity for the painter who had just made this strange confession to him , and wondered if he himself would ever be so dominated by the personality of a friend . lord henry had the charm of being very dangerous . but that was all . he was too clever and too cynical to be really fond of . would there ever be some one who would fill him with a strange idolatry ? was that one of the things that life had in store ?",49

"he frowned , and tearing the paper in two , went across the room and flung the pieces away . how ugly it all was ! and how horribly real ugliness made things ! he felt a little annoyed with lord henry for having sent him the report . and it was certainly stupid of him to have marked it with red pencil . victor might have read it . the man knew more than enough english for that .",31
"his eye fell on the yellow book that lord henry had sent him . what was it , he wondered . he went towards the little , pearl - coloured octagonal stand that had always looked to him like the work of some strange egyptian bees that wrought in silver , and taking up the volume , flung himself into an arm - chair and began to turn over the leaves . after a few minutes he became absorbed . it was the strangest book that he had ever read . it seemed to him that in exquisite raiment , and to the delicate sound of flutes , the sins of the world were passing in dumb show before him . things that he had dimly dreamed of were suddenly made real to him . things of which he had never dreamed were gradually revealed .",130
"it was a poisonous book . the heavy odour of incense seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain . the mere cadence of the sentences , the subtle monotony of their music , so full as it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately repeated , produced in the mind of the lad , as he passed from chapter to chapter , a form of reverie , a malady of dreaming , that made him unconscious of the falling day and creeping shadows .",77

"the worship of the senses has often , and with much justice , been decried , men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and sensations that seem stronger than themselves , and that they are conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence . but it appeared to dorian gray that the true nature of the senses had never been understood , and that they had remained savage and animal merely because the world had sought to starve them into submission or to kill them by pain , instead of aiming at making them elements of a new spirituality , of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the dominant characteristic .",97
"he discovered wonderful stories , also , about jewels . in alphonso 's clericalis disciplina a serpent was mentioned with eyes of real jacinth , and in the romantic history of alexander , the conqueror of emathia was said to have found in the vale of jordan snakes "" with collars of real emeralds growing on their backs . "" there was a gem in the brain of the dragon , philostratus told us , and "" by the exhibition of golden letters and a scarlet robe "" the monster could be thrown into a magical sleep and slain . according to the great alchemist , pierre de boniface , the diamond rendered a man invisible , and the agate of india made him eloquent . the cornelian appeased anger , and the hyacinth provoked sleep , and the amethyst drove away the fumes of wine . the garnet cast out demons , and the hydropicus deprived the moon of her colour . the selenite waxed and waned with the moon , and the meloceus , that discovers thieves , could be affected only by the blood of kids . leonardus camillus had seen a white stone taken from the brain of a newly killed toad , that was a certain antidote against poison . the bezoar , that was found in the heart of the arabian deer , was a charm that could cure the plague . in the nests of arabian birds was the aspilates , that , according to democritus , kept the wearer from any danger by fire .",122
"yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many his strange and dangerous charm . his great wealth was a certain element of security . society -- civilized society , at least-- is never very ready to believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and fascinating . it feels instinctively that manners are of more importance than morals , and , in its opinion , the highest respectability is of much less value than the possession of a good chef . and , after all , it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has given one a bad dinner , or poor wine , is irreproachable in his private life . even the cardinal virtues can not atone for half - cold entrées , as lord henry remarked once , in a discussion on the subject , and there is possibly a good deal to be said for his view . for the canons of good society are , or should be , the same as the canons of art . form is absolutely essential to it . it should have the dignity of a ceremony , as well as its unreality , and should combine the insincere character of a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us . is insincerity such a terrible thing ? i think not . it is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities .",221
"yet one had ancestors in literature as well as in one 's own race , nearer perhaps in type and temperament , many of them , and certainly with an influence of which one was more absolutely conscious . there were times when it appeared to dorian gray that the whole of history was merely the record of his own life , not as he had lived it in act and circumstance , but as his imagination had created it for him , as it had been in his brain and in his passions . he felt that he had known them all , those strange terrible figures that had passed across the stage of the world and made sin so marvellous and evil so full of subtlety . it seemed to him that in some mysterious way their lives had been his own .",118

"the worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat as hearty a breakfast as possible before leaving the carnatic ; but , as he had been walking about all day , the demands of hunger were becoming importunate . he observed that the butchers stalls contained neither mutton , goat , nor pork ; and , knowing also that it is a sacrilege to kill cattle , which are preserved solely for farming , he made up his mind that meat was far from plentiful in yokohama -- nor was he mistaken ; and , in default of butcher 's meat , he could have wished for a quarter of wild boar or deer , a partridge , or some quails , some game or fish , which , with rice , the japanese eat almost exclusively . but he found it necessary to keep up a stout heart , and to postpone the meal he craved till the following morning . night came , and passepartout re - entered the native quarter , where he wandered through the streets , lit by vari - coloured lanterns , looking on at the dancers , who were executing skilful steps and boundings , and the astrologers who stood in the open air with their telescopes . then he came to the harbour , which was lit up by the resin torches of the fishermen , who were fishing from their boats .",76

"what happened when the pilot - boat came in sight of shanghai will be easily guessed . the signals made by the tankadere had been seen by the captain of the yokohama steamer , who , espying the flag at half - mast , had directed his course towards the little craft . phileas fogg , after paying the stipulated price of his passage to john busby , and rewarding that worthy with the additional sum of five hundred and fifty pounds , ascended the steamer with aouda and fix ; and they started at once for nagasaki and yokohama .",19
"by inclining his stick to the side opposite to the sun , cyrus harding made the shadow longer , and consequently its modifications would be more easily ascertained .",14
"the steamer which was about to depart from yokohama to san francisco belonged to the pacific mail steamship company , and was named the general grant . she was a large paddle - wheel steamer of two thousand five hundred tons ; well equipped and very fast . the massive walking - beam rose and fell above the deck ; at one end a piston - rod worked up and down ; and at the other was a connecting - rod which , in changing the rectilinear motion to a circular one , was directly connected with the shaft of the paddles . the general grant was rigged with three masts , giving a large capacity for sails , and thus materially aiding the steam power . by making twelve miles an hour , she would cross the ocean in twenty - one days . phileas fogg was therefore justified in hoping that he would reach san francisco by the 2nd of december , new york by the 11th , and london on the 20th -- thus gaining several hours on the fatal date of the 21st of december .",128
"on the ninth day after leaving yokohama , phileas fogg had traversed exactly one half of the terrestrial globe . the general grant passed , on the 23rd of november , the one hundred and eightieth meridian , and was at the very antipodes of london . mr . fogg had , it is true , exhausted fifty - two of the eighty days in which he was to complete the tour , and there were only twenty - eight left . but , though he was only half - way by the difference of meridians , he had really gone over two - thirds of the whole journey ; for he had been obliged to make long circuits from london to aden , from aden to bombay , from calcutta to singapore , and from singapore to yokohama . could he have followed without deviation the fiftieth parallel , which is that of london , the whole distance would only have been about twelve thousand miles ; whereas he would be forced , by the irregular methods of locomotion , to traverse twenty - six thousand , of which he had , on the 23rd of november , accomplished seventeen thousand five hundred . and now the course was a straight one , and fix was no longer there to put obstacles in their way !",116
"it happened also , on the 23rd of november , that passepartout made a joyful discovery . it will be remembered that the obstinate fellow had insisted on keeping his famous family watch at london time , and on regarding that of the countries he had passed through as quite false and unreliable . now , on this day , though he had not changed the hands , he found that his watch exactly agreed with the ship 's chronometers . his triumph was hilarious . he would have liked to know what fix would say if he were aboard !",12

"there mr . fogg examined a curious vehicle , a kind of frame on two long beams , a little raised in front like the runners of a sledge , and upon which there was room for five or six persons . a high mast was fixed on the frame , held firmly by metallic lashings , to which was attached a large brigantine sail . this mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist a jib - sail . behind , a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle . it was , in short , a sledge rigged like a sloop . during the winter , when the trains are blocked up by the snow , these sledges make extremely rapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another . provided with more sails than a cutter , and with the wind behind them , they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not superior to that of the express trains .",122

"as to going home , shame opposed the best motions that offered to my thoughts , and it immediately occurred to me how i should be laughed at among the neighbours , and should be ashamed to see , not my father and mother only , but even everybody else ; from whence i have since often observed , how incongruous and irrational the common temper of mankind is , especially of youth , to that reason which ought to guide them in such cases — viz . that they are not ashamed to sin , and yet are ashamed to repent ; not ashamed of the action for which they ought justly to be esteemed fools , but are ashamed of the returning , which only can make them be esteemed wise men .",128

"here i meditated nothing but my escape , and what method i might take to effect it , but found no way that had the least probability in it ; nothing presented to make the supposition of it rational ; for i had nobody to communicate it to that would embark with me — no fellow - slave , no englishman , irishman , or scotchman there but myself ; so that for two years , though i often pleased myself with the imagination , yet i never had the least encouraging prospect of putting it in practice .",33

"the entrance into this place i made to be , not by a door , but by a short ladder to go over the top ; which ladder , when i was in , i lifted over after me ; and so i was completely fenced in and fortified , as i thought , from all the world , and consequently slept secure in the night , which otherwise i could not have done ; though , as it appeared afterwards , there was no need of all this caution from the enemies that i apprehended danger from .",6

"after i had been there about ten or twelve days , it came into my thoughts that i should lose my reckoning of time for want of books , and pen and ink , and should even forget the sabbath days ; but to prevent this , i cut with my knife upon a large post , in capital letters — and making it into a great cross , i set it up on the shore where i first landed—“i came on shore here on the 30th september 1659 . ” upon the sides of this square post i cut every day a notch with my knife , and every seventh notch was as long again as the rest , and every first day of the month as long again as that long one ; and thus i kept my calendar , or weekly , monthly , and yearly reckoning of time .",62

"_ note_.—during all this time i worked to make this room or cave spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse or magazine , a kitchen , a dining - room , and a cellar . as for my lodging , i kept to the tent ; except that sometimes , in the wet season of the year , it rained so hard that i could not keep myself dry , which caused me afterwards to cover all my place within my pale with long poles , in the form of rafters , leaning against the rock , and load them with flags and large leaves of trees , like a thatch .",8
"_ dec . _ 20.—now i carried everything into the cave , and began to furnish my house , and set up some pieces of boards like a dresser , to order my victuals upon ; but boards began to be very scarce with me ; also , i made me another table .",49

"it might be truly said , that now i worked for my bread . i believe few people have thought much upon the strange multitude of little things necessary in the providing , producing , curing , dressing , making , and finishing this one article of bread . i , that was reduced to a mere state of nature , found this to my daily discouragement ; and was made more sensible of it every hour , even after i had got the first handful of seed - corn , which , as i have said , came up unexpectedly , and indeed to a surprise .",70

"thus i lived mighty comfortably , my mind being entirely composed by resigning myself to the will of god , and throwing myself wholly upon the disposal of his providence . this made my life better than sociable , for when i began to regret the want of conversation i would ask myself , whether thus conversing mutually with my own thoughts , and ( as i hope i may say ) with even god himself , by ejaculations , was not better than the utmost enjoyment of human society in the world ?",32
"i lay here , however , two days , because the wind blowing pretty fresh at ese . , and that being just contrary to the current , made a great breach of the sea upon the point : so that it was not safe for me to keep too close to the shore for the breach , nor to go too far off , because of the stream .",28
"about four o’clock in the evening , being then within a league of the island , i found the point of the rocks which occasioned this disaster stretching out , as is described before , to the southward , and casting off the current more southerly , had , of course , made another eddy to the north ; and this i found very strong , but not directly setting the way my course lay , which was due west , but almost full north . however , having a fresh gale , i stretched across this eddy , slanting north - west ; and in about an hour came within about a mile of the shore , where , it being smooth water , i soon got to land .",52

"the old man listened attentively , making a sign only that it was all so ; and then , when d’artagnan had ended , he shook his head with an air that announced nothing good .",6
"in the middle of the clearing , on a pedestal of roughly piled rocks , there stood a cross of coral , extending long arms you would have thought were made of petrified blood .",30

"that day , january 21 , 1868 , the chief officer went at noon to take the sun 's altitude . i climbed onto the platform , lit a cigar , and watched him at work . it seemed obvious to me that this man did n't understand french , because i made several remarks in a loud voice that were bound to provoke him to some involuntary show of interest had he understood them ; but he remained mute and emotionless .",52
"all in all , we enjoyed a highly satisfactory state of health . the diet on board agreed with us perfectly , and for my part , i could easily have gone without those changes of pace that ned land , in a spirit of protest , kept taxing his ingenuity to supply us . what 's more , in this constant temperature we did n't even have to worry about catching colds . besides , the ship had a good stock of the madrepore dendrophylia , known in provence by the name sea fennel , and a poultice made from the dissolved flesh of its polyps will furnish an excellent cough medicine .",99
"for some days we saw a large number of aquatic birds with webbed feet , known as gulls or sea mews . some were skillfully slain , and when cooked in a certain fashion , they make a very acceptable platter of water game . among the great wind riders -- carried over long distances from every shore and resting on the waves from their exhausting flights-- i spotted some magnificent albatross , birds belonging to the longipennes ( long - winged ) family , whose discordant calls sound like the braying of an ass . the totipalmes ( fully webbed ) family was represented by swift frigate birds , nimbly catching fish at the surface , and by numerous tropic birds of the genus phaeton , among others the red - tailed tropic bird , the size of a pigeon , its white plumage shaded with pink tints that contrasted with its dark - hued wings .",36
"the nautilus 's nets hauled up several types of sea turtle from the hawksbill genus with arching backs whose scales are highly prized . diving easily , these reptiles can remain a good while underwater by closing the fleshy valves located at the external openings of their nasal passages . when they were captured , some hawksbills were still asleep inside their carapaces , a refuge from other marine animals . the flesh of these turtles was nothing memorable , but their eggs made an excellent feast .",83

"on january 25 , the ocean being completely deserted , the nautilus spent the day on the surface , churning the waves with its powerful propeller and making them spurt to great heights . under these conditions , who would n't have mistaken it for a gigantic cetacean ? i spent three - quarters of the day on the platform . i stared at the sea . nothing on the horizon , except near four o'clock in the afternoon a long steamer to the west , running on our opposite tack . its masting was visible for an instant , but it could n't have seen the nautilus because we were lying too low in the water . i imagine that steamboat belonged to the peninsular & oriental line , which provides service from the island of ceylon to sidney , also calling at king george sound and melbourne .",27

"during that day a fearsome school of sharks provided us with an escort . dreadful animals that teem in these seas and make them extremely dangerous . there were port jackson sharks with a brown back , a whitish belly , and eleven rows of teeth , bigeye sharks with necks marked by a large black spot encircled in white and resembling an eye , and isabella sharks whose rounded snouts were strewn with dark speckles . often these powerful animals rushed at the lounge window with a violence less than comforting . by this point ned land had lost all self - control . he wanted to rise to the surface of the waves and harpoon the monsters , especially certain smooth - hound sharks whose mouths were paved with teeth arranged like a mosaic , and some big five - meter tiger sharks that insisted on personally provoking him . but the nautilus soon picked up speed and easily left astern the fastest of these man - eaters .",22
"and really , after a day or two of confusion worse confounded , it was delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made .",26

a more perfect survey had to be made to settle the point .,7
"as she said these words her foot slipped , and in another moment , splash ! she was up to her chin in salt water . her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea , ' and in that case i can go back by railway , ' she said to herself .

"just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off , and she swam nearer to make out what it was : at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus , but then she remembered how small she was now , and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself .",20

they now had only to make a fireplace and to prepare the supper -- an easy task .,5
"by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window , and on it ( as she had hoped ) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves : she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves , and was just going to leave the room , when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking- glass . there was no label this time with the words ' drink me , ' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips .

"cacambo , who had seen many of this kind of adventures , was not discouraged . he stripped the baron of his jesuit 's habit and put it upon candide , then gave him the dead man 's three - cornered cap and made him mount on horseback . all this was done as quick as thought .",43

"alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor , and a bright idea came into her head .

"jealousy , fury , offended pride , all the passions in short that dispute the heart of an outraged woman in love , urged her to make a revelation ; but she reflected that she would be totally lost if she confessed having assisted in such a machination , and above all , that d’artagnan would also be lost to her forever .",26

""" there are maxims in this writer , "" replied pococurante , "" whence a man of the world may reap some benefit ; and the short measure of the verse makes them more easily to be retained in the memory . but i see nothing extraordinary in his journey to brundusium , and his account of his had dinner ; nor in his dirty , low quarrel between one rupillius , whose words , as he expresses it , were full of poisonous filth ; and another , whose language was dipped in vinegar .",31

""" who ?

"can i think you have any esteem for a writer who has spoiled tasso 's hell and the devil ; who transforms lucifer sometimes into a toad , and at others into a pygmy ; who makes him say the same thing over again a hundred times ; who metamorphoses him into a school - divine ; and who , by an absurdly serious imitation of ariosto 's comic invention of firearms , represents the devils and angels cannonading each other in heaven ?",36
"neither i nor any other italian can possibly take pleasure in such melancholy reveries ; but the marriage of sin and death , and snakes issuing from the womb of the former , are enough to make any person sick that is not lost to all sense of delicacy .",36

"she then tried to seize the sword with her hands ; but d’artagnan kept it free from her grasp , and presenting the point , sometimes at her eyes , sometimes at her breast , compelled her to glide behind the bedstead , while he aimed at making his retreat by the door which led to kitty ’s apartment .",47

he began by making a crucial incision from my navel to the clavicle .,3
"it is impossible for anyone to have been more lamely hanged than i had been . the executioner was a subdeacon , and knew how to burn people very well , but as for hanging , he was a novice at it , being quite out of practice ; the cord being wet , and not slipping properly , the noose did not join . in short , i still continued to breathe ; the crucial incision made me scream to such a degree , that my surgeon fell flat upon his back ; and imagining it was the devil he was dissecting , ran away , and in his fright tumbled down stairs .",77

"the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived , with a great crowd assembled about them -- all sorts of little birds and beasts , as well as the whole pack of cards : the knave was standing before them , in chains , with a soldier on each side to guard him ; and near the king was the white rabbit , with a trumpet in one hand , and a scroll of parchment in the other . in the very middle of the court was a table , with a large dish of tarts upon it : they looked so good , that it made alice quite hungry to look at them--'i wish they 'd get the trial done , ' she thought , ' and hand round the refreshments !

"they respected this sleep , and the reporter began immediately to make arrangements for transporting harding to a more comfortable place .",11
"' stupid things ! ' alice began in a loud , indignant voice , but she stopped hastily , for the white rabbit cried out , ' silence in the court ! ' and the king put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round , to make out who was talking .",46

' a nice muddle their slates'll be in before the trial 's over ! ' thought alice .",35
"one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked . this of course , alice could not stand , and she went round the court and got behind him , and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away . she did it so quickly that the poor little juror ( it was bill , the lizard ) could not make out at all what had become of it ; so , after hunting all about for it , he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day ; and this was of very little use , as it left no mark on the slate .",61
"' the queen of hearts , she made some tarts , all on a summer day : the knave of hearts , he stole those tarts , and took them quite away ! '",7

"from the corner of the divan of persian saddle - bags on which he was lying , smoking , as was his custom , innumerable cigarettes , lord henry wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey - sweet and honey- coloured blossoms of a laburnum , whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs ; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore - silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window , producing a kind of momentary japanese effect , and making him think of those pallid , jade - faced painters of tokio who , through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile , seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion .",104

"" not send it anywhere ? my dear fellow , why ? have you any reason ? what odd chaps you painters are ! you do anything in the world to gain a reputation . as soon as you have one , you seem to want to throw it away . it is silly of you , for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about , and that is not being talked about . a portrait like this would set you far above all the young men in england , and make the old men quite jealous , if old men are ever capable of any emotion .
