"this new search , after putting in at several stops over the pacific , dropped anchor before vanikoro on july 7 , 1827 , in the same harbor of vana where the nautilus was currently floating .",35
"also discredited was the idea of a floating hull or some other enormous wreckage , and again because of this speed of movement .",7
"the voyage was continued , and as the mercy appeared to flow not towards the shore , but rather towards mount franklin , it was decided that they should use the boat as long as there was enough water under its keel to float it .",43
"by methods which will at some future day be revealed he had rendered subservient the illimitable forces of electricity , which , extracted from inexhaustible sources , was employed for all the requirements of his floating equipage , as a moving , lighting , and heating agent .",35
"i would have been deeply interested in visiting this long , 360-league reef , against which the ever - surging sea broke with the fearsome intensity of thunderclaps . but just then the nautilus 's slanting fins took us to great depths , and i could see nothing of those high coral walls . i had to rest content with the various specimens of fish brought up by our nets . among others i noted some long - finned albacore , a species in the genus scomber , as big as tuna , bluish on the flanks , and streaked with crosswise stripes that disappear when the animal dies . these fish followed us in schools and supplied our table with very dainty flesh . we also caught a large number of yellow - green gilthead , half a decimeter long and tasting like dorado , plus some flying gurnards , authentic underwater swallows that , on dark nights , alternately streak air and water with their phosphorescent glimmers . among mollusks and zoophytes , i found in our trawl 's meshes various species of alcyonarian coral , sea urchins , hammer shells , spurred - star shells , wentletrap snails , horn shells , glass snails . the local flora was represented by fine floating algae : sea tangle , and kelp from the genus macrocystis , saturated with the mucilage their pores perspire , from which i selected a wonderful nemastoma geliniaroidea , classifying it with the natural curiosities in the museum .",215
"here is what those circumstances entailed . two miles to starboard lay gueboroa island , its coastline curving north to west like an immense arm . to the south and east , heads of coral were already on display , left uncovered by the ebbing waters . we had run aground at full tide and in one of those seas whose tides are moderate , an inconvenient state of affairs for floating the nautilus off . however , the ship had n't suffered in any way , so solidly joined was its hull . but although it could neither sink nor split open , it was in serious danger of being permanently attached to these reefs , and that would have been the finish of captain nemo 's submersible .",71
""" even so , captain nemo , "" i went on , ignoring his ironic turn of phrase , "" the nautilus has run aground at a moment when the sea is full . now then , the tides are n't strong in the pacific , and if you ca n't unballast the nautilus , which seems impossible to me , i do n't see how it will float off .

""" but will we float off ? "" i asked him .",4
""" well , ned my friend , we 'll serenely wait for the tide on the 9th , because it seems the moon will have the good nature to float us away ! """,29
"the captain went out , and soon i saw that at his orders , the nautilus had halted its upward movement . in fact , it soon would have hit the underbelly of the ice bank , but it had stopped in time and was floating in midwater .",45
""" could she not float in the river ? """,4
"day had returned . no ray of light penetrated into the profundity of the cavern . it being high - water , the entrance was closed by the sea . but the artificial light , which escaped in long streams from the skylights of the "" nautilus "" was as vivid as before , and the sheet of water shone around the floating vessel .",62
""" underground ! "" i exclaimed . "" and the nautilus is still floating ? """,13
"this stream of electricity dazzled my eyes , and after momentarily shutting them , i looked around . the nautilus was stationary . it was floating next to an embankment shaped like a wharf . as for the water now buoying the ship , it was a lake completely encircled by an inner wall about two miles in diameter , hence six miles around . its level -- as indicated by the pressure gauge -- would be the same as the outside level , because some connection had to exist between this lake and the sea . slanting inward over their base , these high walls converged to form a vault shaped like an immense upside - down funnel that measured 500 or 600 meters in height . at its summit there gaped the circular opening through which i had detected that faint glimmer , obviously daylight .",25
"on looking around him , however , as he could perceive no threatening object , as nothing indicated that he ran any real danger , as the bench was comfortably covered with a well - stuffed cushion , as the wall was ornamented with a beautiful cordova leather , and as large red damask curtains , fastened back by gold clasps , floated before the window , he perceived by degrees that his fear was exaggerated , and he began to turn his head to the right and the left , upward and downward .",62
"arrived at port balloon , pencroft saw with extreme satisfaction that the "" bonadventure "" was tranquilly floating in the narrow creek .",17
"the longboat flew over the waves . a few minutes later we encountered the shark 's corpse again , floating .",19
"the silken hair , too , had been suffered to grow all unheeded , and as , in its wild gossamer texture , it floated rather than fell about the face , i could not , even with effort , connect its arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity .",24
""" and weep over a faithless florizel , "" said lord henry , laughing , as he leaned back in his chair .

"pencroft was radiant with joy , the operation was perfectly successful ; the boat completely rigged , having been pushed on rollers to the water 's edge , was floated by the rising tide , amid the cheers of the colonists , particularly of pencroft , who showed no modesty on this occasion .",29
"i share maury 's view , and i was able to study the phenomenon in this exclusive setting where ships rarely go . above us , huddled among the brown weeds , there floated objects originating from all over : tree trunks ripped from the rocky mountains or the andes and sent floating down the amazon or the mississippi , numerous pieces of wreckage , remnants of keels or undersides , bulwarks staved in and so weighed down with seashells and barnacles , they could n't rise to the surface of the ocean . and the passing years will someday bear out maury 's other view that by collecting in this way over the centuries , these substances will be turned to stone by the action of the waters and will then form inexhaustible coalfields . valuable reserves prepared by farseeing nature for that time when man will have exhausted his mines on the continents .",52

"by next evening , thanks to the industry and skill of our guide , the raft was made . it was ten feet by five ; the planks of surturbrand , braced strongly together with cords , presented an even surface , and when launched this improvised vessel floated easily upon the waves of the liedenbrock sea .",48
"having nothing better to do , i decided to dredge these beautiful , clear waters , which exhibited a profusion of shells , zoophytes , and open - sea plants . besides , it was the last day the nautilus would spend in these waterways , if , tomorrow , it still floated off to the open sea as captain nemo had promised .",52
"about twelve , immense shoals of seaweeds came in sight . i was aware of the great powers of vegetation that characterise these plants , which grow at a depth of twelve thousand feet , reproduce themselves under a pressure of four hundred atmospheres , and sometimes form barriers strong enough to impede the course of a ship . but never , i think , were such seaweeds as those which we saw floating in immense waving lines upon the sea of liedenbrock .",73
""" but , "" observed herbert , "" there 's nothing to prove that this bottle has been floating long in the sea . """,18
"there once more , through the panels opening into these caribbean waters ten meters below the surface of the waves , i found so many fascinating exhibits to describe in my daily notes ! among other zoophytes there were portuguese men - of - war known by the name physalia pelagica , like big , oblong bladders with a pearly sheen , spreading their membranes to the wind , letting their blue tentacles drift like silken threads ; to the eye delightful jellyfish , to the touch actual nettles that ooze a corrosive liquid . among the articulates there were annelid worms one and a half meters long , furnished with a pink proboscis , equipped with 1,700 organs of locomotion , snaking through the waters , and as they went , throwing off every gleam in the solar spectrum . from the fish branch there were manta rays , enormous cartilaginous fish ten feet long and weighing 600 pounds , their pectoral fin triangular , their midback slightly arched , their eyes attached to the edges of the face at the front of the head ; they floated like wreckage from a ship , sometimes fastening onto our windows like opaque shutters . there were american triggerfish for which nature has ground only black and white pigments , feather - shaped gobies that were long and plump with yellow fins and jutting jaws , sixteen - decimeter mackerel with short , sharp teeth , covered with small scales , and related to the albacore species . next came swarms of red mullet corseted in gold stripes from head to tail , their shining fins all aquiver , genuine masterpieces of jewelry , formerly sacred to the goddess diana , much in demand by rich romans , and about which the old saying goes : "" he who catches them does n't eat them ! "" finally , adorned with emerald ribbons and dressed in velvet and silk , golden angelfish passed before our eyes like courtiers in the paintings of veronese ; spurred gilthead stole by with their swift thoracic fins ; thread herring fifteen inches long were wrapped in their phosphorescent glimmers ; gray mullet thrashed the sea with their big fleshy tails ; red salmon seemed to mow the waves with their slicing pectorals ; and silver moonfish , worthy of their name , rose on the horizon of the waters like the whitish reflections of many moons .",188
"it was seven in the morning when mr . fogg , aouda , and passepartout set foot upon the american continent , if this name can be given to the floating quay upon which they disembarked . these quays , rising and falling with the tide , thus facilitate the loading and unloading of vessels . alongside them were clippers of all sizes , steamers of all nationalities , and the steamboats , with several decks rising one above the other , which ply on the sacramento and its tributaries . there were also heaped up the products of a commerce which extends to mexico , chili , peru , brazil , europe , asia , and all the pacific islands .",30
"it was a warm june morning , and the latter day saints were as busy as the bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem . in the fields and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry . down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavily - laden mules , all heading to the west , for the gold fever had broken out in california , and the overland route lay through the city of the elect . there , too , were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands , and trains of tired immigrants , men and horses equally weary of their interminable journey . through all this motley assemblage , threading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider , there galloped lucy ferrier , her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out behind her . she had a commission from her father in the city , and was dashing in as she had done many a time before , with all the fearlessness of youth , thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed . the travel - stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment , and even the unemotional indians , journeying in with their pelties , relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale - faced maiden .",152

"the sea was covered with mutilated corpses . a fearsome explosion could n't have slashed , torn , or shredded these fleshy masses with greater violence . we were floating in the midst of gigantic bodies , bluish on the back , whitish on the belly , and all deformed by enormous protuberances . a few frightened sperm whales were fleeing toward the horizon . the waves were dyed red over an area of several miles , and the nautilus was floating in the middle of a sea of blood .",29

"on march 14 at latitude 55 degrees , i spotted floating ice , plain pale bits of rubble twenty to twenty - five feet long , which formed reefs over which the sea burst into foam . the nautilus stayed on the surface of the ocean . having fished in the arctic seas , ned land was already familiar with the sight of icebergs . conseil and i were marveling at them for the first time .",10
"we had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from the road and wound away across the moor . a steep , boulder - sprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone days been cut into a granite quarry . the face which was turned towards us formed a dark cliff , with ferns and brambles growing in its niches . from over a distant rise there floated a gray plume of smoke .",73
"the farther down south we went , the more these floating islands grew in numbers and prominence . polar birds nested on them by the thousands . these were petrels , cape pigeons , or puffins , and their calls were deafening . mistaking the nautilus for the corpse of a whale , some of them alighted on it and prodded its resonant sheet iron with pecks of their beaks .",10
"guided by his skillful hands , the nautilus passed by all these different masses of ice , which are classified by size and shape with a precision that enraptured conseil : "" icebergs , "" or mountains ; "" ice fields , "" or smooth , limitless tracts ; "" drift ice , "" or floating floes ; "" packs , "" or broken tracts , called "" patches "" when they 're circular and "" streams "" when they form long strips .",55

"it was just at high - water when these people came on shore ; and while they rambled about to see what kind of a place they were in , they had carelessly stayed till the tide was spent , and the water was ebbed considerably away , leaving their boat aground . they had left two men in the boat , who , as i found afterwards , having drunk a little too much brandy , fell asleep ; however , one of them waking a little sooner than the other and finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it , hallooed out for the rest , who were straggling about : upon which they all soon came to the boat : but it was past all their strength to launch her , the boat being very heavy , and the shore on that side being a soft oozy sand , almost like a quicksand . in this condition , like true seamen , who are , perhaps , the least of all mankind given to forethought , they gave it over , and away they strolled about the country again ; and i heard one of them say aloud to another , calling them off from the boat , “ why , let her alone , jack , ca n’t you ? she ’ll float next tide ; ” by which i was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of what countrymen they were .",229
"it was evident that this chest had been thrown overboard from some dismasted vessel driven towards the island , and that , in the hope that it would reach the land , where they might afterwards find it , the passengers had taken the precaution to buoy it up by means of this floating apparatus .",53
"the nets were hauled on board . they were a breed of trawl resembling those used off the normandy coast , huge pouches held half open by a floating pole and a chain laced through the lower meshes . trailing in this way from these iron glove makers , the resulting receptacles scoured the ocean floor and collected every marine exhibit in their path . that day they gathered up some unusual specimens from these fish - filled waterways : anglerfish whose comical movements qualify them for the epithet "" clowns , "" black commerson anglers equipped with their antennas , undulating triggerfish encircled by little red bands , bloated puffers whose venom is extremely insidious , some olive - hued lampreys , snipefish covered with silver scales , cutlass fish whose electrocuting power equals that of the electric eel and the electric ray , scaly featherbacks with brown crosswise bands , greenish codfish , several varieties of goby , etc . ; finally , some fish of larger proportions : a one - meter jack with a prominent head , several fine bonito from the genus scomber decked out in the colors blue and silver , and three magnificent tuna whose high speeds could n't save them from our trawl .",28

"in an hour we had reached the islet . two hours later we had completed a full circle around it . it measured four to five miles in circumference . a narrow channel separated it from a considerable shore , perhaps a continent whose limits we could n't see . the existence of this shore seemed to bear out commander maury 's hypotheses . in essence , this ingenious american has noted that between the south pole and the 60th parallel , the sea is covered with floating ice of dimensions much greater than any found in the north atlantic . from this fact he drew the conclusion that the antarctic circle must contain considerable shores , since icebergs ca n't form on the high seas but only along coastlines . according to his calculations , this frozen mass enclosing the southernmost pole forms a vast ice cap whose width must reach 4,000 kilometers .",87
"but before the sand had swallowed the heavy things which had fallen through the bottom , ayrton and pencroft , diving to the bed of the channel , recovered the chains and anchors of the brig , the iron of her ballast , and even four guns , which , floated by means of empty casks , were brought to shore .",50
