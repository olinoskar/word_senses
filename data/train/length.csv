"striking an average of observations taken at different times-- rejecting those timid estimates that gave the object a length of 200 feet , and ignoring those exaggerated views that saw it as a mile wide and three long -- you could still assert that this phenomenal creature greatly exceeded the dimensions of anything then known to ichthyologists , if it existed at all .",18,"('length', 'longueur', 'longitud')",0
"the iron , prepared previously in long thin rods , the ends of which were sharpened with the file , having been introduced into the largest hole of the drawplate , was drawn out by the beam which wound it round itself , to a length of twenty - five or thirty feet , then unrolled , and the same operation was performed successively through the holes of a less size .",45,"('length', 'longueur', 'longitud')",0
"this accident happened around five o'clock in the morning , just as day was beginning to break . the officers on watch rushed to the craft 's stern . they examined the ocean with the most scrupulous care . they saw nothing except a strong eddy breaking three cable lengths out , as if those sheets of water had been violently churned . the site 's exact bearings were taken , and the moravian continued on course apparently undamaged . had it run afoul of an underwater rock or the wreckage of some enormous derelict ship ? they were unable to say . but when they examined its undersides in the service yard , they discovered that part of its keel had been smashed .",49,"('length', 'encablure', 'cable')",1
""" the common narwhale , or sea unicorn , often reaches a length of sixty feet . increase its dimensions fivefold or even tenfold , then give this cetacean a strength in proportion to its size while enlarging its offensive weapons , and you have the animal we 're looking for . it would have the proportions determined by the officers of the shannon , the instrument needed to perforate the scotia , and the power to pierce a steamer 's hull .",12,"('length', 'longueur', 'longitud')",0

"those piles of stones just mentioned were laid out on the ocean floor with a distinct but inexplicable symmetry . i spotted gigantic furrows trailing off into the distant darkness , their length incalculable . there also were other peculiarities i could n't make sense of . it seemed to me that my heavy lead soles were crushing a litter of bones that made a dry crackling noise . so what were these vast plains we were now crossing ? i wanted to ask the captain , but i still did n't grasp that sign language that allowed him to chat with his companions when they went with him on his underwater excursions .",32,"('length', 'longueur', 'longitud')",0

"we were in reality shut up inside an immeasurable excavation . its width could not be estimated , since the shore ran widening as far as eye could reach , nor could its length , for the dim horizon bounded the new . as for its height , it must have been several leagues . where this vault rested upon its granite base no eye could tell ; but there was a cloud hanging far above , the height of which we estimated at 12,000 feet , a greater height than that of any terrestrial vapour , and no doubt due to the great density of the air .",33,"('length', 'longueur', 'longitud')",0
""" here , professor aronnax , are the different dimensions of this boat now transporting you . it 's a very long cylinder with conical ends . it noticeably takes the shape of a cigar , a shape already adopted in london for several projects of the same kind . the length of this cylinder from end to end is exactly seventy meters , and its maximum breadth of beam is eight meters . so it is n't quite built on the ten - to - one ratio of your high - speed steamers ; but its lines are sufficiently long , and their tapering gradual enough , so that the displaced water easily slips past and poses no obstacle to the ship 's movements .",51,"('length', 'longueur', 'longitud')",0

"two cable lengths off the abraham lincoln 's starboard quarter , the sea seemed to be lit up from underneath . this was no mere phosphorescent phenomenon , that much was unmistakable . submerged some fathoms below the surface of the water , the monster gave off that very intense but inexplicable glow that several captains had mentioned in their reports . this magnificent radiance had to come from some force with a great illuminating capacity . the edge of its light swept over the sea in an immense , highly elongated oval , condensing at the center into a blazing core whose unbearable glow diminished by degrees outward .",2,"('length', 'encablure', 'cable')",1

"arriving within a few cable lengths of the cetacean , our longboat slowed down , and the sculls dipped noiselessly into the tranquil waters . harpoon in hand , ned land went to take his stand in the skiff 's bow . harpoons used for hunting whales are usually attached to a very long rope that pays out quickly when the wounded animal drags it with him . but this rope measured no more than about ten fathoms , and its end had simply been fastened to a small barrel that , while floating , would indicate the dugong 's movements beneath the waters .",5,"('length', 'encablure', 'cable')",1

"meanwhile i was carefully examining these unleashed breakers . they measured up to fifteen meters in height over a length of 150 to 175 meters , and the speed of their propagation ( half that of the wind ) was fifteen meters per second . their volume and power increased with the depth of the waters . i then understood the role played by these waves , which trap air in their flanks and release it in the depths of the sea where its oxygen brings life . their utmost pressure -- it has been calculated-- can build to 3,000 kilograms on every square foot of surface they strike . it was such waves in the hebrides that repositioned a stone block weighing 84,000 pounds . it was their relatives in the tidal wave on december 23 , 1854 , that toppled part of the japanese city of tokyo , then went that same day at 700 kilometers per hour to break on the beaches of america .",19,"('length', 'longueur', 'longitud')",0

"while cruising along only a few cable lengths from the underpinning of reao island , i marveled at the gigantic piece of work accomplished by these microscopic laborers . these walls were the express achievements of madrepores known by the names fire coral , finger coral , star coral , and stony coral . these polyps grow exclusively in the agitated strata at the surface of the sea , and so it 's in the upper reaches that they begin these substructures , which sink little by little together with the secreted rubble binding them . this , at least , is the theory of mr . charles darwin , who thus explains the formation of atolls -- a theory superior , in my view , to the one that says these madreporic edifices sit on the summits of mountains or volcanoes submerged a few feet below sea level .",7,"('length', 'encablure', 'cable')",1
