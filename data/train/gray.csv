"as midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air , dorian gray , dressed commonly , and with a muffler wrapped round his throat , crept quietly out of his house . in bond street he found a hansom with a good horse . he hailed it and in a low voice gave the driver an address .",12,"('gray', 'gray', 'gray')",0

"lying back in the hansom , with his hat pulled over his forehead , dorian gray watched with listless eyes the sordid shame of the great city , and now and then he repeated to himself the words that lord henry had said to him on the first day they had met , "" to cure the soul by means of the senses , and the senses by means of the soul . "" yes , that was the secret . he had often tried it , and would try it again now . there were opium dens where one could buy oblivion , dens of horror where the memory of old sins could be destroyed by the madness of sins that were new .",15,"('gray', 'gray', 'gray')",0

"dorian gray hurried along the quay through the drizzling rain . his meeting with adrian singleton had strangely moved him , and he wondered if the ruin of that young life was really to be laid at his door , as basil hallward had said to him with such infamy of insult . he bit his lip , and for a few seconds his eyes grew sad . yet , after all , what did it matter to him ? one 's days were too brief to take the burden of another 's errors on one 's shoulders . each man lived his own life and paid his own price for living it . the only pity was one had to pay so often for a single fault . one had to pay over and over again , indeed . in her dealings with man , destiny never closed her accounts .",1,"('gray', 'gray', 'gray')",0
