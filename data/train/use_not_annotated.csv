"my first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this moor , to get something for our subsistence on board ; for i told him we must not presume to eat of our patron ’s bread . he said that was true ; so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit , and three jars of fresh water , into the boat . i knew where my patron ’s case of bottles stood , which it was evident , by the make , were taken out of some english prize , and i conveyed them into the boat while the moor was on shore , as if they had been there before for our master . i conveyed also a great lump of beeswax into the boat , which weighed about half a hundred - weight , with a parcel of twine or thread , a hatchet , a saw , and a hammer , all of which were of great use to us afterwards , especially the wax , to make candles . another trick i tried upon him , which he innocently came into also : his name was ismael , which they call muley , or moely ; so i called to him—“moely , ” said i , “ our patron ’s guns are on board the boat ; can you not get a little powder and shot ? it may be we may kill some alcamies ( a fowl like our curlews ) for ourselves , for i know he keeps the gunner ’s stores in the ship . ” “ yes , ” says he , “ i ’ll bring some ; ” and accordingly he brought a great leather pouch , which held a pound and a half of powder , or rather more ; and another with shot , that had five or six pounds , with some bullets , and put all into the boat . at the same time i had found some powder of my master ’s in the great cabin , with which i filled one of the large bottles in the case , which was almost empty , pouring what was in it into another ; and thus furnished with everything needful , we sailed out of the port to fish . the castle , which is at the entrance of the port , knew who we were , and took no notice of us ; and we were not above a mile out of the port before we hauled in our sail and set us down to fish . the wind blew from the n.n.e . , which was contrary to my desire , for had it blown southerly i had been sure to have made the coast of spain , and at least reached to the bay of cadiz ; but my resolutions were , blow which way it would , i would be gone from that horrid place where i was , and leave the rest to fate .",165
"by the best of my calculation , that place where i now was must be that country which , lying between the emperor of morocco ’s dominions and the negroes , lies waste and uninhabited , except by wild beasts ; the negroes having abandoned it and gone farther south for fear of the moors , and the moors not thinking it worth inhabiting by reason of its barrenness ; and indeed , both forsaking it because of the prodigious number of tigers , lions , leopards , and other furious creatures which harbour there ; so that the moors use it for their hunting only , where they go like an army , two or three thousand men at a time ; and indeed for near a hundred miles together upon this coast we saw nothing but a waste , uninhabited country by day , and heard nothing but howlings and roaring of wild beasts by night .",100
"but , alas ! for me to do wrong that never did right , was no great wonder . i hail no remedy but to go on : i had got into an employment quite remote to my genius , and directly contrary to the life i delighted in , and for which i forsook my father ’s house , and broke through all his good advice . nay , i was coming into the very middle station , or upper degree of low life , which my father advised me to before , and which , if i resolved to go on with , i might as well have stayed at home , and never have fatigued myself in the world as i had done ; and i used often to say to myself , i could have done this as well in england , among my friends , as have gone five thousand miles off to do it among strangers and savages , in a wilderness , and at such a distance as never to hear from any part of the world that had the least knowledge of me .",129
"in this manner i used to look upon my condition with the utmost regret . i had nobody to converse with , but now and then this neighbour ; no work to be done , but by the labour of my hands ; and i used to say , i lived just like a man cast away upon some desolate island , that had nobody there but himself . but how just has it been — and how should all men reflect , that when they compare their present conditions with others that are worse , heaven may oblige them to make the exchange , and be convinced of their former felicity by their experience — i say , how just has it been , that the truly solitary life i reflected on , in an island of mere desolation , should be my lot , who had so often unjustly compared it with the life which i then led , in which , had i continued , i had in all probability been exceeding prosperous and rich .",4

"i had three encouragements—1st , a smooth , calm sea ; 2ndly , the tide rising , and setting in to the shore ; 3rdly , what little wind there was blew me towards the land . and thus , having found two or three broken oars belonging to the boat — and , besides the tools which were in the chest , i found two saws , an axe , and a hammer ; with this cargo i put to sea . for a mile or thereabouts my raft went very well , only that i found it drive a little distant from the place where i had landed before ; by which i perceived that there was some indraft of the water , and consequently i hoped to find some creek or river there , which i might make use of as a port to get to land with my cargo .",141

"it had been used , apparently , in remote feudal times , for the worst purposes of a donjon - keep , and , in later days , as a place of deposit for powder , or some other highly combustible substance , as a portion of its floor , and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it , were carefully sheathed with copper .",3

"just then the chief officer drew the captain 's attention anew . the latter interrupted his strolling and aimed his spyglass at the point indicated . he observed it a good while . as for me , deeply puzzled , i went below to the lounge and brought back an excellent long - range telescope i habitually used . leaning my elbows on the beacon housing , which jutted from the stern of the platform , i got set to scour that whole stretch of sky and sea . but no sooner had i peered into the eyepiece than the instrument was snatched from my hands .",57
"and if nothing happens without his knowledge , he knows that i am here , and am in this dreadful condition ; and if nothing happens without his appointment , he has appointed all this to befall me . nothing occurred to my thought to contradict any of these conclusions , and therefore it rested upon me with the greater force , that it must needs be that god had appointed all this to befall me ; that i was brought into this miserable circumstance by his direction , he having the sole power , not of me only , but of everything that happened in the world . immediately it followed : why has god done this to me ? what have i done to be thus used ? my conscience presently checked me in that inquiry , as if i had blasphemed , and methought it spoke to me like a voice : “ wretch ! dost _ thou _ ask what thou hast done ? look back upon a dreadful misspent life , and ask thyself what thou hast _ not _ done ? ask , why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed ? why wert thou not drowned in yarmouth roads ; killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the sallee man - of - war ; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of africa ; or drowned _ here _ , when all the crew perished but thyself ? dost _ thou _ ask , what have i done ? ” i was struck dumb with these reflections , as one astonished , and had not a word to say — no , not to answer to myself , but rose up pensive and sad , walked back to my retreat , and went up over my wall , as if i had been going to bed ; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed , and i had no inclination to sleep ; so i sat down in my chair , and lighted my lamp , for it began to be dark . now , as the apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me very much , it occurred to my thought that the brazilians take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers , and i had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests , which was quite cured , and some also that was green , and not quite cured .",128
"another reflection was of great use to me , and doubtless would be so to any one that should fall into such distress as mine was ; and this was , to compare my present condition with what i at first expected it would be ; nay , with what it would certainly have been , if the good providence of god had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up nearer to the shore , where i not only could come at her , but could bring what i got out of her to the shore , for my relief and comfort ; without which , i had wanted for tools to work , weapons for defence , and gunpowder and shot for getting my food .",5
"alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank , and of having nothing to do : once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading , but it had no pictures or conversations in it , ' and what is the use of a book , ' thought alice ' without pictures or conversation ? '",52
"besides this , i arrived at an unexpected perfection in my earthenware , and contrived well enough to make them with a wheel , which i found infinitely easier and better ; because i made things round and shaped , which before were filthy things indeed to look on . but i think i was never more vain of my own performance , or more joyful for anything i found out , than for my being able to make a tobacco - pipe ; and though it was a very ugly , clumsy thing when it was done , and only burned red , like other earthenware , yet as it was hard and firm , and would draw the smoke , i was exceedingly comforted with it , for i had been always used to smoke ; and there were pipes in the ship , but i forgot them at first , not thinking there was tobacco in the island ; and afterwards , when i searched the ship again , i could not come at any pipes .",134
"alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage , not much larger than a rat - hole : she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw . how she longed to get out of that dark hall , and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains , but she could not even get her head though the doorway ; ' and even if my head would go through , ' thought poor alice , ' it would be of very little use without my shoulders . oh , how i wish i could shut up like a telescope ! i think i could , if i only know how to begin .

"arriving within a few cable lengths of the cetacean , our longboat slowed down , and the sculls dipped noiselessly into the tranquil waters . harpoon in hand , ned land went to take his stand in the skiff 's bow . harpoons used for hunting whales are usually attached to a very long rope that pays out quickly when the wounded animal drags it with him . but this rope measured no more than about ten fathoms , and its end had simply been fastened to a small barrel that , while floating , would indicate the dugong 's movements beneath the waters .",43
"the ladders , which were formerly used for the ascent , were brought to the chimneys and buried deep in the sand , so that they might be available on the return of the colonists , for the machinery of the lift had been taken to pieces , and nothing of the apparatus remained .",6

"the baron pretended that he had been worse used than myself ; and i insisted that there was far less harm in taking up a nosegay , and putting it into a woman 's bosom , than to be found stark naked with a young icoglan . we were continually whipped , and received twenty lashes a day with a heavy thong , when the concatenation of sublunary events brought you on board our galley to ransom us from slavery .

"one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked . this of course , alice could not stand , and she went round the court and got behind him , and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away . she did it so quickly that the poor little juror ( it was bill , the lizard ) could not make out at all what had become of it ; so , after hunting all about for it , he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day ; and this was of very little use , as it left no mark on the slate .",101

"there was none , down to brother giroflee , but did some service ; he was a very good carpenter , and became an honest man . pangloss used now and then to say to candide : "" there is a concatenation of all events in the best of possible worlds ; for , in short , had you not been kicked out of a fine castle for the love of miss cunegund ; had you not been put into the inquisition ; had you not traveled over america on foot ; had you not run the baron through the body ; and had you not lost all your sheep , which you brought from the good country of el dorado , you would not have been here to eat preserved citrons and pistachio nuts .

"neither the weapons nor the instruments , contrary to the usual custom , bore the name of the maker ; they were , besides , in a perfect state , and did not appear to have been used .",37
"alice looked at the jury - box , and saw that , in her haste , she had put the lizard in head downwards , and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way , being quite unable to move . she soon got it out again , and put it right ; ' not that it signifies much , ' she said to herself ; ' i should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other .

"accordingly , our speed was twenty - five miles ( that is , twelve four - kilometer leagues ) per hour . needless to say , ned land had to give up his escape plans , much to his distress . swept along at the rate of twelve to thirteen meters per second , he could hardly make use of the skiff . leaving the nautilus under these conditions would have been like jumping off a train racing at this speed , a rash move if there ever was one . moreover , to renew our air supply , the submersible rose to the surface of the waves only at night , and relying solely on compass and log , it steered by dead reckoning .",58
