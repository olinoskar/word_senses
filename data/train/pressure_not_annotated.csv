"the captain said a few words to his chief officer who went out immediately . soon the nautilus reentered its liquid element , and the pressure gauge indicated that it was staying at a depth of thirty feet .",25
lost at an immeasurable depth ! thirty leagues of rock seemed to weigh upon my shoulders with a dreadful pressure . i felt crushed .,19
"there my eyes fell on the compass . our heading was still northerly . the log indicated a moderate speed , the pressure gauge a depth of about sixty feet . so circumstances were in favor of the canadian 's plans .",22
""" it 's easy to find out , "" i answered . i consulted the pressure gauge . much to my surprise , it indicated a depth of 360 meters .",15
"we had been left to ourselves for twenty minutes , trying to detect the tiniest noises inside the nautilus , when captain nemo entered . he did n't seem to see us . his facial features , usually so emotionless , revealed a certain uneasiness . he studied the compass and pressure gauge in silence , then went and put his finger on the world map at a spot in the sector depicting the southernmost seas .",51
""" that , sir , is being done right now . you can hear the pumps working . look at the needle on the pressure gauge . it indicates that the nautilus is rising , but this block of ice is rising with us , and until some obstacle halts its upward movement , our position wo n't change . """,24
"for caresses , too , i now got grimaces ; for a pressure of the hand , a pinch on the arm ; for a kiss on the cheek , a severe tweak of the ear . it was all right : at present i decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything more tender .",12
"i mused on all the consequences of this situation . captain nemo did n't stop studying the pressure gauge . since the toppling of this iceberg , the nautilus had risen about 150 feet , but it still stayed at the same angle to the perpendicular .",17
""" these are the normal navigational instruments , "" i replied , "" and i 'm familiar with their uses . but no doubt these others answer pressing needs unique to the nautilus . that dial i see there , with the needle moving across it -- isn't it a pressure gauge ? """,50
""" it is indeed a pressure gauge . it 's placed in contact with the water , and it indicates the outside pressure on our hull , which in turn gives me the depth at which my submersible is sitting . """,5
""" are we up to pressure ? "" he asked the man .",5
"the hours passed . i often studied the instruments hanging on the lounge wall . the pressure gauge indicated that the nautilus stayed at a constant depth of 300 meters , the compass that it kept heading south , the log that it was traveling at a speed of twenty miles per hour , an excessive speed in such a cramped area . but captain nemo knew that by this point there was no such thing as too fast , since minutes were now worth centuries .",16
""" oh , i could produce the air needed on board , but it would be pointless , since i can rise to the surface of the sea whenever i like . however , even though electricity does n't supply me with breathable air , it at least operates the powerful pumps that store it under pressure in special tanks ; which , if need be , allows me to extend my stay in the lower strata for as long as i want . """,56
""" yes , and since the atmosphere 's pressure actually weighs slightly more than one kilogram per square centimeter , your 17,000 square centimeters are tolerating 17,568 kilograms at this very moment . """,8
""" without your noticing it . and if you are n't crushed by so much pressure , it 's because the air penetrates the interior of your body with equal pressure . when the inside and outside pressures are in perfect balance , they neutralize each other and allow you to tolerate them without discomfort . but in the water it 's another story . """,37
"this stream of electricity dazzled my eyes , and after momentarily shutting them , i looked around . the nautilus was stationary . it was floating next to an embankment shaped like a wharf . as for the water now buoying the ship , it was a lake completely encircled by an inner wall about two miles in diameter , hence six miles around . its level -- as indicated by the pressure gauge -- would be the same as the outside level , because some connection had to exist between this lake and the sea . slanting inward over their base , these high walls converged to form a vault shaped like an immense upside - down funnel that measured 500 or 600 meters in height . at its summit there gaped the circular opening through which i had detected that faint glimmer , obviously daylight .",72
""" yes , captain , maybe so . but whatever resistance to crushing the nautilus may have , it still could n't stand such dreadful pressures , and it would be squashed as flat as a piece of sheet iron . """,25
""" in order to steer this boat to port or starboard , in short , to make turns on a horizontal plane , i use an ordinary , wide - bladed rudder that 's fastened to the rear of the sternpost and worked by a wheel and tackle . but i can also move the nautilus upward and downward on a vertical plane by the simple method of slanting its two fins , which are attached to its sides at its center of flotation ; these fins are flexible , able to assume any position , and can be operated from inside by means of powerful levers . if these fins stay parallel with the boat , the latter moves horizontally . if they slant , the nautilus follows the angle of that slant and , under its propeller 's thrust , either sinks on a diagonal as steep as it suits me , or rises on that diagonal . and similarly , if i want to return more swiftly to the surface , i throw the propeller in gear , and the water 's pressure makes the nautilus rise vertically , as an air balloon inflated with hydrogen lifts swiftly into the skies . """,185
"towards morning the ascending movement became accelerated . if the heat increased , instead of diminishing , as we approached nearer to the surface of the globe , this effect was due to local causes alone , and those volcanic . the manner of our locomotion left no doubt in my mind . an enormous force , a force of hundreds of atmospheres , generated by the extreme pressure of confined vapours , was driving us irresistibly forward . but to what numberless dangers it exposed us !",68
"our full electric power was then put on the pumps , which instantly began to expel water from the ballast tanks . after a few minutes we had checked our fall . the pressure gauge soon indicated an ascending movement . brought to full speed , the propeller made the sheet - iron hull tremble down to its rivets , and we sped northward .",33
just then the pressure gauge indicated we were no more than twenty feet from the surface . separating us from the open air was a mere tract of ice . could we break through it ?,3
"the captain pressed an electric bell three times . the pumps began to expel water from the ballast tanks ; on the pressure gauge , a needle marked the decreasing pressures that indicated the nautilus 's upward progress ; then the needle stopped .",22
"under this powerful thrust the nautilus 's hull quivered like a resonating chord , and the ship sank steadily under the waters . stationed in the lounge , the captain and i watched the needle swerving swiftly over the pressure gauge . soon we had gone below the livable zone where most fish reside . some of these animals can thrive only at the surface of seas or rivers , but a minority can dwell at fairly great depths . among the latter i observed a species of dogfish called the cow shark that 's equipped with six respiratory slits , the telescope fish with its enormous eyes , the armored gurnard with gray thoracic fins plus black pectoral fins and a breastplate protected by pale red slabs of bone , then finally the grenadier , living at a depth of 1,200 meters , by that point tolerating a pressure of 120 atmospheres .",39

"my eyes flew back to the pressure gauge . the instrument indicated a depth of 6,000 meters . our submergence had been going on for an hour . the nautilus slid downward on its slanting fins , still sinking . these deserted waters were wonderfully clear , with a transparency impossible to convey . an hour later we were at 13,000 meters-- about three and a quarter vertical leagues -- and the ocean floor was nowhere in sight .",6
"despite the powerful pressures it was undergoing , the nautilus sank still deeper . i could feel its sheet - iron plates trembling down to their riveted joins ; metal bars arched ; bulkheads groaned ; the lounge windows seemed to be warping inward under the water 's pressure . and this whole sturdy mechanism would surely have given way , if , as its captain had said , it were n't capable of resisting like a solid block .",3
"the crew were waiting impatiently for orders from their leader . the latter , after carefully observing the animal , called for his engineer . the engineer raced over . "" sir , "" the commander said , "" are you up to pressure ? """,43
"the engineer did so . the pressure gauge marked ten atmospheres . but no doubt the cetacean itself had "" warmed up , "" because without the least trouble , it also did 19.3 .",6
"suddenly daylight appeared in the lounge . the sheet - iron panels slid shut . the magical vision disappeared . but for a good while i kept dreaming away , until the moment my eyes focused on the instruments hanging on the wall . the compass still showed our heading as east - northeast , the pressure gauge indicated a pressure of five atmospheres ( corresponding to a depth of fifty meters ) , and the electric log gave our speed as fifteen miles per hour .",56
""" that does n't necessarily follow . there are certain fulton - style guns perfected by the englishmen philippe - coles and burley , the frenchman furcy , and the italian landi ; they 're equipped with a special system of airtight fastenings and can fire in underwater conditions . but i repeat : having no gunpowder , i 've replaced it with air at high pressure , which is abundantly supplied me by the nautilus 's pumps . """,66
"here a question popped into my head . how did the commander of this aquatic residence go about it ? did he obtain air using chemical methods , releasing the oxygen contained in potassium chlorate by heating it , meanwhile absorbing the carbon dioxide with potassium hydroxide ? if so , he would have to keep up some kind of relationship with the shore , to come by the materials needed for such an operation . did he simply limit himself to storing the air in high - pressure tanks and then dispense it according to his crew 's needs ? perhaps . or , proceeding in a more convenient , more economical , and consequently more probable fashion , was he satisfied with merely returning to breathe at the surface of the water like a cetacean , renewing his oxygen supply every twenty - four hours ? in any event , whatever his method was , it seemed prudent to me that he use this method without delay .",88
i took a seat in the lounge with conseil . through the open window we stared at the lower strata of this southernmost ocean . the thermometer rose again . the needle on the pressure gauge swerved over its dial .,34
"and indeed he proposed to make use of the property which the filaments of wool possess when subjected to a powerful pressure of mixing together , and of manufacturing by this simple process the material called felt .",21
"my eyes did n't leave the pressure gauge . we kept rising on a diagonal , going along this shiny surface that sparkled beneath our electric rays . above and below , the ice bank was subsiding in long gradients . mile after mile it was growing thinner .",6
