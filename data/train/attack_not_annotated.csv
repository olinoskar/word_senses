cyrus harding now imparted to his companions a scheme for completely isolating prospect heights so as to shelter it from the attacks both of quadrupeds and quadrumana .,21
"these were the only words he uttered during the journey . aouda , cosily packed in furs and cloaks , was sheltered as much as possible from the attacks of the freezing wind . as for passepartout , his face was as red as the sun 's disc when it sets in the mist , and he laboriously inhaled the biting air . with his natural buoyancy of spirits , he began to hope again . they would reach new york on the evening , if not on the morning , of the 11th , and there was still some chances that it would be before the steamer sailed for liverpool .",28

"work began immediately and was carried on with tireless tenacity . instead of digging all around the nautilus , which would have entailed even greater difficulties , captain nemo had an immense trench outlined on the ice , eight meters from our port quarter . then his men simultaneously staked it off at several points around its circumference . soon their picks were vigorously attacking this compact matter , and huge chunks were loosened from its mass . these chunks weighed less than the water , and by an unusual effect of specific gravity , each chunk took wing , as it were , to the roof of the tunnel , which thickened above by as much as it diminished below . but this hardly mattered so long as the lower surface kept growing thinner .",64
