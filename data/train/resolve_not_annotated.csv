"yet such was the fright i had taken of the moors , and the dreadful apprehensions i had of falling into their hands , that i would not stop , or go on shore , or come to an anchor ; the wind continuing fair till i had sailed in that manner five days ; and then the wind shifting to the southward , i concluded also that if any of our vessels were in chase of me , they also would now give over ; so i ventured to make to the coast , and came to an anchor in the mouth of a little river , i knew not what , nor where , neither what latitude , what country , what nation , or what river . i neither saw , nor desired to see any people ; the principal thing i wanted was fresh water . we came into this creek in the evening , resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark , and discover the country ; but as soon as it was quite dark , we heard such dreadful noises of the barking , roaring , and howling of wild creatures , of we knew not what kinds , that the poor boy was ready to die with fear , and begged of me not to go on shore till day .",159
