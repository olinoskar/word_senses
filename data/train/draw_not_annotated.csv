"the iron , prepared previously in long thin rods , the ends of which were sharpened with the file , having been introduced into the largest hole of the drawplate , was drawn out by the beam which wound it round itself , to a length of twenty - five or thirty feet , then unrolled , and the same operation was performed successively through the holes of a less size .",32
"on april 13 , 1867 , with a smooth sea and a moderate breeze , the scotia lay in longitude 15 degrees 12 ' and latitude 45 degrees 37 ' . it was traveling at a speed of 13.43 knots under the thrust of its 1,000-horsepower engines . its paddle wheels were churning the sea with perfect steadiness . it was then drawing 6.7 meters of water and displacing 6,624 cubic meters .",62

"at the moment he went out a piercing glance darted through the opening of the nearly closed door , and she perceived felton , who drew quickly to one side to prevent being seen by her .",25
"the two young men bowed and separated , aramis ascending the street which led to the luxembourg , while d’artagnan , perceiving the appointed hour was approaching , took the road to the carmes - deschaux , saying to himself , "" decidedly i ca n’t draw back ; but at least , if i am killed , i shall be killed by a musketeer .

""" nothing , "" said he , throwing it down . "" it is a blank half - sheet of paper , without even a water - mark upon it . i think we have drawn as much as we can from this curious letter ; and now , sir henry , has anything else of interest happened to you since you have been in london ? """,35
"here is the exact facsimile . i think it important to let these strange signs be publicly known , for they were the means of drawing on professor liedenbrock and his nephew to undertake the most wonderful expedition of the nineteenth century .",25
"the lad started and drew back . he was bareheaded , and the leaves had tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads . there was a look of fear in his eyes , such as people have when they are suddenly awakened . his finely chiselled nostrils quivered , and some hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling .",4

"then , with the intention quite patent of not drawing back a foot from the accomplishment of the commission with which he was charged , and as the attendant of an executioner might have done in the chamber of torture , he approached anne of austria , for whose eyes at the same instant sprang tears of rage .",9
"i lingered ; the moon shut herself wholly within her chamber , and drew close her curtain of dense cloud : the night grew dark ; rain came driving fast on the gale .",13
"then as the steps drew near , she became silent for fear of being heard , applying , with a gesture of infinite terror , her beautiful hand to felton ’s mouth .",4
"this idea , while darkening his brow , drew several sighs from him , and caused him to formulate to himself a few vows of vengeance .",8

"she felt by intuition the flame of the opposing passions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young fanatic . as a skillful general , seeing the enemy ready to surrender , marches toward him with a cry of victory , she rose , beautiful as an antique priestess , inspired like a christian virgin , her arms extended , her throat uncovered , her hair disheveled , holding with one hand her robe modestly drawn over her breast , her look illumined by that fire which had already created such disorder in the veins of the young puritan , and went toward him , crying out with a vehement air , and in her melodious voice , to which on this occasion she communicated a terrible energy :",78

"you are a christian ; you are my sister in religion . i feel myself drawn toward you -- i , who have never loved anyone but my benefactor -- i who have met with nothing but traitors and impious men .",15

"there was a moment of silence ; but at length the two englishmen felt ashamed to draw back , and the angrier one descended the five or six steps which led to the cellar , and gave a kick against the door enough to split a wall .",16
"our frigate drew nearer to the cetacean . i examined it with a completely open mind . those reports from the shannon and the helvetia had slightly exaggerated its dimensions , and i put its length at only 250 feet . its girth was more difficult to judge , but all in all , the animal seemed to be wonderfully proportioned in all three dimensions .",2
"the gentlemen had drawn their swords , but they found themselves taken between two fires . they still hesitated an instant ; but , as before , pride prevailed , and a second kick split the door from bottom to top .",3
"i would draw your attention also to an entirely physical cause , which renders the southern colder than the northern hemisphere .",2
"unhappily for his master , as well as himself , his curiosity drew him unconsciously farther off than he intended to go . at last , having seen the parsee carnival wind away in the distance , he was turning his steps towards the station , when he happened to espy the splendid pagoda on malabar hill , and was seized with an irresistible desire to see its interior . he was quite ignorant that it is forbidden to christians to enter certain indian temples , and that even the faithful must not go in without first leaving their shoes outside the door . it may be said here that the wise policy of the british government severely punishes a disregard of the practices of the native religions .",12
"d’artagnan threw himself on his neck and embraced him tenderly . he then tried to draw him from his moist abode , but to his surprise he perceived that athos staggered .",15
"then , through the grating to which she had drawn near , milady saw the young man make a sign with delirious fervor , and depart in an apparent transport of joy .",9
"it was but too true that the railway came to a termination at this point . the papers were like some watches , which have a way of getting too fast , and had been premature in their announcement of the completion of the line . the greater part of the travellers were aware of this interruption , and , leaving the train , they began to engage such vehicles as the village could provide four - wheeled palkigharis , waggons drawn by zebus , carriages that looked like perambulating pagodas , palanquins , ponies , and what not . mr . fogg and sir francis cromarty , after searching the village from end to end , came back without having found anything .",81
""" then what conclusion may be drawn ? "" asked the reporter .",6
""" yes ; but that abduction had for its object the betrayal of my mistress , to draw from me by torture confessions that might compromise the honor , and perhaps the life , of my august mistress . """,17

"its strange form caught the eye , and when gideon spilett , on the engineer 's advice , had drawn the outline , they found that it resembled some fantastic animal , a monstrous leviathan , which lay sleeping on the surface of the pacific .",19
"this was in fact the exact shape of the island , which it is of consequence to know , and a tolerably correct map of it was immediately drawn by the reporter .",28
"i drew aside my curtains before i went to bed and looked out from my window . it opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of the hall door . beyond , two copses of trees moaned and swung in a rising wind . a half moon broke through the rifts of racing clouds . in its cold light i saw beyond the trees a broken fringe of rocks , and the long , low curve of the melancholy moor . i closed the curtain , feeling that my last impression was in keeping with the rest .",1
"was i resigned ? no , not yet . yet the cool morning air and the scenes on the road , rapidly changed by the swiftness of the train , drew me away somewhat from my sad reflections .",30

"i made some attempts to draw her into conversation , but she seemed a person of few words : a monosyllabic reply usually cut short every effort of that sort .",5
"the traveller now , stooping , felt his foot and leg , as if trying whether they were sound ; apparently something ailed them , for he halted to the stile whence i had just risen , and sat down . i was in the mood for being useful , or at least officious , i think , for i now drew near him again .",61
"himself has hitherto sufficed to the toil , and the toil draws near its close : his glorious sun hastens to its setting .",11

""" no ; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out , though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him . """,13
"mr . fogg , aouda , and passepartout were conducted to a palkigahri , a sort of four - wheeled carriage , drawn by two horses , in which they took their places and were driven away . no one spoke during the twenty minutes which elapsed before they reached their destination . they first passed through the "" black town , "" with its narrow streets , its miserable , dirty huts , and squalid population ; then through the "" european town , "" which presented a relief in its bright brick mansions , shaded by coconut - trees and bristling with masts , where , although it was early morning , elegantly dressed horsemen and handsome equipages were passing back and forth .",22
"now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder , but i would not permit it . then he would draw me to him : no .",23
"d’artagnan drew back the bolt with precaution , and both , light as shadows , glided through the interior door into the passage , ascended the stairs as quietly as possible , and entered d’artagnan ’s chambers .",1
"at sight of this man , d’artagnan started , and half drawing his sword , sprang toward the door .",11
"i drew near , and found he was bidding a hundred pistoles for a chestnut nag . ’ pardieu , ’ said i , ’ my good gentleman , i have a horse to sell , too . ’ ’ ay , and a very fine one !",1
"i was on the point of asking him what that work might be , but something in his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one . i pondered over our short conversation , however , and endeavoured to draw my deductions from it . he said that he would acquire no knowledge which did not bear upon his object . therefore all the knowledge which he possessed was such as would be useful to him . i enumerated in my own mind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was exceptionally well - informed . i even took a pencil and jotted them down . i could not help smiling at the document when i had completed it . it ran in this way —",42
"in an hour we had reached the islet . two hours later we had completed a full circle around it . it measured four to five miles in circumference . a narrow channel separated it from a considerable shore , perhaps a continent whose limits we could n't see . the existence of this shore seemed to bear out commander maury 's hypotheses . in essence , this ingenious american has noted that between the south pole and the 60th parallel , the sea is covered with floating ice of dimensions much greater than any found in the north atlantic . from this fact he drew the conclusion that the antarctic circle must contain considerable shores , since icebergs ca n't form on the high seas but only along coastlines . according to his calculations , this frozen mass enclosing the southernmost pole forms a vast ice cap whose width must reach 4,000 kilometers .",105
"what was detective fix , so unluckily drawn on from country to country , doing all this while ? he had managed to embark on the rangoon at calcutta without being seen by passepartout , after leaving orders that , if the warrant should arrive , it should be forwarded to him at hong kong ; and he hoped to conceal his presence to the end of the voyage . it would have been difficult to explain why he was on board without awakening passepartout 's suspicions , who thought him still at bombay . but necessity impelled him , nevertheless , to renew his acquaintance with the worthy servant , as will be seen .",7
"i drew conseil 's attention to the considerable growth of the cerebral lobes found in these intelligent cetaceans . no mammal except man has more abundant cerebral matter . accordingly , seals are quite capable of being educated ; they make good pets , and together with certain other naturalists , i think these animals can be properly trained to perform yeoman service as hunting dogs for fishermen .",1
""" except that ! "" my friend answered , pointing at the pathway . "" if a herd of buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess . no doubt , however , you had drawn your own conclusions , gregson , before you permitted this . """,38

""" he appears young , and will be easy to educate , and we shall not be obliged to use force to subdue him , nor draw his teeth , as is sometimes done .",26
"the host gave them another chamber , and served them with fresh eggs and some water , which athos went himself to draw at the fountain .",22
"the girl smiled . "" dorian , "" she answered , lingering over his name with long - drawn music in her voice , as though it were sweeter than honey to the red petals of her mouth . "" dorian , you should have understood . but you understand now , do n't you ? """,18
"she looked at him in wonder and laughed . he made no answer . she came across to him , and with her little fingers stroked his hair . she knelt down and pressed his hands to her lips . he drew them away , and a shudder ran through him .",41
adele and mrs . fairfax drew near to see the pictures .,5
"milady put him from her slowly with her hand , while drawing him nearer with her look ; but felton , in his turn , embraced her more closely , imploring her like a divinity .",11
"their companions had drawn near , and the gratitude with which their hearts were charged was about to express itself in their gestures and words . captain nemo stopped them by a sign , and in a voice which betrayed more emotion than he doubtless intended to show .",3
"it was long past noon when he awoke . his valet had crept several times on tiptoe into the room to see if he was stirring , and had wondered what made his young master sleep so late . finally his bell sounded , and victor came in softly with a cup of tea , and a pile of letters , on a small tray of old sevres china , and drew back the olive - satin curtains , with their shimmering blue lining , that hung in front of the three tall windows .",71
"the road between prospect heights and the sources of the stream was already partly beaten , and with a better cart than the first , the material could be easily conveyed to the spot , especially if they could manage to capture some animals to draw it .",45
""" suppose , that during our absence , master jup takes it into his head to draw up the ladder which he so politely returned to us yesterday ? """,16
"he made no answer at first , but remained quite still . the knocking still continued and grew louder . yes , it was better to let lord henry in , and to explain to him the new life he was going to lead , to quarrel with him if it became necessary to quarrel , to part if parting was inevitable . he jumped up , drew the screen hastily across the picture , and unlocked the door .",67
"he would not draw back from any task : a determined sportsman , he would make a business of what till then had only been a pleasure to him .",3
"d’artagnan drew up his request , and m. de treville , on receiving it , assured him that by two o’clock in the morning the four leaves of absence should be at the respective domiciles of the travelers .",1

he was already taught to make himself useful by drawing loads of wood and carting away the stones which were extracted from the bed of creek glycerine .,9
"as he closed the door behind him , dorian gray touched the bell , and in a few minutes victor appeared with the lamps and drew the blinds down . he waited impatiently for him to go . the man seemed to take an interminable time over everything .",25
"he drew the screen back into its former place in front of the picture , smiling as he did so , and passed into his bedroom , where his valet was already waiting for him . an hour later he was at the opera , and lord henry was leaning over his chair .",1
""" i , monseigneur ? "" said athos . "" i did not even draw my sword , but i took him who offended me round the body , and threw him out of the window . it appears that in falling , "" continued athos , with some hesitation , "" he broke his thigh . """,14
"cyrus harding and his companions had drawn near the divan , and now arranged the cushions in such a manner as to better support the dying man .",6
"then came a new development . i had drawn you as paris in dainty armour , and as adonis with huntsman 's cloak and polished boar- spear . crowned with heavy lotus - blossoms you had sat on the prow of adrian 's barge , gazing across the green turbid nile . you had leaned over the still pool of some greek woodland and seen in the water 's silent silver the marvel of your own face . and it had all been what art should be -- unconscious , ideal , and remote . one day , a fatal day i sometimes think , i determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are , not in the costume of dead ages , but in your own dress and in your own time . whether it was the realism of the method , or the mere wonder of your own personality , thus directly presented to me without mist or veil , i can not tell . but i know that as i worked at it , every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret .",8
"dorian gray drew a long breath . the colour came back to his cheeks , and a smile played about his lips . the peril was over . he was safe for the time . yet he could not help feeling infinite pity for the painter who had just made this strange confession to him , and wondered if he himself would ever be so dominated by the personality of a friend . lord henry had the charm of being very dangerous . but that was all . he was too clever and too cynical to be really fond of . would there ever be some one who would fill him with a strange idolatry ? was that one of the things that life had in store ?",2
"a fifth shot from ayrton laid one low , and the others drew back , not understanding what was going on .",12
"for several hours that day , i wielded my pick doggedly . the work kept me going . besides , working meant leaving the nautilus , which meant breathing the clean oxygen drawn from the air tanks and supplied by our equipment , which meant leaving the thin , foul air behind .",32
yet i drew near and knocked .,2
"i drew near houses ; i left them , and came back again , and again i wandered away : always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to ask -- no right to expect interest in my isolated lot .",1
"a brisk breeze arose about ten o'clock ; but , though it might have been prudent to take in a reef , the pilot , after carefully examining the heavens , let the craft remain rigged as before . the tankadere bore sail admirably , as she drew a great deal of water , and everything was prepared for high speed in case of a gale .",47
the colonists drew around him .,2
"another three hours , and i saw no bottom to the chimney yet . when i lifted my head i perceived the gradual contraction of its aperture . its walls , by a gentle incline , were drawing closer to each other , and it was beginning to grow darker .",37
""" i liked bonbons too in those days , miss eyre , and i was _ croquant_--(overlook the barbarism)--_croquant _ chocolate comfits , and smoking alternately , watching meantime the equipages that rolled along the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera - house , when in an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of english horses , and distinctly seen in the brilliant city - night , i recognised the ' voiture ' i had given celine .",50
"he sighed , and having poured himself out some tea , opened lord henry 's note . it was simply to say that he sent him round the evening paper , and a book that might interest him , and that he would be at the club at eight - fifteen . he opened the st . james 's languidly , and looked through it . a red pencil - mark on the fifth page caught his eye . it drew attention to the following paragraph :",80

"the intelligence with which lestrade greeted us was so momentous and so unexpected , that we were all three fairly dumfoundered . gregson sprang out of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water . i stared in silence at sherlock holmes , whose lips were compressed and his brows drawn down over his eyes .",53
"how different it was with material things ! where had they passed to ? where was the great crocus - coloured robe , on which the gods fought against the giants , that had been worked by brown girls for the pleasure of athena ? where the huge velarium that nero had stretched across the colosseum at rome , that titan sail of purple on which was represented the starry sky , and apollo driving a chariot drawn by white , gilt - reined steeds ? he longed to see the curious table - napkins wrought for the priest of the sun , on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast ; the mortuary cloth of king chilperic , with its three hundred golden bees ; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the bishop of pontus and were figured with "" lions , panthers , bears , dogs , forests , rocks , hunters -- all , in fact , that a painter can copy from nature "" ; and the coat that charles of orleans once wore , on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning "" madame , je suis tout joyeux , "" the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread , and each note , of square shape in those days , formed with four pearls .",77

my star vanished as i drew near : some obstacle had intervened between me and it .,5
"the ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint : the friendly frankness , as correct as cordial , with which he treated me , drew me to him .",26
"when the lady of the red cushion came close to porthos , porthos drew his dripping hand from the font .",13
"as additional precaution , pencroft , neb , and ayrton drew it up on a little beach which bordered one of the sides of the grotto , in a spot where it could run no risk of harm .",10
""" i will now cut one of these pills in two , "" said holmes , and drawing his penknife he suited the action to the word .

""" i , madame ? "" said porthos , drawing himself up proudly ; "" how so ? """,9
"with a perfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box , cut the other pill in two , dissolved it , added milk , and presented it to the terrier . the unfortunate creature 's tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in it before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb , and lay as rigid and lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning . sherlock holmes drew a long breath , and wiped the perspiration from his forehead .

"as i approached the hut , walking as warily as stapleton would do when with poised net he drew near the settled butterfly , i satisfied myself that the place had indeed been used as a habitation . a vague pathway among the boulders led to the dilapidated opening which served as a door . all was silent within . the unknown might be lurking there , or he might be prowling on the moor . my nerves tingled with the sense of adventure . throwing aside my cigarette , i closed my hand upon the butt of my revolver and , walking swiftly up to the door , i looked in . the place was empty .",18
""" all this seems strange to you , "" continued holmes , "" because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you . i had the good fortune to seize upon that , and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition , and , indeed , was the logical sequence of it . hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure , have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions . it is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery . the most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn . this murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those outré and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable . these strange details , far from making the case more difficult , have really had the effect of making it less so .

"for a minute i stood there with the paper in my hands thinking out the meaning of this curt message . it was i , then , and not sir henry , who was being dogged by this secret man . he had not followed me himself , but he had set an agent -- the boy , perhaps -- upon my track , and this was his report . possibly i had taken no step since i had been upon the moor which had not been observed and reported . always there was this feeling of an unseen force , a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and delicacy , holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme moment that one realized that one was indeed entangled in its meshes .",104
"thus pressed by us all , holmes showed signs of irresolution . he continued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest and his brows drawn down , as was his habit when lost in thought .",31
"looking down on this very scene , there stood upon the fourth of may , eighteen hundred and forty - seven , a solitary traveller . his appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region . an observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty . his face was lean and haggard , and the brown parchment - like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones ; his long , brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white ; his eyes were sunken in his head , and burned with an unnatural lustre ; while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton . as he stood , he leaned upon his weapon for support , and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution . his gaunt face , however , and his clothes , which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs , proclaimed what it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance . the man was dying — dying from hunger and from thirst .",78
"as to athos , he went out without any mystery , took his horse , which was tied with those of his friends to the fastenings of the shutters , in four words convinced the attendant of the necessity of a vanguard for their return , carefully examined the priming of his pistols , drew his sword , and took , like a forlorn hope , the road to the camp .",54
"its fishing finished , the nautilus drew nearer to the coast . in this locality a number of sea turtles were sleeping on the surface of the waves . it would have been difficult to capture these valuable reptiles , because they wake up at the slightest sound , and their solid carapaces are harpoon - proof . but our suckerfish would effect their capture with extraordinary certainty and precision . in truth , this animal is a living fishhook , promising wealth and happiness to the greenest fisherman in the business .",6
"and both , with free use of the spur , arrived at st . omer without drawing bit .",16
"how many other marvelous new specimens i still could have observed if , little by little , the nautilus had n't settled to the lower strata ! its slanting fins drew it to depths of 2,000 and 3,500 meters . there animal life was represented by nothing more than sea lilies , starfish , delightful crinoids with bell - shaped heads like little chalices on straight stems , top - shell snails , blood - red tooth shells , and fissurella snails , a large species of coastal mollusk .",30

"in the midst of the watery mass , brightly lit by our electric beams , there snaked past those one - meter lampreys that are common to nearly every clime . a type of ray from the genus oxyrhynchus , five feet wide , had a white belly with a spotted , ash - gray back and was carried along by the currents like a huge , wide - open shawl . other rays passed by so quickly i could n't tell if they deserved that name "" eagle ray "" coined by the ancient greeks , or those designations of "" rat ray , "" "" bat ray , "" and "" toad ray "" that modern fishermen have inflicted on them . dogfish known as topes , twelve feet long and especially feared by divers , were racing with each other . looking like big bluish shadows , thresher sharks went by , eight feet long and gifted with an extremely acute sense of smell . dorados from the genus sparus , some measuring up to thirteen decimeters , appeared in silver and azure costumes encircled with ribbons , which contrasted with the dark color of their fins ; fish sacred to the goddess venus , their eyes set in brows of gold ; a valuable species that patronizes all waters fresh or salt , equally at home in rivers , lakes , and oceans , living in every clime , tolerating any temperature , their line dating back to prehistoric times on this earth yet preserving all its beauty from those far - off days . magnificent sturgeons , nine to ten meters long and extremely fast , banged their powerful tails against the glass of our panels , showing bluish backs with small brown spots ; they resemble sharks , without equaling their strength , and are encountered in every sea ; in the spring they delight in swimming up the great rivers , fighting the currents of the volga , danube , po , rhine , loire , and oder , while feeding on herring , mackerel , salmon , and codfish ; although they belong to the class of cartilaginous fish , they rate as a delicacy ; they 're eaten fresh , dried , marinated , or salt - preserved , and in olden times they were borne in triumph to the table of the roman epicure lucullus . but whenever the nautilus drew near the surface , those denizens of the mediterranean i could observe most productively belonged to the sixty - third genus of bony fish . these were tuna from the genus scomber , blue - black on top , silver on the belly armor , their dorsal stripes giving off a golden gleam . they are said to follow ships in search of refreshing shade from the hot tropical sun , and they did just that with the nautilus , as they had once done with the vessels of the count de la pérouse . for long hours they competed in speed with our submersible . i could n't stop marveling at these animals so perfectly cut out for racing , their heads small , their bodies sleek , spindle - shaped , and in some cases over three meters long , their pectoral fins gifted with remarkable strength , their caudal fins forked . like certain flocks of birds , whose speed they equal , these tuna swim in triangle formation , which prompted the ancients to say they 'd boned up on geometry and military strategy . and yet they ca n't escape the provençal fishermen , who prize them as highly as did the ancient inhabitants of turkey and italy ; and these valuable animals , as oblivious as if they were deaf and blind , leap right into the marseilles tuna nets and perish by the thousands .",410
