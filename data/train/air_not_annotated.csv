"our breakfast - table was cleared early , and holmes waited in his dressing - gown for the promised interview . our clients were punctual to their appointment , for the clock had just struck ten when dr . mortimer was shown up , followed by the young baronet . the latter was a small , alert , dark - eyed man about thirty years of age , very sturdily built , with thick black eyebrows and a strong , pugnacious face . he wore a ruddy - tinted tweed suit and had the weather - beaten appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air , and yet there was something in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated the gentleman .",110

"in essence , on july 20 , 1866 , the steamer governor higginson , from the calcutta & burnach steam navigation co. , encountered this moving mass five miles off the eastern shores of australia . captain baker at first thought he was in the presence of an unknown reef ; he was even about to fix its exact position when two waterspouts shot out of this inexplicable object and sprang hissing into the air some 150 feet . so , unless this reef was subject to the intermittent eruptions of a geyser , the governor higginson had fair and honest dealings with some aquatic mammal , until then unknown , that could spurt from its blowholes waterspouts mixed with air and steam .",120

"a sandy beach unfolded before us , measuring 500 feet at its widest point between the waters of the lake and the foot of the mountain 's walls . via this strand you could easily circle the lake . but the base of these high walls consisted of broken soil over which there lay picturesque piles of volcanic blocks and enormous pumice stones . all these crumbling masses were covered with an enamel polished by the action of underground fires , and they glistened under the stream of electric light from our beacon . stirred up by our footsteps , the mica - rich dust on this beach flew into the air like a cloud of sparks .",111
"she felt by intuition the flame of the opposing passions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young fanatic . as a skillful general , seeing the enemy ready to surrender , marches toward him with a cry of victory , she rose , beautiful as an antique priestess , inspired like a christian virgin , her arms extended , her throat uncovered , her hair disheveled , holding with one hand her robe modestly drawn over her breast , her look illumined by that fire which had already created such disorder in the veins of the young puritan , and went toward him , crying out with a vehement air , and in her melodious voice , to which on this occasion she communicated a terrible energy :",113
"at certain turns in the trail we were going along , the lake appeared in its full expanse . the ship 's beacon lit up that whole placid surface , which experienced neither ripples nor undulations . the nautilus lay perfectly still . on its platform and on the embankment , crewmen were bustling around , black shadows that stood out clearly in the midst of the luminous air .",68

"we every day pass through the air hole some bread at the end of a fork , and some meat when he asks for it ; but alas ! it is not of bread and meat of which he makes the greatest consumption .",6
"finally , to conclude , conseil classified a large number of flying fish . nothing could have made a more unusual sight than the marvelous timing with which dolphins hunt these fish . whatever the range of its flight , however evasive its trajectory ( even up and over the nautilus ) , the hapless flying fish always found a dolphin to welcome it with open mouth . these were either flying gurnards or kitelike sea robins , whose lips glowed in the dark , at night scrawling fiery streaks in the air before plunging into the murky waters like so many shooting stars .",92
"having uttered these words with a cool , careless air , the detective took leave of the consul , and repaired to the telegraph office , whence he sent the dispatch which we have seen to the london police office . a quarter of an hour later found fix , with a small bag in his hand , proceeding on board the mongolia ; and , ere many moments longer , the noble steamer rode out at full steam upon the waters of the red sea .",9
""" oho ! we know that , do we ? "" captain nemo replied in a tone of mild surprise . "" well , professor , we have good reason to know it because it 's the truth . i might add , in fact , that the air bladders of fish contain more nitrogen than oxygen when these animals are caught at the surface of the water , and conversely , more oxygen than nitrogen when they 're pulled up from the lower depths . which bears out your formulation . but let 's continue our observations .

"but soon these last representatives of animal life vanished , and three vertical leagues down , the nautilus passed below the limits of underwater existence just as an air balloon rises above the breathable zones in the sky . we reached a depth of 16,000 meters-- four vertical leagues -- and by then the nautilus 's plating was tolerating a pressure of 1,600 atmospheres , in other words , 1,600 kilograms per each square centimeter on its surface !",28

"a small fly or moth had fluttered across our path , and in an instant stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it . to my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire , and my acquaintance never paused for an instant , bounding from tuft to tuft behind it , his green net waving in the air . his gray clothes and jerky , zigzag , irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself . i was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the treacherous mire , when i heard the sound of steps , and turning round found a woman near me upon the path . she had come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of merripit house , but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close .",63

"" of course i go and stay with them every summer after i come from homburg , but then an old woman like me must have fresh air sometimes , and besides , i really wake them up . you do n't know what an existence they lead down there . it is pure unadulterated country life . they get up early , because they have so much to do , and go to bed early , because they have so little to think about . there has not been a scandal in the neighbourhood since the time of queen elizabeth , and consequently they all fall asleep after dinner . you sha n't sit next either of them . you shall sit by me and amuse me . """,98
"at half - past twelve the travellers caught sight for an instant of fort halleck , which commands that section ; and in a few more hours the rocky mountains were crossed . there was reason to hope , then , that no accident would mark the journey through this difficult country . the snow had ceased falling , and the air became crisp and cold . large birds , frightened by the locomotive , rose and flew off in the distance . no wild beast appeared on the plain . it was a desert in its vast nakedness .",61
"captain nemo walked in front , and his companion followed us a few steps to the rear . conseil and i stayed next to each other , as if daydreaming that through our metal carapaces , a little polite conversation might still be possible ! already i no longer felt the bulkiness of my clothes , footwear , and air tank , nor the weight of the heavy sphere inside which my head was rattling like an almond in its shell . once immersed in water , all these objects lost a part of their weight equal to the weight of the liquid they displaced , and thanks to this law of physics discovered by archimedes , i did just fine . i was no longer an inert mass , and i had , comparatively speaking , great freedom of movement .",59
"we had been gone from the nautilus for about an hour and a half . it was almost noon . i spotted this fact in the perpendicularity of the sun 's rays , which were no longer refracted . the magic of these solar colors disappeared little by little , with emerald and sapphire shades vanishing from our surroundings altogether . we walked with steady steps that rang on the seafloor with astonishing intensity . the tiniest sounds were transmitted with a speed to which the ear is unaccustomed on shore . in fact , water is a better conductor of sound than air , and under the waves noises carry four times as fast .",103
"but the skies became more and more threatening . there were conspicuous signs of a hurricane on the way . the atmosphere was turning white and milky . slender sheaves of cirrus clouds were followed on the horizon by layers of nimbocumulus . other low clouds fled swiftly . the sea grew towering , inflated by long swells . every bird had disappeared except a few petrels , friends of the storms . the barometer fell significantly , indicating a tremendous tension in the surrounding haze . the mixture in our stormglass decomposed under the influence of the electricity charging the air . a struggle of the elements was approaching .",101
"this incident did not interrupt our walk . for two hours we were sometimes led over plains of sand , sometimes over prairies of seaweed that were quite arduous to cross . in all honesty , i was dead tired by the time i spotted a hazy glow half a mile away , cutting through the darkness of the waters . it was the nautilus 's beacon . within twenty minutes we would be on board , and there i could breathe easy again -- because my tank 's current air supply seemed to be quite low in oxygen . but i was reckoning without an encounter that slightly delayed our arrival .",90
"as midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air , dorian gray , dressed commonly , and with a muffler wrapped round his throat , crept quietly out of his house . in bond street he found a hansom with a good horse . he hailed it and in a low voice gave the driver an address .",9
"and miss ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air , and exclaimed , "" oh , what a little puppet ! """,11
"nothing could be more simple . indeed , it was all so simple that fix and passepartout felt their hearts beating as if they would crack . they were listening for the whistle agreed upon , when suddenly savage cries resounded in the air , accompanied by reports which certainly did not issue from the car where the duellists were . the reports continued in front and the whole length of the train . cries of terror proceeded from the interior of the cars .",43
"but while so many catastrophes were taking place on land and at sea , a drama not less exciting was being enacted in the agitated air .",25
"loud peals of thunder broke , and could scarcely be distinguished from the rumblings of the mountain , whose mouth vomited forth ignited rocks , which , hurled to more than a thousand feet , burst in the air like shells .",38
"meanwhile the nautilus rose slowly to the surface of the sea , and i watched the avenger 's murky shape disappearing little by little . soon a gentle rolling told me that we were afloat in the open air .",38
"at dawn , some of the lighter clouds had risen into the more lofty regions of the air .",17
""" i am aware of that ; but , tell me , will not air at last acquire the density of water ? """,14
"she appeared to be on her high horse to - night ; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite not only the admiration , but the amazement of her auditors : she was evidently bent on striking them as something very dashing and daring indeed .",17
""" now is my time to slip away , "" thought i : but the tones that then severed the air arrested me .",20
"the vessel was two miles off . it drew nearer , always moving toward the phosphorescent glow that signaled the nautilus 's presence . i saw its green and red running lights , plus the white lantern hanging from the large stay of its foremast . hazy flickerings were reflected on its rigging and indicated that its furnaces were pushed to the limit . showers of sparks and cinders of flaming coal escaped from its funnels , spangling the air with stars .",79
"then new layers of bruised pyrites were arranged so as to form an immense heap , the exterior of which was covered with earth and grass , several air - holes being left , as if it was a stack of wood which was to be carbonized to make charcoal .",28
"milady , however , smiled in observing that she excelled the young woman by far in her high air and aristocratic bearing .",18
"both her cast of form and feature , her complexion and her general air , suggested the idea of some israelitish princess of the patriarchal days ; and such was doubtless the character she intended to represent .",13
"i would have been deeply interested in visiting this long , 360-league reef , against which the ever - surging sea broke with the fearsome intensity of thunderclaps . but just then the nautilus 's slanting fins took us to great depths , and i could see nothing of those high coral walls . i had to rest content with the various specimens of fish brought up by our nets . among others i noted some long - finned albacore , a species in the genus scomber , as big as tuna , bluish on the flanks , and streaked with crosswise stripes that disappear when the animal dies . these fish followed us in schools and supplied our table with very dainty flesh . we also caught a large number of yellow - green gilthead , half a decimeter long and tasting like dorado , plus some flying gurnards , authentic underwater swallows that , on dark nights , alternately streak air and water with their phosphorescent glimmers . among mollusks and zoophytes , i found in our trawl 's meshes various species of alcyonarian coral , sea urchins , hammer shells , spurred - star shells , wentletrap snails , horn shells , glass snails . the local flora was represented by fine floating algae : sea tangle , and kelp from the genus macrocystis , saturated with the mucilage their pores perspire , from which i selected a wonderful nemastoma geliniaroidea , classifying it with the natural curiosities in the museum .",162
"the procurator had without doubt been warned of his visit , as he expressed no surprise at the sight of porthos , who advanced toward him with a sufficiently easy air , and saluted him courteously .",30
"suddenly there was no ground under me . i felt myself revolving in air , striking and rebounding against the craggy projections of a vertical gallery , quite a well ; my head struck against a sharp corner of the rock , and i became unconscious .",13
stones were projected in the air as if by the eruption of a volcano .,5
"dorian strolled along by his side . the keen aromatic air , the brown and red lights that glimmered in the wood , the hoarse cries of the beaters ringing out from time to time , and the sharp snaps of the guns that followed , fascinated him and filled him with a sense of delightful freedom . he was dominated by the carelessness of happiness , by the high indifference of joy .",10
"dâ€™artagnan remained for a moment motionless , asking himself where he could be ; but soon a ray of light which penetrated through the chamber , together with the warm and perfumed air which reached him from the same aperture , the conversation of two of three ladies in language at once respectful and refined , and the word "" majesty "" several times repeated , indicated clearly that he was in a closet attached to the queen â€™s apartment .",32
"we were in reality shut up inside an immeasurable excavation . its width could not be estimated , since the shore ran widening as far as eye could reach , nor could its length , for the dim horizon bounded the new . as for its height , it must have been several leagues . where this vault rested upon its granite base no eye could tell ; but there was a cloud hanging far above , the height of which we estimated at 12,000 feet , a greater height than that of any terrestrial vapour , and no doubt due to the great density of the air .",107
it will be easily conceived that after an imprisonment of forty seven days in a narrow gallery it was the height of physical enjoyment to breathe a moist air impregnated with saline particles .,28
"in less than a quarter of an hour , dorian gray was galloping down the long avenue as hard as he could go . the trees seemed to sweep past him in spectral procession , and wild shadows to fling themselves across his path . once the mare swerved at a white gate - post and nearly threw him . he lashed her across the neck with his crop . she cleft the dusky air like an arrow . the stones flew from her hoofs .",74
"his long improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears . among other things , i hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of von weber .",29
""" my dear fellow , "" said lord henry , elevating his eyebrows in surprise , "" i asked you because i thought you might be able to give me an answer . that is all . i was going through the park last sunday , and close by the marble arch there stood a little crowd of shabby - looking people listening to some vulgar street- preacher . as i passed by , i heard the man yelling out that question to his audience . it struck me as being rather dramatic . london is very rich in curious effects of that kind . a wet sunday , an uncouth christian in a mackintosh , a ring of sickly white faces under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas , and a wonderful phrase flung into the air by shrill hysterical lips -- it was really very good in its way , quite a suggestion . i thought of telling the prophet that art had a soul , but that man had not . i am afraid , however , he would not have understood me .

""" why have you stopped playing , dorian ? go back and give me the nocturne over again . look at that great , honey - coloured moon that hangs in the dusky air . she is waiting for you to charm her , and if you play she will come closer to the earth . you wo n't ? let us go to the club , then . it has been a charming evening , and we must end it charmingly . there is some one at white 's who wants immensely to know you -- young lord poole , bournemouth 's eldest son . he has already copied your neckties , and has begged me to introduce him to you . he is quite delightful and rather reminds me of you .

"he spoke with the most noble disdain to everyone , carried his nose so high , strained his voice to such a pitch , assumed so imperious an air , and stalked with so much loftiness and pride , that everyone who had the honor of conversing with him was violently tempted to bastinade his excellency .",28
"this done , he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in the wall bordering the orchard . i , supposing he had done with me , prepared to return to the house ; again , however , i heard him call "" jane ! """,10

"' that you wo n't ' thought alice , and , after waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit just under the window , she suddenly spread out her hand , and made a snatch in the air . she did not get hold of anything , but she heard a little shriek and a fall , and a crash of broken glass , from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber - frame , or something of the sort .",38
"there was a long silence after this , and alice could only hear whispers now and then ; such as , ' sure , i do n't like it , yer honour , at all , at all ! ' ' do as i tell you , you coward ! ' and at last she spread out her hand again , and made another snatch in the air . this time there were two little shrieks , and more sounds of broken glass . ' what a number of cucumber - frames there must be ! ' thought alice .

"at this demand dâ€™artagnan gave his name very modestly , emphasized the title of compatriot , and begged the servant who had put the question to him to request a moment â€™s audience of m. de treville -- a request which the other , with an air of protection , promised to transmit in due season .",46
"it was for this reason , as he said to those around him , that he had put on his cloak ; and while he spoke with a lofty air and twisted his mustache disdainfully , all admired his embroidered baldric , and dâ€™artagnan more than anyone .",29

"the mediterranean , your ideal blue sea : to greeks simply "" the sea , "" to hebrews "" the great sea , "" to romans mare nostrum . bordered by orange trees , aloes , cactus , and maritime pine trees , perfumed with the scent of myrtle , framed by rugged mountains , saturated with clean , transparent air but continuously under construction by fires in the earth , this sea is a genuine battlefield where neptune and pluto still struggle for world domination . here on these beaches and waters , says the french historian michelet , a man is revived by one of the most invigorating climates in the world .",60
"accordingly , our speed was twenty - five miles ( that is , twelve four - kilometer leagues ) per hour . needless to say , ned land had to give up his escape plans , much to his distress . swept along at the rate of twelve to thirteen meters per second , he could hardly make use of the skiff . leaving the nautilus under these conditions would have been like jumping off a train racing at this speed , a rash move if there ever was one . moreover , to renew our air supply , the submersible rose to the surface of the waves only at night , and relying solely on compass and log , it steered by dead reckoning .",96
"the wind shook some blossoms from the trees , and the heavy lilac - blooms , with their clustering stars , moved to and fro in the languid air . a grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall , and like a blue thread a long thin dragon - fly floated past on its brown gauze wings . lord henry felt as if he could hear basil hallward 's heart beating , and wondered what was coming .",28
