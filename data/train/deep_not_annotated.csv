"during january , february , and part of march , the deep snows , and , after their melting , the almost impassable roads , prevented our stirring beyond the garden walls , except to go to church ; but within these limits we had to pass an hour every day in the open air .",11
"it was a horrible wound . the cranium had been smashed open by some blunt instrument , leaving the naked brains exposed , and the cerebral matter had suffered deep abrasions . blood clots had formed in this dissolving mass , taking on the color of wine dregs . both contusion and concussion of the brain had occurred . the sick man 's breathing was labored , and muscle spasms quivered in his face . cerebral inflammation was complete and had brought on a paralysis of movement and sensation .",29
"i say 150 meters , although i had no instruments for estimating this distance . but i knew that the sun 's rays , even in the clearest seas , could reach no deeper . so at precisely this point the darkness became profound . not a single object was visible past ten paces . consequently , i had begun to grope my way when suddenly i saw the glow of an intense white light . captain nemo had just activated his electric device . his companion did likewise . conseil and i followed suit . by turning a switch , i established contact between the induction coil and the glass spiral , and the sea , lit up by our four lanterns , was illuminated for a radius of twenty - five meters .",33
"she heaved a deep sigh . it was a sigh of relief . the terrible moment , the moment that night and day , for weeks and months , she had dreaded , had come at last , and yet she felt no terror . indeed , in some measure it was a disappointment to her . the vulgar directness of the question called for a direct answer . the situation had not been gradually led up to . it was crude . it reminded her of a bad rehearsal .",3
""" me , i 'm out like a light ! "" ned land replied . my two companions lay down on the cabin 's carpeting and were soon deep in slumber . as for me , i gave in less readily to this intense need for sleep . too many thoughts had piled up in my mind , too many insoluble questions had arisen , too many images were keeping my eyelids open ! where were we ? what strange power was carrying us along ? i felt -- or at least i thought i did -- the submersible sinking toward the sea 's lower strata . intense nightmares besieged me . in these mysterious marine sanctuaries , i envisioned hosts of unknown animals , and this underwater boat seemed to be a blood relation of theirs : living , breathing , just as fearsome . . . ! then my mind grew calmer , my imagination melted into hazy drowsiness , and i soon fell into an uneasy slumber .",28
"luckily these voracious animals have poor eyesight . they went by without noticing us , grazing us with their brownish fins ; and miraculously , we escaped a danger greater than encountering a tiger deep in the jungle .",34

"the sea is of no great depth at the grand banks . a few hundred fathoms at best . but to the south there is a deep , suddenly occurring depression , a 3,000-meter pit . here the gulf stream widens . its waters come to full bloom . it loses its speed and temperature , but it turns into a sea .",26
"at the end of the room there was a little staircase , leading to a darkened chamber . as dorian hurried up its three rickety steps , the heavy odour of opium met him . he heaved a deep breath , and his nostrils quivered with pleasure . when he entered , a young man with smooth yellow hair , who was bending over a lamp lighting a long thin pipe , looked up at him and nodded in a hesitating manner .",38
"by evening there was still no improvement in our situation . the ice stayed between 400 and 500 meters deep . it was obviously shrinking , but what a barrier still lay between us and the surface of the ocean !",19
"barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against the glass . his profile was half turned towards me , and his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the moor . for some minutes he stood watching intently . then he gave a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light . instantly i made my way back to my room , and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing once more upon their return journey . long afterwards when i had fallen into a light sleep i heard a key turn somewhere in a lock , but i could not tell whence the sound came . what it all means i can not guess , but there is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of . i do not trouble you with my theories , for you asked me to furnish you only with facts . i have had a long talk with sir henry this morning , and we have made a plan of campaign founded upon my observations of last night . i will not speak about it just now , but it should make my next report interesting reading .",54
"deep was my gratification to find i had really a place in their unsophisticated hearts : i promised them that never a week should pass in future that i did not visit them , and give them an hour 's teaching in their school .",0

"during the first days of the journey aouda became better acquainted with her protector , and constantly gave evidence of her deep gratitude for what he had done . the phlegmatic gentleman listened to her , apparently at least , with coldness , neither his voice nor his manner betraying the slightest emotion ; but he seemed to be always on the watch that nothing should be wanting to aouda 's comfort . he visited her regularly each day at certain hours , not so much to talk himself , as to sit and hear her talk . he treated her with the strictest politeness , but with the precision of an automaton , the movements of which had been arranged for this purpose . aouda did not quite know what to make of him , though passepartout had given her some hints of his master 's eccentricity , and made her smile by telling her of the wager which was sending him round the world . after all , she owed phileas fogg her life , and she always regarded him through the exalting medium of her gratitude .",21
"the thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were watching caught sight of the number on our door , and ran rapidly across the roadway . we heard a loud knock , a deep voice below , and heavy steps ascending the stair .",38
i now ventured to descend : it was deep dusk ; i retired into a corner and sat down on the floor .,8
"i did n't answer the canadian . i wanted no arguments . deep down , i was determined to fully exploit the good fortune that had put me on board the nautilus .",12
