"the stream of lava swelled like a river about to overflow its banks , and threatened to demolish the sole obstacle which could prevent it from overrunning the whole far west .",7
"in fact , the second stream of lava , which had followed the valley of falls river , a valley of great extent , the land on both sides of the creek being flat , met with no obstacle .",16

"aside and in special compartments , strings of supremely beautiful pearls were spread out , the electric light flecking them with little fiery sparks : pink pearls pulled from saltwater fan shells in the red sea ; green pearls from the rainbow abalone ; yellow , blue , and black pearls , the unusual handiwork of various mollusks from every ocean and of certain mussels from rivers up north ; in short , several specimens of incalculable worth that had been oozed by the rarest of shellfish . some of these pearls were bigger than a pigeon egg ; they more than equaled the one that the explorer tavernier sold the shah of persia for 3,000,000 francs , and they surpassed that other pearl owned by the imam of muscat , which i had believed to be unrivaled in the entire world .",66

"for a fare of twenty francs , the vehicle went down broadway to union square , took fourth ave . to its junction with bowery st . , turned into katrin st . and halted at pier 34 . there the katrin ferry transferred men , horses , and carriage to brooklyn , that great new york annex located on the left bank of the east river , and in a few minutes we arrived at the wharf next to which the abraham lincoln was vomiting torrents of black smoke from its two funnels .",66
"they also heard the noise of a waterfall , which showed that a few hundred feet up the river there was a natural barrier .",18
"the wharves of brooklyn , and every part of new york bordering the east river , were crowded with curiosity seekers . departing from 500,000 throats , three cheers burst forth in succession . thousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses , hailing the abraham lincoln until it reached the waters of the hudson river , at the tip of the long peninsula that forms new york city .",57
"the colonists first visited the valley opening to the south of the volcano , and which first received the waters of falls river .",22
"it could already be seen that , of the numerous valleys branching off at the base of mount franklin , three only were wooded and rich in pasturage like that of the corral , which bordered on the west on the falls river valley , and on the east on the red creek valley .",42
"these two streams , which lower down became rivers by the absorption of several tributaries , were formed by all the springs of the mountain and thus caused the fertility of its southern part .",8
"a complete survey of the coast had not yet been made , and the colonists had but an imperfect idea of the shore to the west and north , from the mouth of falls river to the mandible capes , as well as of the narrow bay between them , which opened like a shark 's jaws .",34
"the latter was then led towards the mouth of the mercy , and all climbing the left bank of the river , reached prospect heights .",20
they advanced more rapidly and easily along the bank of the river than in the forest .,11

"for two days we visited these deep and deserted waters by means of our slanting fins . the nautilus would do long , diagonal dives that took us to every level . but on april 11 it rose suddenly , and the shore reappeared at the mouth of the amazon river , a huge estuary whose outflow is so considerable , it desalts the sea over an area of several leagues .",50
"the sixth day of our being at sea we came into yarmouth roads ; the wind having been contrary and the weather calm , we had made but little way since the storm . here we were obliged to come to an anchor , and here we lay , the wind continuing contrary — viz . at south - west — for seven or eight days , during which time a great many ships from newcastle came into the same roads , as the common harbour where the ships might wait for a wind for the river .",96
