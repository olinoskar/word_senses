"it is true that this theory met with a most obstinate opponent in m. elie de beaumont . this high authority maintained that the soil of moulin quignon was not diluvial at all , but was of much more recent formation ; and , agreeing in that with cuvier , he refused to admit that the human species could be contemporary with the animals of the quaternary period . my uncle liedenbrock , along with the great body of the geologists , had maintained his ground , disputed , and argued , until m. elie de beaumont stood almost alone in his opinion .",51
"often these chains of barren rocks made a dip towards the sea , and encroached upon the scanty pasturage : but there was always enough room to pass . besides , our horses instinctively chose the easiest places without ever slackening their pace . my uncle was refused even the satisfaction of stirring up his beast with whip or voice . he had no excuse for being impatient . i could not help smiling to see so tall a man on so small a pony , and as his long legs nearly touched the ground he looked like a six - legged centaur .",47

"on the 23rd , several officers circled the island and brought back some rubble of little importance . the natives , adopting a system of denial and evasion , refused to guide them to the site of the casualty . this rather shady conduct aroused the suspicion that the natives had mistreated the castaways ; and in truth , the natives seemed afraid that dumont d'urville had come to avenge the count de la pérouse and his unfortunate companions .",29

"as the dawn was just breaking , he found himself close to covent garden . the darkness lifted , and , flushed with faint fires , the sky hollowed itself into a perfect pearl . huge carts filled with nodding lilies rumbled slowly down the polished empty street . the air was heavy with the perfume of the flowers , and their beauty seemed to bring him an anodyne for his pain . he followed into the market and watched the men unloading their waggons . a white - smocked carter offered him some cherries . he thanked him , wondered why he refused to accept any money for them , and began to eat them listlessly . they had been plucked at midnight , and the coldness of the moon had entered into them .",103

""" but it was some time coming . the old gentleman could not be decoyed outside of his grounds at night . several times stapleton lurked about with his hound , but without avail . it was during these fruitless quests that he , or rather his ally , was seen by peasants , and that the legend of the demon dog received a new confirmation . he had hoped that his wife might lure sir charles to his ruin , but here she proved unexpectedly independent . she would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in a sentimental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy . threats and even , i am sorry to say , blows refused to move her . she would have nothing to do with it , and for a time stapleton was at a deadlock .",121
""" it is possible that stapleton did not know of the existence of an heir in canada . in any case he would very soon learn it from his friend dr . mortimer , and he was told by the latter all details about the arrival of henry baskerville . stapleton 's first idea was that this young stranger from canada might possibly be done to death in london without coming down to devonshire at all . he distrusted his wife ever since she had refused to help him in laying a trap for the old man , and he dared not leave her long out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her . it was for this reason that he took her to london with him . they lodged , i find , at the mexborough private hotel , in craven street , which was actually one of those called upon by my agent in search of evidence . here he kept his wife imprisoned in her room while he , disguised in a beard , followed dr . mortimer to baker street and afterwards to the station and to the northumberland hotel . his wife had some inkling of his plans ; but she had such a fear of her husband -- a fear founded upon brutal ill - treatment -- that she dare not write to warn the man whom she knew to be in danger . if the letter should fall into stapleton 's hands her own life would not be safe . eventually , as we know , she adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would form the message , and addressing the letter in a disguised hand . it reached the baronet , and gave him the first warning of his danger .",85
