"it took us two hours to reach the summit of this half - crystal , half - basalt peak . from there our eyes scanned a vast sea , which scrawled its boundary line firmly against the background of the northern sky . at our feet : dazzling tracts of white . over our heads : a pale azure , clear of mists . north of us : the sun 's disk , like a ball of fire already cut into by the edge of the horizon . from the heart of the waters : jets of liquid rising like hundreds of magnificent bouquets . far off , like a sleeping cetacean : the nautilus . behind us to the south and east : an immense shore , a chaotic heap of rocks and ice whose limits we could n't see .",134
"the thermometer marked -12 degrees centigrade , and a fresh breeze left a sharp nip in the air . ice floes were increasing over the open water . the sea was starting to congeal everywhere . numerous blackish patches were spreading over its surface , announcing the imminent formation of fresh ice . obviously this southernmost basin froze over during its six - month winter and became utterly inaccessible . what happened to the whales during this period ? no doubt they went beneath the ice bank to find more feasible seas . as for seals and walruses , they were accustomed to living in the harshest climates and stayed on in these icy waterways . these animals know by instinct how to gouge holes in the ice fields and keep them continually open ; they go to these holes to breathe . once the birds have migrated northward to escape the cold , these marine mammals remain as sole lords of the polar continent .",19

"it was an insane idea . fortunately i controlled myself and stretched out on the bed to soothe my bodily agitation . my nerves calmed a little , but with my brain so aroused , i did a swift review of my whole existence aboard the nautilus , every pleasant or unpleasant incident that had crossed my path since i went overboard from the abraham lincoln : the underwater hunting trip , the torres strait , our running aground , the savages of papua , the coral cemetery , the suez passageway , the island of santorini , the cretan diver , the bay of vigo , atlantis , the ice bank , the south pole , our imprisonment in the ice , the battle with the devilfish , the storm in the gulf stream , the avenger , and that horrible scene of the vessel sinking with its crew . . . ! all these events passed before my eyes like backdrops unrolling upstage in a theater . in this strange setting captain nemo then grew fantastically . his features were accentuated , taking on superhuman proportions . he was no longer my equal , he was the man of the waters , the spirit of the seas .",110

mrs . reed 's hands still lay on her work inactive : her eye of ice continued to dwell freezingly on mine .,15
""" borings will tell us that . i 'm going to ground the nautilus on the lower shelf , then my men will put on their diving suits and attack the thinnest of these ice walls . """,34
"work began immediately and was carried on with tireless tenacity . instead of digging all around the nautilus , which would have entailed even greater difficulties , captain nemo had an immense trench outlined on the ice , eight meters from our port quarter . then his men simultaneously staked it off at several points around its circumference . soon their picks were vigorously attacking this compact matter , and huge chunks were loosened from its mass . these chunks weighed less than the water , and by an unusual effect of specific gravity , each chunk took wing , as it were , to the roof of the tunnel , which thickened above by as much as it diminished below . but this hardly mattered so long as the lower surface kept growing thinner .",36
"i approached my cheek to her lips : she would not touch it . she said i oppressed her by leaning over the bed , and again demanded water . as i laid her down -- for i raised her and supported her on my arm while she drank -- i covered her ice - cold and clammy hand with mine : the feeble fingers shrank from my touch -- the glazing eyes shunned my gaze .",53
"reader , do you know , as i do , what terror those cold people can put into the ice of their questions ?",19
"it was some foul parody , some infamous ignoble satire . he had never done that . still , it was his own picture . he knew it , and he felt as if his blood had changed in a moment from fire to sluggish ice . his own picture ! what did it mean ? why had it altered ? he turned and looked at dorian gray with the eyes of a sick man . his mouth twitched , and his parched tongue seemed unable to articulate . he passed his hand across his forehead . it was dank with clammy sweat .",45
"this bed of fine sand was as smooth as ice , not a grain out of place .",9
a terrible scream -- a prolonged yell of horror and anguish -- burst out of the silence of the moor . that frightful cry turned the blood to ice in my veins .,28
""" he was one of your great seamen , "" the captain told me , "" one of your shrewdest navigators , that d'urville ! he was the frenchman 's captain cook . a man wise but unlucky ! braving the ice banks of the south pole , the coral of oceania , the cannibals of the pacific , only to perish wretchedly in a train wreck ! if that energetic man was able to think about his life in its last seconds , imagine what his final thoughts must have been ! """,41
"on march 14 at latitude 55 degrees , i spotted floating ice , plain pale bits of rubble twenty to twenty - five feet long , which formed reefs over which the sea burst into foam . the nautilus stayed on the surface of the ocean . having fished in the arctic seas , ned land was already familiar with the sight of icebergs . conseil and i were marveling at them for the first time .",11
"in the sky toward the southern horizon , there stretched a dazzling white band . english whalers have given this the name "" ice blink . "" no matter how heavy the clouds may be , they ca n't obscure this phenomenon . it announces the presence of a pack , or shoal , of ice .",23
"indeed , larger blocks of ice soon appeared , their brilliance varying at the whim of the mists . some of these masses displayed green veins , as if scrawled with undulating lines of copper sulfate . others looked like enormous amethysts , letting the light penetrate their insides . the latter reflected the sun 's rays from the thousand facets of their crystals . the former , tinted with a bright limestone sheen , would have supplied enough building material to make a whole marble town .",5
"guided by his skillful hands , the nautilus passed by all these different masses of ice , which are classified by size and shape with a precision that enraptured conseil : "" icebergs , "" or mountains ; "" ice fields , "" or smooth , limitless tracts ; "" drift ice , "" or floating floes ; "" packs , "" or broken tracts , called "" patches "" when they 're circular and "" streams "" when they form long strips .",15

"and in all honesty , i confess that this venturesome excursion was far from displeasing to me . i ca n't express the intensity of my amazement at the beauties of these new regions . the ice struck superb poses . here , its general effect suggested an oriental town with countless minarets and mosques . there , a city in ruins , flung to the ground by convulsions in the earth . these views were varied continuously by the sun 's oblique rays , or were completely swallowed up by gray mists in the middle of blizzards . then explosions , cave - ins , and great iceberg somersaults would occur all around us , altering the scenery like the changing landscape in a diorama .",36
"often , no longer seeing any way out , i thought we were imprisoned for good , but captain nemo , guided by his instincts , discovered new passageways from the tiniest indications . he was never wrong when he observed slender threads of bluish water streaking through these ice fields . accordingly , i was sure that he had already risked his nautilus in the midst of the antarctic seas .",49
"however , during the day of march 16 , these tracts of ice completely barred our path . it was n't the ice bank as yet , just huge ice fields cemented together by the cold . this obstacle could n't stop captain nemo , and he launched his ship against the ice fields with hideous violence . the nautilus went into these brittle masses like a wedge , splitting them with dreadful cracklings . it was an old - fashioned battering ram propelled with infinite power . hurled aloft , ice rubble fell back around us like hail . through brute force alone , the submersible carved out a channel for itself . carried away by its momentum , the ship sometimes mounted on top of these tracts of ice and crushed them with its weight , or at other times , when cooped up beneath the ice fields , it split them with simple pitching movements , creating wide punctures .",12

"in my excursion i met but few people . on returning to the main street i found the greater part of the population busied in drying , salting , and putting on board codfish , their chief export . the men looked like robust but heavy , blond germans with pensive eyes , conscious of being far removed from their fellow creatures , poor exiles relegated to this land of ice , poor creatures who should have been esquimaux , since nature had condemned them to live only just outside the arctic circle ! in vain did i try to detect a smile upon their lips ; sometimes by a spasmodic and involuntary contraction of the muscles they seemed to laugh , but they never smiled .",70

"meanwhile preparations for this daring attempt were getting under way . the nautilus 's powerful pumps forced air down into the tanks and stored it under high pressure . near four o'clock captain nemo informed me that the platform hatches were about to be closed . i took a last look at the dense ice bank we were going to conquer . the weather was fair , the skies reasonably clear , the cold quite brisk , namely -12 degrees centigrade ; but after the wind had lulled , this temperature did n't seem too unbearable .",54
"ice accumulated at the mouth of the mercy , and it was not long before the whole expanse of the lake was frozen .",0
"that night my sleep was fitful . hope and fear besieged me by turns . i got up several times . the nautilus continued groping . near three o'clock in the morning , i observed that we encountered the ice bank 's underbelly at a depth of only fifty meters . so only 150 feet separated us from the surface of the water . little by little the ice bank was turning into an ice field again . the mountains were changing back into plains .",68
