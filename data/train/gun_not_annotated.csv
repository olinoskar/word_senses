"the arms consisted of two of purdy 's rifles and two brace of pistols . but what did we want arms for ? we had neither savages nor wild beasts to fear , i supposed . but my uncle seemed to believe in his arsenal as in his instruments , and more especially in a considerable quantity of gun cotton , which is unaffected by moisture , and the explosive force of which exceeds that of gunpowder .",58

"my first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this moor , to get something for our subsistence on board ; for i told him we must not presume to eat of our patron ’s bread . he said that was true ; so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit , and three jars of fresh water , into the boat . i knew where my patron ’s case of bottles stood , which it was evident , by the make , were taken out of some english prize , and i conveyed them into the boat while the moor was on shore , as if they had been there before for our master . i conveyed also a great lump of beeswax into the boat , which weighed about half a hundred - weight , with a parcel of twine or thread , a hatchet , a saw , and a hammer , all of which were of great use to us afterwards , especially the wax , to make candles . another trick i tried upon him , which he innocently came into also : his name was ismael , which they call muley , or moely ; so i called to him—“moely , ” said i , “ our patron ’s guns are on board the boat ; can you not get a little powder and shot ? it may be we may kill some alcamies ( a fowl like our curlews ) for ourselves , for i know he keeps the gunner ’s stores in the ship . ” “ yes , ” says he , “ i ’ll bring some ; ” and accordingly he brought a great leather pouch , which held a pound and a half of powder , or rather more ; and another with shot , that had five or six pounds , with some bullets , and put all into the boat . at the same time i had found some powder of my master ’s in the great cabin , with which i filled one of the large bottles in the case , which was almost empty , pouring what was in it into another ; and thus furnished with everything needful , we sailed out of the port to fish . the castle , which is at the entrance of the port , knew who we were , and took no notice of us ; and we were not above a mile out of the port before we hauled in our sail and set us down to fish . the wind blew from the n.n.e . , which was contrary to my desire , for had it blown southerly i had been sure to have made the coast of spain , and at least reached to the bay of cadiz ; but my resolutions were , blow which way it would , i would be gone from that horrid place where i was , and leave the rest to fate .",219

"“ xury , ” says i , “ you shall on shore and kill him . ” xury , looked frighted , and said , “ me kill ! he eat me at one mouth!”—one mouthful he meant . however , i said no more to the boy , but bade him lie still , and i took our biggest gun , which was almost musket - bore , and loaded it with a good charge of powder , and with two slugs , and laid it down ; then i loaded another gun with two bullets ; and the third ( for we had three pieces ) i loaded with five smaller bullets . i took the best aim i could with the first piece to have shot him in the head , but he lay so with his leg raised a little above his nose , that the slugs hit his leg about the knee and broke the bone . he started up , growling at first , but finding his leg broken , fell down again ; and then got upon three legs , and gave the most hideous roar that ever i heard . i was a little surprised that i had not hit him on the head ; however , i took up the second piece immediately , and though he began to move off , fired again , and shot him in the head , and had the pleasure to see him drop and make but little noise , but lie struggling for life . then xury took heart , and would have me let him go on shore .",93
