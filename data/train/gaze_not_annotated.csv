"the london express came roaring into the station , and a small , wiry bulldog of a man had sprung from a first - class carriage . we all three shook hands , and i saw at once from the reverential way in which lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a good deal since the days when they had first worked together . i could well remember the scorn which the theories of the reasoner used then to excite in the practical man .",45
"a quarter of an hour afterwards , amidst an extraordinary turmoil of applause , sibyl vane stepped on to the stage . yes , she was certainly lovely to look at-- one of the loveliest creatures , lord henry thought , that he had ever seen . there was something of the fawn in her shy grace and startled eyes . a faint blush , like the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver , came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded enthusiastic house . she stepped back a few paces and her lips seemed to tremble . basil hallward leaped to his feet and began to applaud . motionless , and as one in a dream , sat dorian gray , gazing at her . lord henry peered through his glasses , murmuring , "" charming ! charming !

""" there 's been a woman here , "" he cried . "" it 's a woman 's wedding - ring . "" he held it out , as he spoke , upon the palm of his hand . we all gathered round him and gazed at it . there could be no doubt that that circlet of plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride .",45

"as he often remembered afterwards , and always with no small wonder , he found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost scientific interest . that such a change should have taken place was incredible to him . and yet it was a fact . was there some subtle affinity between the chemical atoms that shaped themselves into form and colour on the canvas and the soul that was within him ? could it be that what that soul thought , they realized?--that what it dreamed , they made true ? or was there some other , more terrible reason ? he shuddered , and felt afraid , and , going back to the couch , lay there , gazing at the picture in sickened horror .",18

"then came a new development . i had drawn you as paris in dainty armour , and as adonis with huntsman 's cloak and polished boar- spear . crowned with heavy lotus - blossoms you had sat on the prow of adrian 's barge , gazing across the green turbid nile . you had leaned over the still pool of some greek woodland and seen in the water 's silent silver the marvel of your own face . and it had all been what art should be -- unconscious , ideal , and remote . one day , a fatal day i sometimes think , i determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are , not in the costume of dead ages , but in your own dress and in your own time . whether it was the realism of the method , or the mere wonder of your own personality , thus directly presented to me without mist or veil , i can not tell . but i know that as i worked at it , every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret .",45
"all the way , and in proportion as the corridors became more deserted , d’artagnan wished to stop the young woman , seize her and gaze upon her , were it only for a minute ; but quick as a bird she glided between his hands , and when he wished to speak to her , her finger placed upon her mouth , with a little imperative gesture full of grace , reminded him that he was under the command of a power which he must blindly obey , and which forbade him even to make the slightest complaint . at length , after winding about for a minute or two , mme . bonacieux opened the door of a closet , which was entirely dark , and led d’artagnan into it .",25

"he felt that the eyes of dorian gray were fixed on him , and the consciousness that amongst his audience there was one whose temperament he wished to fascinate seemed to give his wit keenness and to lend colour to his imagination . he was brilliant , fantastic , irresponsible . he charmed his listeners out of themselves , and they followed his pipe , laughing . dorian gray never took his gaze off him , but sat like one under a spell , smiles chasing each other over his lips and wonder growing grave in his darkening eyes .",72

"it was a warm june morning , and the latter day saints were as busy as the bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem . in the fields and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry . down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavily - laden mules , all heading to the west , for the gold fever had broken out in california , and the overland route lay through the city of the elect . there , too , were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands , and trains of tired immigrants , men and horses equally weary of their interminable journey . through all this motley assemblage , threading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider , there galloped lucy ferrier , her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out behind her . she had a commission from her father in the city , and was dashing in as she had done many a time before , with all the fearlessness of youth , thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed . the travel - stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment , and even the unemotional indians , journeying in with their pelties , relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale - faced maiden .",206

"after two hours the guide stopped the elephant , and gave him an hour for rest , during which kiouni , after quenching his thirst at a neighbouring spring , set to devouring the branches and shrubs round about him . neither sir francis nor mr . fogg regretted the delay , and both descended with a feeling of relief .

"it was a squid of colossal dimensions , fully eight meters long . it was traveling backward with tremendous speed in the same direction as the nautilus . it gazed with enormous , staring eyes that were tinted sea green . its eight arms ( or more accurately , feet ) were rooted in its head , which has earned these animals the name cephalopod ; its arms stretched a distance twice the length of its body and were writhing like the serpentine hair of the furies . you could plainly see its 250 suckers , arranged over the inner sides of its tentacles and shaped like semispheric capsules . sometimes these suckers fastened onto the lounge window by creating vacuums against it . the monster 's mouth -- a beak made of horn and shaped like that of a parrot -- opened and closed vertically . its tongue , also of horn substance and armed with several rows of sharp teeth , would flicker out from between these genuine shears . what a freak of nature ! a bird 's beak on a mollusk ! its body was spindle - shaped and swollen in the middle , a fleshy mass that must have weighed 20,000 to 25,000 kilograms . its unstable color would change with tremendous speed as the animal grew irritated , passing successively from bluish gray to reddish brown .",29
"i must have been mad to allow myself to be carried away so , "" says she , gazing into the glass , which reflects back to her eyes the burning glance by which she appears to interrogate herself .",18

"as for our neglect , our isolation in the depths of this cell , i was afraid to guess at how long it might last . little by little , hopes i had entertained after our interview with the ship 's commander were fading away . the gentleness of the man 's gaze , the generosity expressed in his facial features , the nobility of his bearing , all vanished from my memory . i saw this mystifying individual anew for what he inevitably must be : cruel and merciless . i viewed him as outside humanity , beyond all feelings of compassion , the implacable foe of his fellow man , toward whom he must have sworn an undying hate !",52
"then he paused , as if he knew not which way to turn . he lifted his hand and opened his eyelids ; gazed blank , and with a straining effort , on the sky , and toward the amphitheatre of trees : one saw that all to him was void darkness .",23
"we had arranged no plan of campaign , but the baronet is a man to whom the most direct way is always the most natural . he walked into the room , and as he did so barrymore sprang up from the window with a sharp hiss of his breath and stood , livid and trembling , before us . his dark eyes , glaring out of the white mask of his face , were full of horror and astonishment as he gazed from sir henry to me .",82
