""" exactly . i fancy the yew alley , though not marked under that name , must stretch along this line , with the moor , as you perceive , upon the right of it . this small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of grimpen , where our friend dr . mortimer has his headquarters . within a radius of five miles there are , as you see , only a very few scattered dwellings . here is lafter hall , which was mentioned in the narrative . there is a house indicated here which may be the residence of the naturalist -- stapleton , if i remember right , was his name . here are two moorland farm - houses , high tor and foulmire . then fourteen miles away the great convict prison of princetown . between and around these scattered points extends the desolate , lifeless moor . this , then , is the stage upon which tragedy has been played , and upon which we may help to play it again .

""" a dog ! "" said holmes . "" by jove , a curly - haired spaniel . poor mortimer will never see his pet again . well , i do not know that this place contains any secret which we have not already fathomed . he could hide his hound , but he could not hush its voice , and hence came those cries which even in daylight were not pleasant to hear . on an emergency he could keep the hound in the out - house at merripit , but it was always a risk , and it was only on the supreme day , which he regarded as the end of all his efforts , that he dared do it . this paste in the tin is no doubt the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed . it was suggested , of course , by the story of the family hell - hound , and by the desire to frighten old sir charles to death . no wonder the poor devil of a convict ran and screamed , even as our friend did , and as we ourselves might have done , when he saw such a creature bounding through the darkness of the moor upon his track . it was a cunning device , for , apart from the chance of driving your victim to his death , what peasant would venture to inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight of it , as many have done , upon the moor ? i said it in london , watson , and i say it again now , that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more dangerous man than he who is lying yonder""--he swept his long arm towards the huge mottled expanse of green - splotched bog which stretched away until it merged into the russet slopes of the moor .",178

"the creature understood , seized the cord , glided rapidly down the beach , and disappeared in the darkness without the convicts ' attention having been in the least excited .",21
"the most important thing is , that the convicts should believe that the inhabitants of the island are numerous , and consequently capable of resisting them .",8
"indeed , their whole force would have been barely sufficient to cope with the convicts , and just now no one could leave granite house .",14
"here was luck indeed ! and yet i suppressed all appearance of interest . a child ! barrymore had said that our unknown was supplied by a boy . it was on his track , and not upon the convict 's , that frankland had stumbled . if i could get his knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt . but incredulity and indifference were evidently my strongest cards .",39
""" i think , "" answered the engineer , "" that the combat will now take a new form , for it can not be supposed that the convicts will be so foolish as to remain in a position so unfavorable for them ! """,28
""" to hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like this convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk recapture by screaming wildly for help . by his cries he must have run a long way after he knew the animal was on his track . how did he know ? """,16
"after crossing a few narrow streets where some convicts , in trousers half yellow and half grey , were at work under the orders of the gangers , we arrived at the vor frelsers kirk . there was nothing remarkable about the church ; but there was a reason why its tall spire had attracted the professor 's attention . starting from the top of the tower , an external staircase wound around the spire , the spirals circling up into the sky .",8
