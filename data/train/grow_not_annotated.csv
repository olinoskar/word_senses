"when the nautilus returned to the surface of the ocean , i could take in reao island over its whole flat , wooded expanse . obviously its madreporic rocks had been made fertile by tornadoes and thunderstorms . one day , carried off by a hurricane from neighboring shores , some seed fell onto these limestone beds , mixing with decomposed particles of fish and marine plants to form vegetable humus . propelled by the waves , a coconut arrived on this new coast . its germ took root . its tree grew tall , catching steam off the water . a brook was born . little by little , vegetation spread . tiny animals -- worms , insects -- rode ashore on tree trunks snatched from islands to windward . turtles came to lay their eggs . birds nested in the young trees . in this way animal life developed , and drawn by the greenery and fertile soil , man appeared . and that 's how these islands were formed , the immense achievement of microscopic animals .",92

"it was an insane idea . fortunately i controlled myself and stretched out on the bed to soothe my bodily agitation . my nerves calmed a little , but with my brain so aroused , i did a swift review of my whole existence aboard the nautilus , every pleasant or unpleasant incident that had crossed my path since i went overboard from the abraham lincoln : the underwater hunting trip , the torres strait , our running aground , the savages of papua , the coral cemetery , the suez passageway , the island of santorini , the cretan diver , the bay of vigo , atlantis , the ice bank , the south pole , our imprisonment in the ice , the battle with the devilfish , the storm in the gulf stream , the avenger , and that horrible scene of the vessel sinking with its crew . . . ! all these events passed before my eyes like backdrops unrolling upstage in a theater . in this strange setting captain nemo then grew fantastically . his features were accentuated , taking on superhuman proportions . he was no longer my equal , he was the man of the waters , the spirit of the seas .",176
"after half an hour of walking , the seafloor grew rocky . jellyfish , microscopic crustaceans , and sea - pen coral lit it faintly with their phosphorescent glimmers . i glimpsed piles of stones covered by a couple million zoophytes and tangles of algae . my feet often slipped on this viscous seaweed carpet , and without my alpenstock i would have fallen more than once . when i turned around , i could still see the nautilus 's whitish beacon , which was starting to grow pale in the distance .",9

"this was where the nautilus had been sent accidentally-- or perhaps deliberately -- by its captain . it was sweeping around in a spiral whose radius kept growing smaller and smaller . the skiff , still attached to the ship 's plating , was likewise carried around at dizzying speed . i could feel us whirling . i was experiencing that accompanying nausea that follows such continuous spinning motions . we were in dread , in the last stages of sheer horror , our blood frozen in our veins , our nerves numb , drenched in cold sweat as if from the throes of dying ! and what a noise around our frail skiff ! what roars echoing from several miles away ! what crashes from the waters breaking against sharp rocks on the seafloor , where the hardest objects are smashed , where tree trunks are worn down and worked into "" a shaggy fur , "" as norwegians express it !",27

"captain nemo went in . we followed him . my eyes soon grew accustomed to this comparative gloom . i distinguished the unpredictably contoured springings of a vault , supported by natural pillars firmly based on a granite foundation , like the weighty columns of tuscan architecture . why had our incomprehensible guide taken us into the depths of this underwater crypt ? i would soon find out .",12
"i approached this phenomenal mollusk . its mass of filaments attached it to a table of granite , and there it grew by itself in the midst of the cave 's calm waters . i estimated the weight of this giant clam at 300 kilograms . hence such an oyster held fifteen kilos of meat , and you 'd need the stomach of king gargantua to eat a couple dozen .",21
"soon after , mrs . reed grew more composed , and sank into a dozing state . i then left her .",6
"i then understood captain nemo 's intent . by leaving the pearl buried beneath the giant clam 's mantle , he allowed it to grow imperceptibly . with each passing year the mollusk 's secretions added new concentric layers . the captain alone was familiar with the cave where this wonderful fruit of nature was "" ripening "" ; he alone reared it , so to speak , in order to transfer it one day to his dearly beloved museum . perhaps , following the examples of oyster farmers in china and india , he had even predetermined the creation of this pearl by sticking under the mollusk 's folds some piece of glass or metal that was gradually covered with mother - of - pearl . in any case , comparing this pearl to others i already knew about , and to those shimmering in the captain 's collection , i estimated that it was worth at least 10,000,000 francs . it was a superb natural curiosity rather than a luxurious piece of jewelry , because i do n't know of any female ear that could handle it .",24

"work began immediately and was carried on with tireless tenacity . instead of digging all around the nautilus , which would have entailed even greater difficulties , captain nemo had an immense trench outlined on the ice , eight meters from our port quarter . then his men simultaneously staked it off at several points around its circumference . soon their picks were vigorously attacking this compact matter , and huge chunks were loosened from its mass . these chunks weighed less than the water , and by an unusual effect of specific gravity , each chunk took wing , as it were , to the roof of the tunnel , which thickened above by as much as it diminished below . but this hardly mattered so long as the lower surface kept growing thinner .",133

"what a struggle ! ned land quickly grew enthusiastic and even ended up applauding . brandished in its captain 's hands , the nautilus was simply a fearsome harpoon . he hurled it at those fleshy masses and ran them clean through , leaving behind two squirming animal halves . as for those daunting strokes of the tail hitting our sides , the ship never felt them . no more than the collisions it caused . one sperm whale exterminated , it ran at another , tacked on the spot so as not to miss its prey , went ahead or astern , obeyed its rudder , dived when the cetacean sank to deeper strata , rose with it when it returned to the surface , struck it head - on or slantwise , hacked at it or tore it , and from every direction and at any speed , skewered it with its dreadful spur .",7

"what rage then drove us against these monsters ! we lost all self - control . ten or twelve devilfish had overrun the nautilus 's platform and sides . we piled helter - skelter into the thick of these sawed - off snakes , which darted over the platform amid waves of blood and sepia ink . it seemed as if these viscous tentacles grew back like the many heads of hydra . at every thrust ned land 's harpoon would plunge into a squid 's sea - green eye and burst it . but my daring companion was suddenly toppled by the tentacles of a monster he could not avoid .",64
"we had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from the road and wound away across the moor . a steep , boulder - sprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone days been cut into a granite quarry . the face which was turned towards us formed a dark cliff , with ferns and brambles growing in its niches . from over a distant rise there floated a gray plume of smoke .",62

"soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table : she opened it , and found in it a very small cake , on which the words ' eat me ' were beautifully marked in currants .

"she ate a little bit , and said anxiously to herself , ' which way ? which way ? ' , holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing , and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size : to be sure , this generally happens when one eats cake , but alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out - of - the - way things to happen , that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way .",36
"in three hours i had seen not only the town but its environs . the general aspect was wonderfully dull . no trees , and scarcely any vegetation . everywhere bare rocks , signs of volcanic action . the icelandic huts are made of earth and turf , and the walls slope inward ; they rather resemble roofs placed on the ground . but then these roofs are meadows of comparative fertility . thanks to the internal heat , the grass grows on them to some degree of perfection . it is carefully mown in the hay season ; if it were not , the horses would come to pasture on these green abodes .",81
"then the scanty supply of food was distressing : with the keen appetites of growing children , we had scarcely sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid .",14
"none of the weeds carpeting the seafloor , none of the branches bristling from the shrubbery , crept , or leaned , or stretched on a horizontal plane . they all rose right up toward the surface of the ocean . every filament or ribbon , no matter how thin , stood ramrod straight . fucus plants and creepers were growing in stiff perpendicular lines , governed by the density of the element that generated them . after i parted them with my hands , these otherwise motionless plants would shoot right back to their original positions . it was the regime of verticality .",60
"these various types of shrubbery were as big as trees in the temperate zones ; in the damp shade between them , there were clustered actual bushes of moving flowers , hedges of zoophytes in which there grew stony coral striped with twisting furrows , yellowish sea anemone from the genus caryophylia with translucent tentacles , plus anemone with grassy tufts from the genus zoantharia ; and to complete the illusion , minnows flitted from branch to branch like a swarm of hummingbirds , while there rose underfoot , like a covey of snipe , yellow fish from the genus lepisocanthus with bristling jaws and sharp scales , flying gurnards , and pinecone fish .",37
"as she said this she looked down at her hands , and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbit 's little white kid gloves while she was talking . ' how can i have done that ? ' she thought . ' i must be growing small again . ' she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it , and found that , as nearly as she could guess , she was now about two feet high , and was going on shrinking rapidly : she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding , and she dropped it hastily , just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether .",51
"clumps of trees grew on these slopes , which were also carpeted with thick grass .",3
"captain nemo continued to plummet into the dark depths of this forest , whose shrubbery grew ever more sparse . i observed that vegetable life was disappearing more quickly than animal life . the open - sea plants had already left behind the increasingly arid seafloor , where a prodigious number of animals were still swarming : zoophytes , articulates , mollusks , and fish .",15
""" true , sir , very true , "" i replied with growing excitement .",12
"but the skies became more and more threatening . there were conspicuous signs of a hurricane on the way . the atmosphere was turning white and milky . slender sheaves of cirrus clouds were followed on the horizon by layers of nimbocumulus . other low clouds fled swiftly . the sea grew towering , inflated by long swells . every bird had disappeared except a few petrels , friends of the storms . the barometer fell significantly , indicating a tremendous tension in the surrounding haze . the mixture in our stormglass decomposed under the influence of the electricity charging the air . a struggle of the elements was approaching .",51
"our return journey began . captain nemo resumed the lead in our little band , always heading forward without hesitation . i noted that we did n't follow the same path in returning to the nautilus . this new route , very steep and hence very arduous , quickly took us close to the surface of the sea . but this return to the upper strata was n't so sudden that decompression took place too quickly , which could have led to serious organic disorders and given us those internal injuries so fatal to divers . with great promptness , the light reappeared and grew stronger ; and the refraction of the sun , already low on the horizon , again ringed the edges of various objects with the entire color spectrum .",104
"for a few moments more i observed the dying man , whose life was ebbing little by little . he grew still more pale under the electric light that bathed his deathbed . i looked at his intelligent head , furrowed with premature wrinkles that misfortune , perhaps misery , had etched long before . i was hoping to detect the secret of his life in the last words that might escape from his lips !",20
"pencroft jumped up , and his great good - natured face grew pale when he saw the reporter presenting him with a ready - filled pipe , and herbert with a glowing coal .",11
"the raging sea was swept with huge tattered clouds drenched by the waves . i saw no more of the small intervening billows that form in the troughs of the big crests . just long , soot - colored undulations with crests so compact they did n't foam . they kept growing taller . they were spurring each other on . the nautilus , sometimes lying on its side , sometimes standing on end like a mast , rolled and pitched frightfully .",51
"when i took leave of this island , i carried on board , for relics , the great goat - skin cap i had made , my umbrella , and one of my parrots ; also , i forgot not to take the money i formerly mentioned , which had lain by me so long useless that it was grown rusty or tarnished , and could hardly pass for silver till it had been a little rubbed and handled , as also the money i found in the wreck of the spanish ship . and thus i left the island , the 19th of december , as i found by the ship ’s account , in the year 1686 , after i had been upon it eight - and - twenty years , two months , and nineteen days ; being delivered from this second captivity the same day of the month that i first made my escape in the long - boat from among the moors of sallee . in this vessel , after a long voyage , i arrived in england the 11th of june , in the year 1687 , having been thirty - five years absent .",59
""" me , i 'm out like a light ! "" ned land replied . my two companions lay down on the cabin 's carpeting and were soon deep in slumber . as for me , i gave in less readily to this intense need for sleep . too many thoughts had piled up in my mind , too many insoluble questions had arisen , too many images were keeping my eyelids open ! where were we ? what strange power was carrying us along ? i felt -- or at least i thought i did -- the submersible sinking toward the sea 's lower strata . intense nightmares besieged me . in these mysterious marine sanctuaries , i envisioned hosts of unknown animals , and this underwater boat seemed to be a blood relation of theirs : living , breathing , just as fearsome . . . ! then my mind grew calmer , my imagination melted into hazy drowsiness , and i soon fell into an uneasy slumber .",152
"after nightfall the storm grew in intensity . as in the 1860 cyclone on réunion island , the barometer fell to 710 millimeters . at the close of day , i saw a big ship passing on the horizon , struggling painfully . it lay to at half steam in an effort to hold steady on the waves . it must have been a steamer on one of those lines out of new york to liverpool or le havre . it soon vanished into the shadows .",4
"he bared his wrist , and offered it to me : the blood was forsaking his cheek and lips , they were growing livid ; i was distressed on all hands .",22

"suddenly he started . his eyes grew strangely bright , and he gnawed nervously at his underlip . between two of the windows stood a large florentine cabinet , made out of ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue lapis . he watched it as though it were a thing that could fascinate and make afraid , as though it held something that he longed for and yet almost loathed . his breath quickened . a mad craving came over him . he lit a cigarette and then threw it away . his eyelids drooped till the long fringed lashes almost touched his cheek . but he still watched the cabinet . at last he got up from the sofa on which he had been lying , went over to it , and having unlocked it , touched some hidden spring . a triangular drawer passed slowly out . his fingers moved instinctively towards it , dipped in , and closed on something . it was a small chinese box of black and gold - dust lacquer , elaborately wrought , the sides patterned with curved waves , and the silken cords hung with round crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads . he opened it . inside was a green paste , waxy in lustre , the odour curiously heavy and persistent .",6

"meanwhile the grave digging went slowly . fish fled here and there as their retreat was disturbed . i heard the pick ringing on the limestone soil , its iron tip sometimes giving off sparks when it hit a stray piece of flint on the sea bottom . the hole grew longer , wider , and soon was deep enough to receive the body .",50
