"the nets were hauled on board . they were a breed of trawl resembling those used off the normandy coast , huge pouches held half open by a floating pole and a chain laced through the lower meshes . trailing in this way from these iron glove makers , the resulting receptacles scoured the ocean floor and collected every marine exhibit in their path . that day they gathered up some unusual specimens from these fish - filled waterways : anglerfish whose comical movements qualify them for the epithet "" clowns , "" black commerson anglers equipped with their antennas , undulating triggerfish encircled by little red bands , bloated puffers whose venom is extremely insidious , some olive - hued lampreys , snipefish covered with silver scales , cutlass fish whose electrocuting power equals that of the electric eel and the electric ray , scaly featherbacks with brown crosswise bands , greenish codfish , several varieties of goby , etc . ; finally , some fish of larger proportions : a one - meter jack with a prominent head , several fine bonito from the genus scomber decked out in the colors blue and silver , and three magnificent tuna whose high speeds could n't save them from our trawl .",168

"on november 26 , at three o'clock in the morning , the nautilus cleared the tropic of cancer at longitude 172 degrees . on the 27th it passed in sight of the hawaiian islands , where the famous captain cook met his death on february 14 , 1779 . by then we had fared 4,860 leagues from our starting point . when i arrived on the platform that morning , i saw the island of hawaii two miles to leeward , the largest of the seven islands making up this group . i could clearly distinguish the tilled soil on its outskirts , the various mountain chains running parallel with its coastline , and its volcanoes , crowned by mauna kea , whose elevation is 5,000 meters above sea level . among other specimens from these waterways , our nets brought up some peacock - tailed flabellarian coral , polyps flattened into stylish shapes and unique to this part of the ocean .",82

"the vessel was two miles off . it drew nearer , always moving toward the phosphorescent glow that signaled the nautilus 's presence . i saw its green and red running lights , plus the white lantern hanging from the large stay of its foremast . hazy flickerings were reflected on its rigging and indicated that its furnaces were pushed to the limit . showers of sparks and cinders of flaming coal escaped from its funnels , spangling the air with stars .",40

"i would have been deeply interested in visiting this long , 360-league reef , against which the ever - surging sea broke with the fearsome intensity of thunderclaps . but just then the nautilus 's slanting fins took us to great depths , and i could see nothing of those high coral walls . i had to rest content with the various specimens of fish brought up by our nets . among others i noted some long - finned albacore , a species in the genus scomber , as big as tuna , bluish on the flanks , and streaked with crosswise stripes that disappear when the animal dies . these fish followed us in schools and supplied our table with very dainty flesh . we also caught a large number of yellow - green gilthead , half a decimeter long and tasting like dorado , plus some flying gurnards , authentic underwater swallows that , on dark nights , alternately streak air and water with their phosphorescent glimmers . among mollusks and zoophytes , i found in our trawl 's meshes various species of alcyonarian coral , sea urchins , hammer shells , spurred - star shells , wentletrap snails , horn shells , glass snails . the local flora was represented by fine floating algae : sea tangle , and kelp from the genus macrocystis , saturated with the mucilage their pores perspire , from which i selected a wonderful nemastoma geliniaroidea , classifying it with the natural curiosities in the museum .",129

"my first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this moor , to get something for our subsistence on board ; for i told him we must not presume to eat of our patron ‚Äôs bread . he said that was true ; so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit , and three jars of fresh water , into the boat . i knew where my patron ‚Äôs case of bottles stood , which it was evident , by the make , were taken out of some english prize , and i conveyed them into the boat while the moor was on shore , as if they had been there before for our master . i conveyed also a great lump of beeswax into the boat , which weighed about half a hundred - weight , with a parcel of twine or thread , a hatchet , a saw , and a hammer , all of which were of great use to us afterwards , especially the wax , to make candles . another trick i tried upon him , which he innocently came into also : his name was ismael , which they call muley , or moely ; so i called to him‚Äî‚Äúmoely , ‚Äù said i , ‚Äú our patron ‚Äôs guns are on board the boat ; can you not get a little powder and shot ? it may be we may kill some alcamies ( a fowl like our curlews ) for ourselves , for i know he keeps the gunner ‚Äôs stores in the ship . ‚Äù ‚Äú yes , ‚Äù says he , ‚Äú i ‚Äôll bring some ; ‚Äù and accordingly he brought a great leather pouch , which held a pound and a half of powder , or rather more ; and another with shot , that had five or six pounds , with some bullets , and put all into the boat . at the same time i had found some powder of my master ‚Äôs in the great cabin , with which i filled one of the large bottles in the case , which was almost empty , pouring what was in it into another ; and thus furnished with everything needful , we sailed out of the port to fish . the castle , which is at the entrance of the port , knew who we were , and took no notice of us ; and we were not above a mile out of the port before we hauled in our sail and set us down to fish . the wind blew from the n.n.e . , which was contrary to my desire , for had it blown southerly i had been sure to have made the coast of spain , and at least reached to the bay of cadiz ; but my resolutions were , blow which way it would , i would be gone from that horrid place where i was , and leave the rest to fate .",353
