"what happened when the pilot - boat came in sight of shanghai will be easily guessed . the signals made by the tankadere had been seen by the captain of the yokohama steamer , who , espying the flag at half - mast , had directed his course towards the little craft . phileas fogg , after paying the stipulated price of his passage to john busby , and rewarding that worthy with the additional sum of five hundred and fifty pounds , ascended the steamer with aouda and fix ; and they started at once for nagasaki and yokohama .",77

"on the ninth day after leaving yokohama , phileas fogg had traversed exactly one half of the terrestrial globe . the general grant passed , on the 23rd of november , the one hundred and eightieth meridian , and was at the very antipodes of london . mr . fogg had , it is true , exhausted fifty - two of the eighty days in which he was to complete the tour , and there were only twenty - eight left . but , though he was only half - way by the difference of meridians , he had really gone over two - thirds of the whole journey ; for he had been obliged to make long circuits from london to aden , from aden to bombay , from calcutta to singapore , and from singapore to yokohama . could he have followed without deviation the fiftieth parallel , which is that of london , the whole distance would only have been about twelve thousand miles ; whereas he would be forced , by the irregular methods of locomotion , to traverse twenty - six thousand , of which he had , on the 23rd of november , accomplished seventeen thousand five hundred . and now the course was a straight one , and fix was no longer there to put obstacles in their way !",202
