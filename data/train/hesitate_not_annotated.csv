"i hesitated to interrupt him . but some moments later , when he turned to me , i threw back at him a phrase he had used in the torres strait :",1
"so the nautilus hove before the entrance to the world 's most dangerous strait , a passageway that even the boldest navigators hesitated to clear : the strait that luis vaez de torres faced on returning from the south seas in melanesia , the strait in which sloops of war under captain dumont d'urville ran aground in 1840 and nearly miscarried with all hands . and even the nautilus , rising superior to every danger in the sea , was about to become intimate with its coral reefs .",22
"with a few broken words of gratitude the man turned , but he hesitated and then came back .",13

"the mendicant hesitated at first , but at the sight of the piece of silver which shone in the darkness he consented , and walked on before athos .",2
"while the objects around me — while the carvings of the ceilings , the sombre tapestries of the walls , the ebon blackness of the floors , and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as i strode , were but matters to which , or to such as which , i had been accustomed from my infancy — while i hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all this — i still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up .",60
""" dunce , "" cried milady , "" dunce ! who dares to answer for another man , when the wisest , when those most after god ’s own heart , hesitate to answer for themselves , and who ranges himself on the side of the strongest and the most fortunate , to crush the weakest and the most unfortunate .

""" certainly ; who would hesitate to acquire such renown ? if that document were divulged , a whole army of geologists would be ready to rush into the footsteps of arne saknussemm . """,5
""" my friend , "" replied harding , "" i think that in any pressing emergency we need not hesitate to trust ourselves to the ' bonadventure ' even for a longer voyage ; but you know i should see you set off to tabor island with great uneasiness , since nothing obliges you to go there . """,19
"arriving there , the young woman seemed to hesitate , as she had before done in the rue vaugirard .",8
"the gentlemen had drawn their swords , but they found themselves taken between two fires . they still hesitated an instant ; but , as before , pride prevailed , and a second kick split the door from bottom to top .",18

"but on beholding the convulsed masses heaped up on the left , no geologist would have hesitated to give them a volcanic origin , for they were unquestionably the work of subterranean convulsions .",16
""" no , i must go . i shall probably find some work awaiting me . i would stay to show you over the house , but barrymore will be a better guide than i. good - bye , and never hesitate night or day to send for me if i can be of service . """,41
"at this moment the four guards appeared at the door of the antechamber , but seeing four musketeers standing , and their swords by their sides , they hesitated about going farther .",28

"passepartout made it a point , as he made his purchases , to take a good look at the city . it was formerly defended by a noble fort , which has since become a state prison ; its commerce has dwindled away , and passepartout in vain looked about him for such a bazaar as he used to frequent in regent street . at last he came upon an elderly , crusty jew , who sold second - hand articles , and from whom he purchased a dress of scotch stuff , a large mantle , and a fine otter - skin pelisse , for which he did not hesitate to pay seventy - five pounds . he then returned triumphantly to the station .",110
