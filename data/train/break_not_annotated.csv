"as i had once done thus in my breaking away from my parents , so i could not be content now , but i must go and leave the happy view i had of being a rich and thriving man in my new plantation , only to pursue a rash and immoderate desire of rising faster than the nature of the thing admitted ; and thus i cast myself down again into the deepest gulf of human misery that ever man fell into , or perhaps could be consistent with life and a state of health in the world .",8
"the electric light suddenly went out , and two enormous waterspouts crashed onto the deck of the frigate , racing like a torrent from stem to stern , toppling crewmen , breaking spare masts and yardarms from their lashings .",31
"besides , from the shape of the crater -- the opening broken in the upper edge -- the matter would be thrown to the side opposite the fertile regions of the island .",11
"this cavern was about a hundred feet wide and a hundred and fifty in height . a large mass had been rent asunder by a subterranean disturbance . yielding to some vast power from below it had broken asunder , leaving this great hollow into which human beings were now penetrating for the first time .",37
"it was a warm june morning , and the latter day saints were as busy as the bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem . in the fields and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry . down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavily - laden mules , all heading to the west , for the gold fever had broken out in california , and the overland route lay through the city of the elect . there , too , were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands , and trains of tired immigrants , men and horses equally weary of their interminable journey . through all this motley assemblage , threading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider , there galloped lucy ferrier , her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out behind her . she had a commission from her father in the city , and was dashing in as she had done many a time before , with all the fearlessness of youth , thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed . the travel - stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment , and even the unemotional indians , journeying in with their pelties , relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale - faced maiden .",67

"the night was cold . the parsee lit a fire in the bungalow with a few dry branches , and the warmth was very grateful , provisions purchased at kholby sufficed for supper , and the travellers ate ravenously . the conversation , beginning with a few disconnected phrases , soon gave place to loud and steady snores . the guide watched kiouni , who slept standing , bolstering himself against the trunk of a large tree . nothing occurred during the night to disturb the slumberers , although occasional growls from panthers and chatterings of monkeys broke the silence ; the more formidable beasts made no cries or hostile demonstration against the occupants of the bungalow . sir francis slept heavily , like an honest soldier overcome with fatigue . passepartout was wrapped in uneasy dreams of the bouncing of the day before . as for mr . fogg , he slumbered as peacefully as if he had been in his serene mansion in saville row .",97

"the cetacean had rammed our frigate at about eleven o'clock in the evening . i therefore calculated on eight hours of swimming until sunrise . a strenuous task , but feasible , thanks to our relieving each other . the sea was pretty smooth and barely tired us . sometimes i tried to peer through the dense gloom , which was broken only by the phosphorescent flickers coming from our movements . i stared at the luminous ripples breaking over my hands , shimmering sheets spattered with blotches of bluish gray . it seemed as if we 'd plunged into a pool of quicksilver .",61

"from this point the shore ran pretty regularly north and south , broken at two - thirds of its perimeter by a narrow creek , from which it ended in a long tail , similar to the caudal appendage of a gigantic alligator .",12
"these words were followed by a very long silence , broken only by an occasional exclamation of ' hjckrrh !

"but , in short , granite house did not suffer much from the inclemency of the weather , and it was the same with the corral , which , less exposed than the plateau , and sheltered partly by mount franklin , only received the remains of the hurricanes , already broken by the forests and the high rocks of the shore .",51
"at six o'clock , sometimes afloat and sometimes submerged , the nautilus passed well out from el tur , which sat at the far end of a bay whose waters seemed to be dyed red , as captain nemo had already mentioned . then night fell in the midst of a heavy silence occasionally broken by the calls of pelicans and nocturnal birds , by the sound of surf chafing against rocks , or by the distant moan of a steamer churning the waves of the gulf with noisy blades .",54
"and , in fact , in several places they could distinguish traces , more or less recent , of the passage of a band of men -- here branches broken off the trees , perhaps to mark out the way ; there the ashes of a fire , and footprints in clayey spots ; but nothing which appeared to belong to a settled encampment .",29

"a groan broke from campbell 's lips and he shivered all over . the ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece seemed to him to be dividing time into separate atoms of agony , each of which was too terrible to be borne . he felt as if an iron ring was being slowly tightened round his forehead , as if the disgrace with which he was threatened had already come upon him . the hand upon his shoulder weighed like a hand of lead . it was intolerable . it seemed to crush him .",2
"motionless , with her burning and fixed glances , in her solitary apartment , how well the outbursts of passion which at times escape from the depths of her chest with her respiration , accompany the sound of the surf which rises , growls , roars , and breaks itself like an eternal and powerless despair against the rocks on which is built this dark and lofty castle !",48
"herbert 's life hung on a thread , and this thread might break at any moment .",12

"then wisdom altered its method and spoke of espial and discovery . this young man might be rich . if so , marriage should be thought of . against the shell of her ear broke the waves of worldly cunning . the arrows of craft shot by her . she saw the thin lips moving , and smiled .",34
"he crossed the court , ran up the two flights to athos ’s apartment , and knocked at the door enough to break it down .",22
