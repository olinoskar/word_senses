"when the nautilus returned to the surface of the ocean , i could take in reao island over its whole flat , wooded expanse . obviously its madreporic rocks had been made fertile by tornadoes and thunderstorms . one day , carried off by a hurricane from neighboring shores , some seed fell onto these limestone beds , mixing with decomposed particles of fish and marine plants to form vegetable humus . propelled by the waves , a coconut arrived on this new coast . its germ took root . its tree grew tall , catching steam off the water . a brook was born . little by little , vegetation spread . tiny animals -- worms , insects -- rode ashore on tree trunks snatched from islands to windward . turtles came to lay their eggs . birds nested in the young trees . in this way animal life developed , and drawn by the greenery and fertile soil , man appeared . and that 's how these islands were formed , the immense achievement of microscopic animals .",174
"an immense saloon -- a sort of museum , in which were heaped up , with all the treasures of the mineral world , works of art , marvels of industry -- appeared before the eyes of the colonists , who almost thought themselves suddenly transported into a land of enchantment .",1
"she allowed , therefore , half an hour to pass away ; and as at that moment all was silence in the old castle , as nothing was heard but the eternal murmur of the waves -- that immense breaking of the ocean -- with her pure , harmonious , and powerful voice , she began the first couplet of the psalm then in great favor with the puritans :",38

"some of these wrecked ships had perished in collisions , others from hitting granite reefs . i saw a few that had sunk straight down , their masting still upright , their rigging stiffened by the water . they looked like they were at anchor by some immense , open , offshore mooring where they were waiting for their departure time . when the nautilus passed between them , covering them with sheets of electricity , they seemed ready to salute us with their colors and send us their serial numbers ! but no , nothing but silence and death filled this field of catastrophes !",47

"it took us two hours to reach the summit of this half - crystal , half - basalt peak . from there our eyes scanned a vast sea , which scrawled its boundary line firmly against the background of the northern sky . at our feet : dazzling tracts of white . over our heads : a pale azure , clear of mists . north of us : the sun 's disk , like a ball of fire already cut into by the edge of the horizon . from the heart of the waters : jets of liquid rising like hundreds of magnificent bouquets . far off , like a sleeping cetacean : the nautilus . behind us to the south and east : an immense shore , a chaotic heap of rocks and ice whose limits we could n't see .",125
"this lake was only , in short , an immense center basin , which was filled by degrees by the creek , and its waters must necessarily pass to the sea by some fall .",9
"meanwhile the ballast tanks filled with water and the nautilus sank slowly . at a depth of 1,000 feet , it stopped . its propeller churned the waves and it headed due north at a speed of fifteen miles per hour . near the afternoon it was already cruising under the immense frozen carapace of the ice bank .",51
"' come , my head 's free at last !

"passepartout was crushed ; it overwhelmed him to lose the boat by three - quarters of an hour . it was his fault , for , instead of helping his master , he had not ceased putting obstacles in his path ! and when he recalled all the incidents of the tour , when he counted up the sums expended in pure loss and on his own account , when he thought that the immense stake , added to the heavy charges of this useless journey , would completely ruin mr . fogg , he overwhelmed himself with bitter self - accusations . mr . fogg , however , did not reproach him ; and , on leaving the cunard pier , only said : "" we will consult about what is best to - morrow . come .

"here is what those circumstances entailed . two miles to starboard lay gueboroa island , its coastline curving north to west like an immense arm . to the south and east , heads of coral were already on display , left uncovered by the ebbing waters . we had run aground at full tide and in one of those seas whose tides are moderate , an inconvenient state of affairs for floating the nautilus off . however , the ship had n't suffered in any way , so solidly joined was its hull . but although it could neither sink nor split open , it was in serious danger of being permanently attached to these reefs , and that would have been the finish of captain nemo 's submersible .",23
"captain nemo stopped on these last words , perhaps sorry that he had said too much . but i had guessed . whatever motives had driven him to seek independence under the seas , he remained a human being before all else ! his heart still throbbed for suffering humanity , and his immense philanthropy went out both to downtrodden races and to individuals !",53
"just then captain nemo opened a door facing the one by which i had entered the library , and i passed into an immense , splendidly lit lounge .",23
"i looked down upon the plain . an immense column of pulverized pumice , sand and dust was rising with a whirling circular motion like a waterspout ; the wind was lashing it on to that side of snæfell where we were holding on ; this dense veil , hung across the sun , threw a deep shadow over the mountain . if that huge revolving pillar sloped down , it would involve us in its whirling eddies . this phenomenon , which is not unfrequent when the wind blows from the glaciers , is called in icelandic ' mistour .

"suddenly , after a space of time that i could not measure , i felt a shock . the raft had not struck against any hard resistance , but had suddenly been checked in its fall . a waterspout , an immense liquid column , was beating upon the surface of the waters . i was suffocating ! i was drowning !",41
"the chief thing was to hinder these plunderers from reaching the plateau , for the garden and the poultry - yard would then have been at their mercy , and immense , perhaps irreparable mischief , would inevitably be the result , especially with regard to the corn - field .",30
"i looked back down the side we had just cleared . there the mountain rose only 700 to 800 feet above the plains ; but on its far slope it crowned the receding bottom of this part of the atlantic by a height twice that . my eyes scanned the distance and took in a vast area lit by intense flashes of light . in essence , this mountain was a volcano . fifty feet below its peak , amid a shower of stones and slag , a wide crater vomited torrents of lava that were dispersed in fiery cascades into the heart of the liquid mass . so situated , this volcano was an immense torch that lit up the lower plains all the way to the horizon .",115
"one day solon was conversing with some elderly wise men in the egyptian capital of sais , a town already 8,000 years of age , as documented by the annals engraved on the sacred walls of its temples . one of these elders related the history of another town 1,000 years older still . this original city of athens , ninety centuries old , had been invaded and partly destroyed by the atlanteans . these atlanteans , he said , resided on an immense continent greater than africa and asia combined , taking in an area that lay between latitude 12 degrees and 40 degrees north . their dominion extended even to egypt . they tried to enforce their rule as far as greece , but they had to retreat before the indomitable resistance of the hellenic people . centuries passed . a cataclysm occurred -- floods , earthquakes . a single night and day were enough to obliterate this atlantis , whose highest peaks ( madeira , the azores , the canaries , the cape verde islands ) still emerge above the waves .",83
"oh , why was i so short of time ! i would have gone down the steep slopes of this mountain , crossed this entire immense continent , which surely connects africa with america , and visited its great prehistoric cities . under my eyes there perhaps lay the warlike town of makhimos or the pious village of eusebes , whose gigantic inhabitants lived for whole centuries and had the strength to raise blocks of stone that still withstood the action of the waters . one day perhaps , some volcanic phenomenon will bring these sunken ruins back to the surface of the waves ! numerous underwater volcanoes have been sighted in this part of the ocean , and many ships have felt terrific tremors when passing over these turbulent depths . a few have heard hollow noises that announced some struggle of the elements far below , others have hauled in volcanic ash hurled above the waves . as far as the equator this whole seafloor is still under construction by plutonic forces . and in some remote epoch , built up by volcanic disgorgings and successive layers of lava , who knows whether the peaks of these fire - belching mountains may reappear above the surface of the atlantic !",25
"just then the moon appeared for an instant through the watery mass , casting a few pale rays over this submerged continent . it was only a fleeting glimmer , but its effect was indescribable . the captain stood up and took one last look at these immense plains ; then his hand signaled me to follow him .",47
"work began immediately and was carried on with tireless tenacity . instead of digging all around the nautilus , which would have entailed even greater difficulties , captain nemo had an immense trench outlined on the ice , eight meters from our port quarter . then his men simultaneously staked it off at several points around its circumference . soon their picks were vigorously attacking this compact matter , and huge chunks were loosened from its mass . these chunks weighed less than the water , and by an unusual effect of specific gravity , each chunk took wing , as it were , to the roof of the tunnel , which thickened above by as much as it diminished below . but this hardly mattered so long as the lower surface kept growing thinner .",31
"this stream of electricity dazzled my eyes , and after momentarily shutting them , i looked around . the nautilus was stationary . it was floating next to an embankment shaped like a wharf . as for the water now buoying the ship , it was a lake completely encircled by an inner wall about two miles in diameter , hence six miles around . its level -- as indicated by the pressure gauge -- would be the same as the outside level , because some connection had to exist between this lake and the sea . slanting inward over their base , these high walls converged to form a vault shaped like an immense upside - down funnel that measured 500 or 600 meters in height . at its summit there gaped the circular opening through which i had detected that faint glimmer , obviously daylight .",114
"during the night , in line with my forecasts , a new one - meter slice was removed from this immense socket . but in the morning , wearing my diving suit , i was crossing through the liquid mass in a temperature of -6 degrees to -7 degrees centigrade , when i noted that little by little the side walls were closing in on each other . the liquid strata farthest from the trench , not warmed by the movements of workmen and tools , were showing a tendency to solidify . in the face of this imminent new danger , what would happen to our chances for salvation , and how could we prevent this liquid medium from solidifying , then cracking the nautilus 's hull like glass ?",20

"if the grotto of guachara , in colombia , visited by humboldt , had not given up the whole of the secret of its depth to the philosopher , who investigated it to the depth of 2,500 feet , it probably did not extend much farther . the immense mammoth cave in kentucky is of gigantic proportions , since its vaulted roof rises five hundred feet [ 1 ] above the level of an unfathomable lake and travellers have explored its ramifications to the extent of forty miles . but what were these cavities compared to that in which i stood with wonder and admiration , with its sky of luminous vapours , its bursts of electric light , and a vast sea filling its bed ? my imagination fell powerless before such immensity .",48

"at an elevation of about thirty meters , the nature of the terrain changed without becoming any easier . pudding stones and trachyte gave way to black basaltic rock : here , lying in slabs all swollen with blisters ; there , shaped like actual prisms and arranged into a series of columns that supported the springings of this immense vault , a wonderful sample of natural architecture . then , among this basaltic rock , there snaked long , hardened lava flows inlaid with veins of bituminous coal and in places covered by wide carpets of sulfur . the sunshine coming through the crater had grown stronger , shedding a hazy light over all the volcanic waste forever buried in the heart of this extinct mountain .",59

"two cable lengths off the abraham lincoln 's starboard quarter , the sea seemed to be lit up from underneath . this was no mere phosphorescent phenomenon , that much was unmistakable . submerged some fathoms below the surface of the water , the monster gave off that very intense but inexplicable glow that several captains had mentioned in their reports . this magnificent radiance had to come from some force with a great illuminating capacity . the edge of its light swept over the sea in an immense , highly elongated oval , condensing at the center into a blazing core whose unbearable glow diminished by degrees outward .",88
