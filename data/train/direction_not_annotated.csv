"at five in the morning i was awoke by the neighing and pawing of four horses under my window . i dressed hastily and came down into the street . hans was finishing our packing , almost as it were without moving a limb ; and yet he did his work cleverly . my uncle made more noise than execution , and the guide seemed to pay very little attention to his energetic directions .",73

"the sails and the english flag were hoisted at ten minutes past three . mr . fogg and aouda , who were seated on deck , cast a last glance at the quay , in the hope of espying passepartout . fix was not without his fears lest chance should direct the steps of the unfortunate servant , whom he had so badly treated , in this direction ; in which case an explanation the reverse of satisfactory to the detective must have ensued . but the frenchman did not appear , and , without doubt , was still lying under the stupefying influence of the opium .",67
"speaking very slowly , he told him to tell the house - keeper that he wanted to see her , and then to go to the frame - maker and ask him to send two of his men round at once . it seemed to him that as the man left the room his eyes wandered in the direction of the screen . or was that merely his own fancy ?",58
"then he took milady in his arms , and set off briskly in the direction opposite to that which the patrol had taken .",14
"two days passed . the abraham lincoln stayed at half steam . on the offchance that the animal might be found in these waterways , a thousand methods were used to spark its interest or rouse it from its apathy . enormous sides of bacon were trailed in our wake , to the great satisfaction , i must say , of assorted sharks . while the abraham lincoln heaved to , its longboats radiated in every direction around it and did n't leave a single point of the sea unexplored . but the evening of november 4 arrived with this underwater mystery still unsolved .",76
i obeyed her directions .,3
"as to the road in question , the choice of trees had rendered its direction somewhat capricious , but at the same time it facilitated the access to a large part of the serpentine peninsula .",14
"the nautilus did n't change direction . for the time being , then , we had to set aside any hope of returning to european seas . captain nemo kept his prow pointing south . where was he taking us ? i was afraid to guess .",5
"without standing up , we stared in the direction of the forest , my hand stopping halfway to my mouth , ned land 's completing its assignment .",8
"he was walking home about eleven o'clock from lord henry 's , where he had been dining , and was wrapped in heavy furs , as the night was cold and foggy . at the corner of grosvenor square and south audley street , a man passed him in the mist , walking very fast and with the collar of his grey ulster turned up . he had a bag in his hand . dorian recognized him . it was basil hallward . a strange sense of fear , for which he could not account , came over him . he made no sign of recognition and went on quickly in the direction of his own house .",112

"sometimes when the cardinal , always on horseback , like the lowest gendarme of the army , cast a pensive glance over those works , so slowly keeping pace with his wishes , which the engineers , brought from all the corners of france , were executing under his orders , if he met a musketeer of the company of treville , he drew near and looked at him in a peculiar manner , and not recognizing in him one of our four companions , he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in another direction .",95

"while the direction was being executed , the lady consulted moved slowly up the room . i suppose i have a considerable organ of veneration , for i retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps .",2
"on the contrary , the engineer inclined it towards the south , that is to say , in the direction of the coast opposite to the sun , for it must not be forgotten that the settlers in lincoln island , as the island was situated in the southern hemisphere , saw the radiant planet describe its diurnal arc above the northern , and not above the southern horizon .",19
"phileas fogg had , without suspecting it , gained one day on his journey , and this merely because he had travelled constantly eastward ; he would , on the contrary , have lost a day had he gone in the opposite direction , that is , westward .",42
"in journeying eastward he had gone towards the sun , and the days therefore diminished for him as many times four minutes as he crossed degrees in this direction . there are three hundred and sixty degrees on the circumference of the earth ; and these three hundred and sixty degrees , multiplied by four minutes , gives precisely twenty - four hours -- that is , the day unconsciously gained . in other words , while phileas fogg , going eastward , saw the sun pass the meridian eighty times , his friends in london only saw it pass the meridian seventy - nine times . this is why they awaited him at the reform club on saturday , and not sunday , as mr . fogg thought .",28

"the merchant in london , vesting this hundred pounds in english goods , such as the captain had written for , sent them directly to him at lisbon , and he brought them all safe to me to the brazils ; among which , without my direction ( for i was too young in my business to think of them ) , he had taken care to have all sorts of tools , ironwork , and utensils necessary for my plantation , and which were of great use to me .",46
"pencroft gave him his directions as a commander to his steersman , and herbert never allowed the "" bonadventure "" to swerve even a point . the night passed quickly , as did the day of the 12th of october .",4

"upon the whole , here was an undoubted testimony that there was scarce any condition in the world so miserable but there was something negative or something positive to be thankful for in it ; and let this stand as a direction from the experience of the most miserable of all conditions in this world : that we may always find in it something to comfort ourselves from , and to set , in the description of good and evil , on the credit side of the account .",41
"aouda , leaning upon mr . fogg 's arm , observed the tumultuous scene with surprise , while fix asked a man near him what the cause of it all was . before the man could reply , a fresh agitation arose ; hurrahs and excited shouts were heard ; the staffs of the banners began to be used as offensive weapons ; and fists flew about in every direction . thumps were exchanged from the tops of the carriages and omnibuses which had been blocked up in the crowd . boots and shoes went whirling through the air , and mr . fogg thought he even heard the crack of revolvers mingling in the din , the rout approached the stairway , and flowed over the lower step . one of the parties had evidently been repulsed ; but the mere lookers - on could not tell whether mandiboy or camerfield had gained the upper hand .",69

"he strained his eyes in every direction , and his sight was excellent . no , decidedly there was nothing there .",6
"nevertheless , conseil kept towing me . sometimes he looked up , stared straight ahead , and shouted a request for directions , which was answered by a voice that was getting closer and closer . i could barely hear it . i was at the end of my strength ; my fingers gave out ; my hands were no help to me ; my mouth opened convulsively , filling with brine ; its coldness ran through me ; i raised my head one last time , then i collapsed . . . .",21
"at first , being little accustomed to learn by heart , the lessons appeared to me both long and difficult ; the frequent change from task to task , too , bewildered me ; and i was glad when , about three o'clock in the afternoon , miss smith put into my hands a border of muslin two yards long , together with needle , thimble , & c. , and sent me to sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom , with directions to hem the same .",84

""" too much noise , grace , "" said mrs . fairfax . "" remember directions ! """,15
"what a struggle ! ned land quickly grew enthusiastic and even ended up applauding . brandished in its captain 's hands , the nautilus was simply a fearsome harpoon . he hurled it at those fleshy masses and ran them clean through , leaving behind two squirming animal halves . as for those daunting strokes of the tail hitting our sides , the ship never felt them . no more than the collisions it caused . one sperm whale exterminated , it ran at another , tacked on the spot so as not to miss its prey , went ahead or astern , obeyed its rudder , dived when the cetacean sank to deeper strata , rose with it when it returned to the surface , struck it head - on or slantwise , hacked at it or tore it , and from every direction and at any speed , skewered it with its dreadful spur .",144
"the parsee , now convinced that it was impossible to force an entrance to the temple , advanced no farther , but led his companions back again . phileas fogg and sir francis cromarty also saw that nothing could be attempted in that direction .",43

"and if nothing happens without his knowledge , he knows that i am here , and am in this dreadful condition ; and if nothing happens without his appointment , he has appointed all this to befall me . nothing occurred to my thought to contradict any of these conclusions , and therefore it rested upon me with the greater force , that it must needs be that god had appointed all this to befall me ; that i was brought into this miserable circumstance by his direction , he having the sole power , not of me only , but of everything that happened in the world . immediately it followed : why has god done this to me ? what have i done to be thus used ? my conscience presently checked me in that inquiry , as if i had blasphemed , and methought it spoke to me like a voice : “ wretch ! dost _ thou _ ask what thou hast done ? look back upon a dreadful misspent life , and ask thyself what thou hast _ not _ done ? ask , why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed ? why wert thou not drowned in yarmouth roads ; killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the sallee man - of - war ; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of africa ; or drowned _ here _ , when all the crew perished but thyself ? dost _ thou _ ask , what have i done ? ” i was struck dumb with these reflections , as one astonished , and had not a word to say — no , not to answer to myself , but rose up pensive and sad , walked back to my retreat , and went up over my wall , as if i had been going to bed ; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed , and i had no inclination to sleep ; so i sat down in my chair , and lighted my lamp , for it began to be dark . now , as the apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me very much , it occurred to my thought that the brazilians take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers , and i had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests , which was quite cured , and some also that was green , and not quite cured .",87
""" seven to five !

"a small fly or moth had fluttered across our path , and in an instant stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it . to my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire , and my acquaintance never paused for an instant , bounding from tuft to tuft behind it , his green net waving in the air . his gray clothes and jerky , zigzag , irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself . i was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the treacherous mire , when i heard the sound of steps , and turning round found a woman near me upon the path . she had come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of merripit house , but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close .",137

"at ten o'clock in the evening , the skies caught on fire . the air was streaked with violent flashes of lightning . i could n't stand this brightness , but captain nemo stared straight at it , as if to inhale the spirit of the storm . a dreadful noise filled the air , a complicated noise made up of the roar of crashing breakers , the howl of the wind , claps of thunder . the wind shifted to every point of the horizon , and the cyclone left the east to return there after passing through north , west , and south , moving in the opposite direction of revolving storms in the southern hemisphere .",110
"as i said , the nautilus veered to the east . to be more accurate , i should have said to the northeast . sometimes on the surface of the waves , sometimes beneath them , the ship wandered for days amid these mists so feared by navigators . these are caused chiefly by melting ice , which keeps the air extremely damp . how many ships have perished in these waterways as they tried to get directions from the hazy lights on the coast ! how many casualties have been caused by these opaque mists ! how many collisions have occurred with these reefs , where the breaking surf is covered by the noise of the wind ! how many vessels have rammed each other , despite their running lights , despite the warnings given by their bosun 's pipes and alarm bells !",77
