"on january 28 , in latitude 9 degrees 4 ' north , when the nautilus returned at noon to the surface of the sea , it lay in sight of land some eight miles to the west . right off , i observed a cluster of mountains about 2,000 feet high , whose shapes were very whimsically sculpted . after our position fix , i reentered the lounge , and when our bearings were reported on the chart , i saw that we were off the island of ceylon , that pearl dangling from the lower lobe of the indian peninsula .",61

"i estimate -- but perhaps i 'm mistaken -- that the nautilus 's haphazard course continued for fifteen or twenty days , and i 'm not sure how long this would have gone on without the catastrophe that ended our voyage . as for captain nemo , he was no longer in the picture . as for his chief officer , the same applied . not one crewman was visible for a single instant . the nautilus cruised beneath the waters almost continuously . when it rose briefly to the surface to renew our air , the hatches opened and closed as if automated . no more positions were reported on the world map . i did n't know where we were .",107

""" in order to steer this boat to port or starboard , in short , to make turns on a horizontal plane , i use an ordinary , wide - bladed rudder that 's fastened to the rear of the sternpost and worked by a wheel and tackle . but i can also move the nautilus upward and downward on a vertical plane by the simple method of slanting its two fins , which are attached to its sides at its center of flotation ; these fins are flexible , able to assume any position , and can be operated from inside by means of powerful levers . if these fins stay parallel with the boat , the latter moves horizontally . if they slant , the nautilus follows the angle of that slant and , under its propeller 's thrust , either sinks on a diagonal as steep as it suits me , or rises on that diagonal . and similarly , if i want to return more swiftly to the surface , i throw the propeller in gear , and the water 's pressure makes the nautilus rise vertically , as an air balloon inflated with hydrogen lifts swiftly into the skies .

"there the captain fixed his position and used a chronometer to calculate his longitude , which he double - checked against his previous observations of hour angles . then he told me :",5
"at noon that day after our position fix , captain nemo climbed onto the platform , where i happened to be . i vowed not to let him go below again without at least sounding him out on his future plans . as soon as he saw me , he came over , graciously offered me a cigar , and said to me :",6
"by then we had fared nearly 13,000 leagues from our starting point in the pacific high seas . our position fix placed us in latitude 45 degrees 37 ' south and longitude 37 degrees 53 ' west . these were the same waterways where captain denham , aboard the herald , payed out 14,000 meters of sounding line without finding bottom . it was here too that lieutenant parker , aboard the american frigate congress , was unable to reach the underwater soil at 15,149 meters .",19
"in two minutes we were on the strand . loading provisions and weapons into the skiff , pushing it to sea , and positioning its two oars were the work of an instant . we had n't gone two cable lengths when a hundred savages , howling and gesticulating , entered the water up to their waists . i looked to see if their appearance might draw some of the nautilus 's men onto the platform . but no . lying well out , that enormous machine still seemed completely deserted .",23
"by then all our past sufferings were forgotten . the memory of that imprisonment under the ice faded from our minds . we had thoughts only of the future . captain nemo no longer appeared , neither in the lounge nor on the platform . the positions reported each day on the world map were put there by the chief officer , and they enabled me to determine the nautilus 's exact heading . now then , that evening it became obvious , much to my satisfaction , that we were returning north by the atlantic route .",46
