"phileas fogg gazed at the tempestuous sea , which seemed to be struggling especially to delay him , with his habitual tranquillity . he never changed countenance for an instant , though a delay of twenty hours , by making him too late for the yokohama boat , would almost inevitably cause the loss of the wager . but this man of nerve manifested neither impatience nor annoyance ; it seemed as if the storm were a part of his programme , and had been foreseen . aouda was amazed to find him as calm as he had been from the first time she saw him .",46
"the pilot went on board at six , and took his place on the bridge , to guide the rangoon through the channels to the port of hong kong . passepartout longed to ask him if the steamer had left for yokohama ; but he dared not , for he wished to preserve the spark of hope , which still remained till the last moment . he had confided his anxiety to fix who -- the sly rascal!--tried to console him by saying that mr . fogg would be in time if he took the next boat ; but this only put passepartout in a passion .",96

"passepartout was crushed ; it overwhelmed him to lose the boat by three - quarters of an hour . it was his fault , for , instead of helping his master , he had not ceased putting obstacles in his path ! and when he recalled all the incidents of the tour , when he counted up the sums expended in pure loss and on his own account , when he thought that the immense stake , added to the heavy charges of this useless journey , would completely ruin mr . fogg , he overwhelmed himself with bitter self - accusations . mr . fogg , however , did not reproach him ; and , on leaving the cunard pier , only said : "" we will consult about what is best to - morrow . come .

"in essence , i was already familiar with the whole forward part of this underwater boat , and here are its exact subdivisions going from amidships to its spur : the dining room , 5 meters long and separated from the library by a watertight bulkhead , in other words , it could n't be penetrated by the sea ; the library , 5 meters long ; the main lounge , 10 meters long , separated from the captain 's stateroom by a second watertight bulkhead ; the aforesaid stateroom , 5 meters long ; mine , 2.5 meters long ; and finally , air tanks 7.5 meters long and extending to the stempost . total : a length of 35 meters . doors were cut into the watertight bulkheads and were shut hermetically by means of india - rubber seals , which insured complete safety aboard the nautilus in the event of a leak in any one section .",15
"while fix , in a feverish , nervous state , repaired to the pilot - boat , the others directed their course to the police - station at hong kong . phileas fogg there gave passepartout 's description , and left a sum of money to be spent in the search for him . the same formalities having been gone through at the french consulate , and the palanquin having stopped at the hotel for the luggage , which had been sent back there , they returned to the wharf .",15

"the colonists were then on the shore of an unimportant little harbor , which would scarcely have contained even two or three fishing - boats . it served as a neck to the new creek , of which the curious thing was that its waters , instead of joining the sea by a gentle slope , fell from a height of more than forty feet , which explained why the rising tide was not felt up the stream .",24

"the worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat as hearty a breakfast as possible before leaving the carnatic ; but , as he had been walking about all day , the demands of hunger were becoming importunate . he observed that the butchers stalls contained neither mutton , goat , nor pork ; and , knowing also that it is a sacrilege to kill cattle , which are preserved solely for farming , he made up his mind that meat was far from plentiful in yokohama -- nor was he mistaken ; and , in default of butcher 's meat , he could have wished for a quarter of wild boar or deer , a partridge , or some quails , some game or fish , which , with rice , the japanese eat almost exclusively . but he found it necessary to keep up a stout heart , and to postpone the meal he craved till the following morning . night came , and passepartout re - entered the native quarter , where he wandered through the streets , lit by vari - coloured lanterns , looking on at the dancers , who were executing skilful steps and boundings , and the astrologers who stood in the open air with their telescopes . then he came to the harbour , which was lit up by the resin torches of the fishermen , who were fishing from their boats .",240

"after about two years , an odd circumstance presented itself , which put the old thought of making some attempt for my liberty again in my head . my patron lying at home longer than usual without fitting out his ship , which , as i heard , was for want of money , he used constantly , once or twice a week , sometimes oftener if the weather was fair , to take the ship ’s pinnace and go out into the road a - fishing ; and as he always took me and young maresco with him to row the boat , we made him very merry , and i proved very dexterous in catching fish ; insomuch that sometimes he would send me with a moor , one of his kinsmen , and the youth — the maresco , as they called him — to catch a dish of fish for him .",102

"i was near two months performing this last work , viz . rigging and fitting my masts and sails ; for i finished them very complete , making a small stay , and a sail , or foresail , to it , to assist if we should turn to windward ; and , what was more than all , i fixed a rudder to the stern of her to steer with . i was but a bungling shipwright , yet as i knew the usefulness and even necessity of such a thing , i applied myself with so much pains to do it , that at last i brought it to pass ; though , considering the many dull contrivances i had for it that failed , i think it cost me almost as much labour as making the boat .",139
"in the meanwhile the boat - building progressed , and towards the end of the month half the planking was completed .",4
"it was just at high - water when these people came on shore ; and while they rambled about to see what kind of a place they were in , they had carelessly stayed till the tide was spent , and the water was ebbed considerably away , leaving their boat aground . they had left two men in the boat , who , as i found afterwards , having drunk a little too much brandy , fell asleep ; however , one of them waking a little sooner than the other and finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it , hallooed out for the rest , who were straggling about : upon which they all soon came to the boat : but it was past all their strength to launch her , the boat being very heavy , and the shore on that side being a soft oozy sand , almost like a quicksand . in this condition , like true seamen , who are , perhaps , the least of all mankind given to forethought , they gave it over , and away they strolled about the country again ; and i heard one of them say aloud to another , calling them off from the boat , “ why , let her alone , jack , ca n’t you ? she ’ll float next tide ; ” by which i was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of what countrymen they were .",60

"while this was doing , i sent friday with the captain ’s mate to the boat with orders to secure her , and bring away the oars and sails , which they did ; and by - and - by three straggling men , that were ( happily for them ) parted from the rest , came back upon hearing the guns fired ; and seeing the captain , who was before their prisoner , now their conqueror , they submitted to be bound also ; and so our victory was complete .",15
"some time after this , the boat was ordered on shore , the tide being up , with the things promised to the men ; to which the captain , at my intercession , caused their chests and clothes to be added , which they took , and were very thankful for . i also encouraged them , by telling them that if it lay in my power to send any vessel to take them in , i would not forget them .",6
"when i took leave of this island , i carried on board , for relics , the great goat - skin cap i had made , my umbrella , and one of my parrots ; also , i forgot not to take the money i formerly mentioned , which had lain by me so long useless that it was grown rusty or tarnished , and could hardly pass for silver till it had been a little rubbed and handled , as also the money i found in the wreck of the spanish ship . and thus i left the island , the 19th of december , as i found by the ship ’s account , in the year 1686 , after i had been upon it eight - and - twenty years , two months , and nineteen days ; being delivered from this second captivity the same day of the month that i first made my escape in the long - boat from among the moors of sallee . in this vessel , after a long voyage , i arrived in england the 11th of june , in the year 1687 , having been thirty - five years absent .",162
""" me , i 'm out like a light ! "" ned land replied . my two companions lay down on the cabin 's carpeting and were soon deep in slumber . as for me , i gave in less readily to this intense need for sleep . too many thoughts had piled up in my mind , too many insoluble questions had arisen , too many images were keeping my eyelids open ! where were we ? what strange power was carrying us along ? i felt -- or at least i thought i did -- the submersible sinking toward the sea 's lower strata . intense nightmares besieged me . in these mysterious marine sanctuaries , i envisioned hosts of unknown animals , and this underwater boat seemed to be a blood relation of theirs : living , breathing , just as fearsome . . . ! then my mind grew calmer , my imagination melted into hazy drowsiness , and i soon fell into an uneasy slumber .",128
"so it was now urgent to renew the air in our prison , and no doubt the air in this whole underwater boat as well .",22
"the engineer , aided by his companions , including pencroft , who was once more obliged to leave his boat , commenced the preliminary operations , the subject of which was to rid the wool of that fat and oily substance with which it is impregnated , and which is called grease .",19
"the severe cold began to be felt about the 20th of june , and , to his great regret , pencroft was obliged to suspend his boat - building , which he hoped to finish in time for next spring .",26
"the rangoon -- one of the peninsular and oriental company 's boats plying in the chinese and japanese seas -- was a screw steamer , built of iron , weighing about seventeen hundred and seventy tons , and with engines of four hundred horse - power . she was as fast , but not as well fitted up , as the mongolia , and aouda was not as comfortably provided for on board of her as phileas fogg could have wished . however , the trip from calcutta to hong kong only comprised some three thousand five hundred miles , occupying from ten to twelve days , and the young woman was not difficult to please .",11
