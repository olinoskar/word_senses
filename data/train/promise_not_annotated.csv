"our breakfast - table was cleared early , and holmes waited in his dressing - gown for the promised interview . our clients were punctual to their appointment , for the clock had just struck ten when dr . mortimer was shown up , followed by the young baronet . the latter was a small , alert , dark - eyed man about thirty years of age , very sturdily built , with thick black eyebrows and a strong , pugnacious face . he wore a ruddy - tinted tweed suit and had the weather - beaten appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air , and yet there was something in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated the gentleman .",18

"as for captain nemo , i wondered what he would make of our escaping , what concern or perhaps what distress it might cause him , and what he would do in the twofold event of our attempt either failing or being found out ! certainly i had no complaints to register with him , on the contrary . never was hospitality more wholehearted than his . yet in leaving him i could n't be accused of ingratitude . no solemn promises bound us to him . in order to keep us captive , he had counted only on the force of circumstances and not on our word of honor . but his avowed intention to imprison us forever on his ship justified our every effort .",81

"some thirty pictures by the masters , uniformly framed and separated by gleaming panoplies of arms , adorned walls on which were stretched tapestries of austere design . there i saw canvases of the highest value , the likes of which i had marveled at in private european collections and art exhibitions . the various schools of the old masters were represented by a raphael madonna , a virgin by leonardo da vinci , a nymph by correggio , a woman by titian , an adoration of the magi by veronese , an assumption of the virgin by murillo , a holbein portrait , a monk by velazquez , a martyr by ribera , a village fair by rubens , two flemish landscapes by teniers , three little genre paintings by gerard dow , metsu , and paul potter , two canvases by gericault and prud'hon , plus seascapes by backhuysen and vernet . among the works of modern art were pictures signed by delacroix , ingres , decamps , troyon , meissonier , daubigny , etc . , and some wonderful miniature statues in marble or bronze , modeled after antiquity 's finest originals , stood on their pedestals in the corners of this magnificent museum . as the nautilus 's commander had predicted , my mind was already starting to fall into that promised state of stunned amazement .",225

"so ned land had good reason to worry . in these wide seas empty of islands , it was no longer feasible to jump ship . nor did we have any way to counter captain nemo 's whims . we had no choice but to acquiesce ; but if we could n't attain our end through force or cunning , i liked to think we might achieve it through persuasion . once this voyage was over , might not captain nemo consent to set us free in return for our promise never to reveal his existence ? our word of honor , which we sincerely would have kept . however , this delicate question would have to be negotiated with the captain . but how would he receive our demands for freedom ? at the very outset and in no uncertain terms , had n't he declared that the secret of his life required that we be permanently imprisoned on board the nautilus ? would n't he see my four - month silence as a tacit acceptance of this situation ? would my returning to this subject arouse suspicions that could jeopardize our escape plans , if we had promising circumstances for trying again later on ? i weighed all these considerations , turned them over in my mind , submitted them to conseil , but he was as baffled as i was . in short , although i 'm not easily discouraged , i realized that my chances of ever seeing my fellow men again were shrinking by the day , especially at a time when captain nemo was recklessly racing toward the south atlantic !",90
