"when the nautilus returned to the surface of the ocean , i could take in reao island over its whole flat , wooded expanse . obviously its madreporic rocks had been made fertile by tornadoes and thunderstorms . one day , carried off by a hurricane from neighboring shores , some seed fell onto these limestone beds , mixing with decomposed particles of fish and marine plants to form vegetable humus . propelled by the waves , a coconut arrived on this new coast . its germ took root . its tree grew tall , catching steam off the water . a brook was born . little by little , vegetation spread . tiny animals -- worms , insects -- rode ashore on tree trunks snatched from islands to windward . turtles came to lay their eggs . birds nested in the young trees . in this way animal life developed , and drawn by the greenery and fertile soil , man appeared . and that 's how these islands were formed , the immense achievement of microscopic animals .",9

"in fact , there beneath my eyes was a town in ruins , demolished , overwhelmed , laid low , its roofs caved in , its temples pulled down , its arches dislocated , its columns stretching over the earth ; in these ruins you could still detect the solid proportions of a sort of tuscan architecture ; farther off , the remains of a gigantic aqueduct ; here , the caked heights of an acropolis along with the fluid forms of a parthenon ; there , the remnants of a wharf , as if some bygone port had long ago harbored merchant vessels and triple - tiered war galleys on the shores of some lost ocean ; still farther off , long rows of collapsing walls , deserted thoroughfares , a whole pompeii buried under the waters , which captain nemo had resurrected before my eyes !",116

"by then we were forced to go back down to the beach because the ridge had become impossible . above us , the yawning crater looked like the wide mouth of a well . from where we stood , the sky was pretty easy to see , and i watched clouds race by , disheveled by the west wind , letting tatters of mist trail over the mountain 's summit . proof positive that those clouds kept at a moderate altitude , because this volcano did n't rise more than 1,800 feet above the level of the ocean .",97

"we did n't leave these patagonian waterways until april 3 , sometimes cruising under the ocean , sometimes on its surface . the nautilus passed the wide estuary formed by the mouth of the rio de la plata , and on april 4 we lay abreast of uruguay , albeit fifty miles out . keeping to its northerly heading , it followed the long windings of south america . by then we had fared 16,000 leagues since coming on board in the seas of japan .",15

"on november 26 , at three o'clock in the morning , the nautilus cleared the tropic of cancer at longitude 172 degrees . on the 27th it passed in sight of the hawaiian islands , where the famous captain cook met his death on february 14 , 1779 . by then we had fared 4,860 leagues from our starting point . when i arrived on the platform that morning , i saw the island of hawaii two miles to leeward , the largest of the seven islands making up this group . i could clearly distinguish the tilled soil on its outskirts , the various mountain chains running parallel with its coastline , and its volcanoes , crowned by mauna kea , whose elevation is 5,000 meters above sea level . among other specimens from these waterways , our nets brought up some peacock - tailed flabellarian coral , polyps flattened into stylish shapes and unique to this part of the ocean .",161
"it was during the night of december 9 - 10 that the nautilus encountered this army of distinctly nocturnal mollusks . they numbered in the millions . they were migrating from the temperate zones toward zones still warmer , following the itineraries of herring and sardines . we stared at them through our thick glass windows : they swam backward with tremendous speed , moving by means of their locomotive tubes , chasing fish and mollusks , eating the little ones , eaten by the big ones , and tossing in indescribable confusion the ten feet that nature has rooted in their heads like a hairpiece of pneumatic snakes . despite its speed , the nautilus navigated for several hours in the midst of this school of animals , and its nets brought up an incalculable number , among which i recognized all nine species that professor orbigny has classified as native to the pacific ocean .",155
"during the day of december 11 , i was busy reading in the main lounge . ned land and conseil were observing the luminous waters through the gaping panels . the nautilus was motionless . its ballast tanks full , it was sitting at a depth of 1,000 meters in a comparatively unpopulated region of the ocean where only larger fish put in occasional appearances .",56
"i 'll mention chiefly some trunkfish unique to the red sea , the sea of the east indies , and that part of the ocean washing the coasts of equinoctial america . like turtles , armadillos , sea urchins , and crustaceans , these fish are protected by armor plate that 's neither chalky nor stony but actual bone . sometimes this armor takes the shape of a solid triangle , sometimes that of a solid quadrangle . among the triangular type , i noticed some half a decimeter long , with brown tails , yellow fins , and wholesome , exquisitely tasty flesh ; i even recommend that they be acclimatized to fresh water , a change , incidentally , that a number of saltwater fish can make with ease . i 'll also mention some quadrangular trunkfish topped by four large protuberances along the back ; trunkfish sprinkled with white spots on the underside of the body , which make good house pets like certain birds ; boxfish armed with stings formed by extensions of their bony crusts , and whose odd grunting has earned them the nickname "" sea pigs "" ; then some trunkfish known as dromedaries , with tough , leathery flesh and big conical humps .",24

"in the midst of the watery mass , brightly lit by our electric beams , there snaked past those one - meter lampreys that are common to nearly every clime . a type of ray from the genus oxyrhynchus , five feet wide , had a white belly with a spotted , ash - gray back and was carried along by the currents like a huge , wide - open shawl . other rays passed by so quickly i could n't tell if they deserved that name "" eagle ray "" coined by the ancient greeks , or those designations of "" rat ray , "" "" bat ray , "" and "" toad ray "" that modern fishermen have inflicted on them . dogfish known as topes , twelve feet long and especially feared by divers , were racing with each other . looking like big bluish shadows , thresher sharks went by , eight feet long and gifted with an extremely acute sense of smell . dorados from the genus sparus , some measuring up to thirteen decimeters , appeared in silver and azure costumes encircled with ribbons , which contrasted with the dark color of their fins ; fish sacred to the goddess venus , their eyes set in brows of gold ; a valuable species that patronizes all waters fresh or salt , equally at home in rivers , lakes , and oceans , living in every clime , tolerating any temperature , their line dating back to prehistoric times on this earth yet preserving all its beauty from those far - off days . magnificent sturgeons , nine to ten meters long and extremely fast , banged their powerful tails against the glass of our panels , showing bluish backs with small brown spots ; they resemble sharks , without equaling their strength , and are encountered in every sea ; in the spring they delight in swimming up the great rivers , fighting the currents of the volga , danube , po , rhine , loire , and oder , while feeding on herring , mackerel , salmon , and codfish ; although they belong to the class of cartilaginous fish , they rate as a delicacy ; they 're eaten fresh , dried , marinated , or salt - preserved , and in olden times they were borne in triumph to the table of the roman epicure lucullus . but whenever the nautilus drew near the surface , those denizens of the mediterranean i could observe most productively belonged to the sixty - third genus of bony fish . these were tuna from the genus scomber , blue - black on top , silver on the belly armor , their dorsal stripes giving off a golden gleam . they are said to follow ships in search of refreshing shade from the hot tropical sun , and they did just that with the nautilus , as they had once done with the vessels of the count de la pérouse . for long hours they competed in speed with our submersible . i could n't stop marveling at these animals so perfectly cut out for racing , their heads small , their bodies sleek , spindle - shaped , and in some cases over three meters long , their pectoral fins gifted with remarkable strength , their caudal fins forked . like certain flocks of birds , whose speed they equal , these tuna swim in triangle formation , which prompted the ancients to say they 'd boned up on geometry and military strategy . and yet they ca n't escape the provençal fishermen , who prize them as highly as did the ancient inhabitants of turkey and italy ; and these valuable animals , as oblivious as if they were deaf and blind , leap right into the marseilles tuna nets and perish by the thousands .",236
"madrepores , which one must guard against confusing with precious coral , clothe their tissue in a limestone crust , and their variations in structure have led my famous mentor professor milne - edwards to classify them into five divisions . the tiny microscopic animals that secrete this polypary live by the billions in the depths of their cells . their limestone deposits build up into rocks , reefs , islets , islands . in some places , they form atolls , a circular ring surrounding a lagoon or small inner lake that gaps place in contact with the sea . elsewhere , they take the shape of barrier reefs , such as those that exist along the coasts of new caledonia and several of the tuamotu islands . in still other localities , such as réunion island and the island of mauritius , they build fringing reefs , high , straight walls next to which the ocean 's depth is considerable .",157
