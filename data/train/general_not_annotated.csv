""" oh , gracious , mama ! spare us the enumeration ! _ au reste _ , we all know them : danger of bad example to innocence of childhood ; distractions and consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached -- mutual alliance and reliance ; confidence thence resulting -- insolence accompanying -- mutiny and general blow - up .",58

"the name of liedenbrock was honourably mentioned in colleges and learned societies . humphry davy , [ 2 ] humboldt , captain sir john franklin , general sabine , never failed to call upon him on their way through hamburg . becquerel , ebelman , brewster , dumas , milne - edwards , saint - claire - deville frequently consulted him upon the most difficult problems in chemistry , a science which was indebted to him for considerable discoveries , for in 1853 there had appeared at leipzig an imposing folio by otto liedenbrock , entitled , "" a treatise upon transcendental chemistry , "" with plates ; a work , however , which failed to cover its expenses .",26

"mm bassompierre and schomberg were marshals of france , and claimed their right of commanding the army under the orders of the king ; but the cardinal , who feared that bassompierre , a huguenot at heart , might press but feebly the english and rochellais , his brothers in religion , supported the duc dâ€™angouleme , whom the king , at his instigation , had named lieutenant general .",68
"under my eyes i had the excellent charts of the torres strait that had been surveyed and drawn up by the hydrographic engineer vincendon dumoulin and sublieutenant ( now admiral ) coupvent - desbois , who were part of dumont d'urville 's general staff during his final voyage to circumnavigate the globe . these , along with the efforts of captain king , are the best charts for untangling the snarl of this narrow passageway , and i consulted them with scrupulous care . around the nautilus the sea was boiling furiously . a stream of waves , bearing from southeast to northwest at a speed of two and a half miles per hour , broke over heads of coral emerging here and there .",42

"mr . fogg was quite ready . under his arm might have been observed a red - bound copy of bradshaw 's continental railway steam transit and general guide , with its timetables showing the arrival and departure of steamers and railways . he took the carpet - bag , opened it , and slipped into it a goodly roll of bank of england notes , which would pass wherever he might go .",27
"side by side , captain nemo and i walked directly toward this conspicuous flame . the level seafloor rose imperceptibly . we took long strides , helped by our alpenstocks ; but in general our progress was slow , because our feet kept sinking into a kind of slimy mud mixed with seaweed and assorted flat stones .",33

"my uncle took the piece of meat and the few biscuits which had escaped from the general destruction . he divided them into three equal portions and gave one to each . this made about a pound of nourishment for each . the professor ate his greedily , with a kind of feverish rage . i ate without pleasure , almost with disgust ; hans quietly , moderately , masticating his small mouthfuls without any noise , and relishing them with the calmness of a man above all anxiety about the future . by diligent search he had found a flask of hollands ; he offered it to us each in turn , and this generous beverage cheered us up slightly .",16

"the baron chanced to come by ; he beheld the cause and effect , and , without hesitation , saluted candide with some notable kicks on the breech and drove him out of doors . the lovely miss cunegund fainted away , and , as soon as she came to herself , the baroness boxed her ears . thus a general consternation was spread over this most magnificent and most agreeable of all possible castles .",60

"in fact , the sack of la rochelle , and the assassination of three of four thousand huguenots who allowed themselves to be killed , would resemble too closely , in 1628 , the massacre of st . bartholomew in 1572 ; and then , above all this , this extreme measure , which was not at all repugnant to the king , good catholic as he was , always fell before this argument of the besieging generals -- la rochelle is impregnable except to famine .",77

"i attach a print of the positive . in it you can view these primordial rocks that have never seen the light of day , this nether granite that forms the powerful foundation of our globe , the deep caves cut into the stony mass , the outlines of incomparable distinctness whose far edges stand out in black as if from the brush of certain flemish painters . in the distance is a mountainous horizon , a wondrously undulating line that makes up the background of this landscape . the general effect of these smooth rocks is indescribable : black , polished , without moss or other blemish , carved into strange shapes , sitting firmly on a carpet of sand that sparkled beneath our streams of electric light .",90
"everybody knows that the great reversed triangle of land , with its base in the north and its apex in the south , which is called india , embraces fourteen hundred thousand square miles , upon which is spread unequally a population of one hundred and eighty millions of souls . the british crown exercises a real and despotic dominion over the larger portion of this vast country , and has a governor - general stationed at calcutta , governors at madras , bombay , and in bengal , and a lieutenant - governor at agra .",74

"phileas fogg had not concealed from sir francis his design of going round the world , nor the circumstances under which he set out ; and the general only saw in the wager a useless eccentricity and a lack of sound common sense . in the way this strange gentleman was going on , he would leave the world without having done any good to himself or anybody else .",27
"the train entered the defiles of the sutpour mountains , which separate the khandeish from bundelcund , towards evening . the next day sir francis cromarty asked passepartout what time it was ; to which , on consulting his watch , he replied that it was three in the morning . this famous timepiece , always regulated on the greenwich meridian , which was now some seventy - seven degrees westward , was at least four hours slow . sir francis corrected passepartout 's time , whereupon the latter made the same remark that he had done to fix ; and upon the general insisting that the watch should be regulated in each new meridian , since he was constantly going eastward , that is in the face of the sun , and therefore the days were shorter by four minutes for each degree gone over , passepartout obstinately refused to alter his watch , which he kept at london time . it was an innocent delusion which could harm no one .",103
phileas fogg looked at sir francis cromarty for an explanation ; but the general could not tell what meant a halt in the midst of this forest of dates and acacias .,13
"the steamer which was about to depart from yokohama to san francisco belonged to the pacific mail steamship company , and was named the general grant . she was a large paddle - wheel steamer of two thousand five hundred tons ; well equipped and very fast . the massive walking - beam rose and fell above the deck ; at one end a piston - rod worked up and down ; and at the other was a connecting - rod which , in changing the rectilinear motion to a circular one , was directly connected with the shaft of the paddles . the general grant was rigged with three masts , giving a large capacity for sails , and thus materially aiding the steam power . by making twelve miles an hour , she would cross the ocean in twenty - one days . phileas fogg was therefore justified in hoping that he would reach san francisco by the 2nd of december , new york by the 11th , and london on the 20th -- thus gaining several hours on the fatal date of the 21st of december .",24

"on the ninth day after leaving yokohama , phileas fogg had traversed exactly one half of the terrestrial globe . the general grant passed , on the 23rd of november , the one hundred and eightieth meridian , and was at the very antipodes of london . mr . fogg had , it is true , exhausted fifty - two of the eighty days in which he was to complete the tour , and there were only twenty - eight left . but , though he was only half - way by the difference of meridians , he had really gone over two - thirds of the whole journey ; for he had been obliged to make long circuits from london to aden , from aden to bombay , from calcutta to singapore , and from singapore to yokohama . could he have followed without deviation the fiftieth parallel , which is that of london , the whole distance would only have been about twelve thousand miles ; whereas he would be forced , by the irregular methods of locomotion , to traverse twenty - six thousand , of which he had , on the 23rd of november , accomplished seventeen thousand five hundred . and now the course was a straight one , and fix was no longer there to put obstacles in their way !",21

"dâ€™artagnan thought of the appointment mme . bonacieux had made with him for that very evening ; but we are bound to say , to the credit of our hero , that the bad opinion entertained by m. de treville of women in general , did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty hostess .",43

"ten hearers only were now left , among them honest passepartout , who was listening with all his ears . thus he learned that , after long persecutions , smith reappeared in illinois , and in 1839 founded a community at nauvoo , on the mississippi , numbering twenty - five thousand souls , of which he became mayor , chief justice , and general - in - chief ; that he announced himself , in 1843 , as a candidate for the presidency of the united states ; and that finally , being drawn into ambuscade at carthage , he was thrown into prison , and assassinated by a band of men disguised in masks .",64

"as she said these words her foot slipped , and in another moment , splash ! she was up to her chin in salt water . her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea , ' and in that case i can go back by railway , ' she said to herself .
