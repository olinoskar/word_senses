"the one which had been seized in the hall of granite house was a great fellow , six feet high , with an admirably poportioned frame , a broad chest , head of a moderate size , the facial angle reaching sixty - five degrees , round skull , projecting nose , skin covered with soft glossy hair , in short , a fine specimen of the anthropoids .",49

"the return to the plateau of prospect heights would , therefore , be followed by extensive agricultural labors , interrupted only by the projected expedition through the island .",23
"to accompany him down the long , narrow , dark passage , would have been impossible . therefore , we followed , as he bid us . the building was constructed of roughly squared timbers , with rooms on both sides , four in number , all opening out into the one passage : these were the kitchen , the weaving shop , the badstofa , or family sleeping - room , and the visitors ' room , which was the best of all . my uncle , whose height had not been thought of in building the house , of course hit his head several times against the beams that projected from the ceilings .",111
"and so we arrived at a place where the shore was much narrowed . here the sea came to lap the foot of the steep cliff , leaving a passage no wider than a couple of yards . between two boldly projecting rocks appeared the mouth of a dark tunnel .",41
"nothing could be easier than to execute this project , and this is how the engineer intended to set to work . the plateau was already defended on three sides by water - courses , either artificial or natural .",8
"however , as a precautionary measure , pencroft did not as yet allow him complete liberty , rightly wishing to wait until the limits of the plateau should be settled by the projected works .",32

"snæfell is 5,000 feet high . its double cone forms the limit of a trachytic belt which stands out distinctly in the mountain system of the island . from our starting point we could see the two peaks boldly projected against the dark grey sky ; i could see an enormous cap of snow coming low down upon the giant 's brow .",39
"the stranger advanced slowly , and as he advanced , after entering into the circle of light projected by the lamp , milady involuntarily drew back .",17

"that sharp peak might hence be considered as the gnomon of a vast sun dial , the shadow projected from which on a certain day would point out the road to the centre of the earth .",18
"the time was , therefore , very favorable for the projected expedition , which , if it did not accomplish its principal object , would at any rate be fruitful in discoveries , especially of natural productions , since harding proposed to explore those dense forests of the far west , which stretched to the extremity of the serpentine peninsula .",10
"cyrus harding informed ayrton of the projected expedition , and proposed that he should take part in it , but ayrton preferring to remain on shore , it was decided that he should come to granite house during the absence of his companions .",6

"there was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of influence . no other activity was like it . to project one 's soul into some gracious form , and let it tarry there for a moment ; to hear one 's own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of passion and youth ; to convey one 's temperament into another as though it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume : there was a real joy in that -- perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited and vulgar as our own , an age grossly carnal in its pleasures , and grossly common in its aims ....",19
"did fix pay any attention to passepartout 's trouble about the gas ? it is not probable . he was not listening , but was cogitating a project . passepartout and he had now reached the shop , where fix left his companion to make his purchases , after recommending him not to miss the steamer , and hurried back to the consulate . now that he was fully convinced , fix had quite recovered his equanimity .",27

"looking down on this very scene , there stood upon the fourth of may , eighteen hundred and forty - seven , a solitary traveller . his appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region . an observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty . his face was lean and haggard , and the brown parchment - like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones ; his long , brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white ; his eyes were sunken in his head , and burned with an unnatural lustre ; while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton . as he stood , he leaned upon his weapon for support , and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution . his gaunt face , however , and his clothes , which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs , proclaimed what it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance . the man was dying — dying from hunger and from thirst .",82
""" that is one of the points upon which your own researches have shed a light . your interview with the lady has cleared the situation very much . i did not know about a projected divorce between herself and her husband . in that case , regarding stapleton as an unmarried man , she counted no doubt upon becoming his wife .

""" professor , you know as well as i do that a man can live underwater so long as he carries with him his own supply of breathable air . for underwater work projects , the workman wears a waterproof suit with his head imprisoned in a metal capsule , while he receives air from above by means of force pumps and flow regulators .
