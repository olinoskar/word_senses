"had he travelled ? it was likely , for no one seemed to know the world more familiarly ; there was no spot so secluded that he did not appear to have an intimate acquaintance with it . he often corrected , with a few clear words , the thousand conjectures advanced by members of the club as to lost and unheard - of travellers , pointing out the true probabilities , and seeming as if gifted with a sort of second sight , so often did events justify his predictions . he must have travelled everywhere , at least in the spirit .",51
""" but now , my dear cyrus , all this industrial and commercial movement to which you predict a continual advance , does it not run the danger of being sooner or later completely stopped ? """,20
"we knew all these details , but we were not aware that since our departure the question had advanced to farther stages . other similar maxillaries , though belonging to individuals of various types and different nations , were found in the loose grey soil of certain grottoes in france , switzerland , and belgium , as well as weapons , tools , earthen utensils , bones of children and adults . the existence therefore of man in the quaternary period seemed to become daily more certain .",18
"after clearing the outer belt of rocks via a narrow passageway , the nautilus lay inside the breakers where the sea had a depth of thirty to forty fathoms . under the green shade of some tropical evergreens , i spotted a few savages who looked extremely startled at our approach . in this long , blackish object advancing flush with the water , did n't they see some fearsome cetacean that they were obliged to view with distrust ?",58
"and so it turned out . the nautilus took full advantage of this countercurrent . it advanced swiftly through this narrow passageway . for an instant i could glimpse the wonderful ruins of the temple of hercules , buried undersea , as pliny and avianus have mentioned , together with the flat island they stand on ; and a few minutes later , we were floating on the waves of the atlantic .",16
"yet this part of the province , at a very small distance from the capital , is reckoned among the inhabited and cultivated portions of iceland . what , then , must other tracts be , more desert than this desert ? in the first half mile we had not seen one farmer standing before his cabin door , nor one shepherd tending a flock less wild than himself , nothing but a few cows and sheep left to themselves . what then would be those convulsed regions upon which we were advancing , regions subject to the dire phenomena of eruptions , the offspring of volcanic explosions and subterranean convulsions ?",92
"but i did not advance this argument . my uncle would have met it with his inevitable saknussemm , a precedent which possessed no weight with me ; for even if the journey of the learned icelander were really attested , there was one very simple answer , that in the sixteenth century there was neither barometer or aneroid and therefore saknussemm could not tell how far he had gone .",4

"we had long lost sight of the sea shore behind the hills of bones . the rash professor , careless of losing his way , hurried me forward . we advanced in silence , bathed in luminous electric fluid . by some phenomenon which i am unable to explain , it lighted up all sides of every object equally . such was its diffusiveness , there being no central point from which the light emanated , that shadows no longer existed . you might have thought yourself under the rays of a vertical sun in a tropical region at noonday and the height of summer . no vapour was visible . the rocks , the distant mountains , a few isolated clumps of forest trees in the distance , presented a weird and wonderful aspect under these totally new conditions of a universal diffusion of light . we were like hoffmann 's shadowless man .",30
