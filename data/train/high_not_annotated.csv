"i estimate that this cast of the net brought in more than 1,000 pounds of fish . it was a fine catch but not surprising . in essence , these nets stayed in our wake for several hours , incarcerating an entire aquatic world in prisons made of thread . so we were never lacking in provisions of the highest quality , which the nautilus 's speed and the allure of its electric light could continually replenish .",59
"about 300 meters down , just as captain nemo had predicted , we cruised beneath the undulating surface of the ice bank . but the nautilus sank deeper still . it reached a depth of 800 meters . at the surface this water gave a temperature of -12 degrees centigrade , but now it gave no more than -10 degrees . two degrees had already been gained . thanks to its heating equipment , the nautilus 's temperature , needless to say , stayed at a much higher degree . every maneuver was accomplished with extraordinary precision .",87
"her face was like her mother 's ; a youthful unfurrowed likeness : the same low brow , the same high features , the same pride . it was not , however , so saturnine a pride ! she laughed continually ; her laugh was satirical , and so was the habitual expression of her arched and haughty lip .",20
"among the fish that the nautilus startled on its way , i 'll mention a one - meter lumpfish , blackish on top with orange on the belly and rare among its brethren in that it practices monogamy , a good - sized eelpout , a type of emerald moray whose flavor is excellent , wolffish with big eyes in a head somewhat resembling a canine 's , viviparous blennies whose eggs hatch inside their bodies like those of snakes , bloated gobio ( or black gudgeon ) measuring two decimeters , grenadiers with long tails and gleaming with a silvery glow , speedy fish venturing far from their high arctic seas .",109
such high spirits as these were rather too strong .,1
"no . a jolt told me that the nautilus had bumped the underbelly of the ice bank , still quite thick to judge from the hollowness of the accompanying noise . indeed , we had "" struck bottom , "" to use nautical terminology , but in the opposite direction and at a depth of 3,000 feet . that gave us 4,000 feet of ice overhead , of which 1,000 feet emerged above water . so the ice bank was higher here than we had found it on the outskirts . a circumstance less than encouraging .",80
""" salts , "" he said , "" fill the sea in considerable quantities , professor , and if you removed all its dissolved saline content , you 'd create a mass measuring 4,500,000 cubic leagues , which if it were spread all over the globe , would form a layer more than ten meters high . and do n't think that the presence of these salts is due merely to some whim of nature . no . they make ocean water less open to evaporation and prevent winds from carrying off excessive amounts of steam , which , when condensing , would submerge the temperate zones . salts play a leading role , the role of stabilizer for the general ecology of the globe !

"by july 23 the great eastern was lying no farther than 800 kilometers from newfoundland when it received telegraphed news from ireland of an armistice signed between prussia and austria after the battle of sadova . through the mists on the 27th , it sighted the port of heart 's content . the undertaking had ended happily , and in its first dispatch , young america addressed old europe with these wise words so rarely understood : "" glory to god in the highest , and peace on earth to men of good will . """,83
"there the ocean floor formed a valley 120 kilometers wide , into which you could fit mt . blanc without its summit poking above the surface of the waves . this valley is closed off to the east by a sheer wall 2,000 meters high . we arrived there on may 28 , and the nautilus lay no farther than 150 kilometers from ireland . would captain nemo head up north and beach us on the british isles ? no . much to my surprise , he went back down south and returned to european seas . as we swung around the emerald isle , i spotted cape clear for an instant , plus the lighthouse on fastnet rock that guides all those thousands of ships setting out from glasgow or liverpool .",44
at low tide they overhauled the hold -- at high tide they stowed away the rescued articles .,9
"in an hour we had reached the islet . two hours later we had completed a full circle around it . it measured four to five miles in circumference . a narrow channel separated it from a considerable shore , perhaps a continent whose limits we could n't see . the existence of this shore seemed to bear out commander maury 's hypotheses . in essence , this ingenious american has noted that between the south pole and the 60th parallel , the sea is covered with floating ice of dimensions much greater than any found in the north atlantic . from this fact he drew the conclusion that the antarctic circle must contain considerable shores , since icebergs ca n't form on the high seas but only along coastlines . according to his calculations , this frozen mass enclosing the southernmost pole forms a vast ice cap whose width must reach 4,000 kilometers .",124
"many citizens , seeing the women flying toward the high street , leaving their children crying at the open doors , hastened to don the cuirass , and supporting their somewhat uncertain courage with a musket or a partisan , directed their steps toward the hostelry of the jolly miller , before which was gathered , increasing every minute , a compact group , vociferous and full of curiosity .",9
""" to be good is to be in harmony with one 's self , "" he replied , touching the thin stem of his glass with his pale , fine - pointed fingers . "" discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others . one 's own life -- that is the important thing . as for the lives of one 's neighbours , if one wishes to be a prig or a puritan , one can flaunt one 's moral views about them , but they are not one 's concern . besides , individualism has really the higher aim . modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one 's age . i consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality .

""" it is all very well for the present , "" said he ; "" but seriously , i trust that when the first flush of vivacity is over , you will look a little higher than domestic endearments and household joys . """,35
"it was scarcely probable that they would find the box , which the waves had rolled about among the pebbles , at high tide , but it was as well to try .",22
"but as beautiful as it was , i could get only a quick look at this basin whose surface area comprises 2,000,000 square kilometers . even captain nemo 's personal insights were denied me , because that mystifying individual did n't appear one single time during our high - speed crossing . i estimate that the nautilus covered a track of some 600 leagues under the waves of this sea , and this voyage was accomplished in just twenty - four hours times two . departing from the waterways of greece on the morning of february 16 , we cleared the strait of gibraltar by sunrise on the 18th .",47

"1 . an eigel 's centigrade thermometer , graduated up to 150 degrees ( 302 degrees fahr . ) , which seemed to me too much or too little . too much if the internal heat was to rise so high , for in this case we should be baked , not enough to measure the temperature of springs or any matter in a state of fusion .",40

"madrepores , which one must guard against confusing with precious coral , clothe their tissue in a limestone crust , and their variations in structure have led my famous mentor professor milne - edwards to classify them into five divisions . the tiny microscopic animals that secrete this polypary live by the billions in the depths of their cells . their limestone deposits build up into rocks , reefs , islets , islands . in some places , they form atolls , a circular ring surrounding a lagoon or small inner lake that gaps place in contact with the sea . elsewhere , they take the shape of barrier reefs , such as those that exist along the coasts of new caledonia and several of the tuamotu islands . in still other localities , such as r√©union island and the island of mauritius , they build fringing reefs , high , straight walls next to which the ocean 's depth is considerable .",149
