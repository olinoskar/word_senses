"but i could n't linger . captain nemo , on familiar terms with these dreadful animals , no longer minded them . we arrived at a preliminary plateau where still other surprises were waiting for me . there picturesque ruins took shape , betraying the hand of man , not our creator . they were huge stacks of stones in which you could distinguish the indistinct forms of palaces and temples , now arrayed in hosts of blossoming zoophytes , and over it all , not ivy but a heavy mantle of algae and fucus plants .",14,"('dreadful', 'terrible', 'terrible')",1

"and if nothing happens without his knowledge , he knows that i am here , and am in this dreadful condition ; and if nothing happens without his appointment , he has appointed all this to befall me . nothing occurred to my thought to contradict any of these conclusions , and therefore it rested upon me with the greater force , that it must needs be that god had appointed all this to befall me ; that i was brought into this miserable circumstance by his direction , he having the sole power , not of me only , but of everything that happened in the world . immediately it followed : why has god done this to me ? what have i done to be thus used ? my conscience presently checked me in that inquiry , as if i had blasphemed , and methought it spoke to me like a voice : “ wretch ! dost _ thou _ ask what thou hast done ? look back upon a dreadful misspent life , and ask thyself what thou hast _ not _ done ? ask , why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed ? why wert thou not drowned in yarmouth roads ; killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the sallee man - of - war ; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of africa ; or drowned _ here _ , when all the crew perished but thyself ? dost _ thou _ ask , what have i done ? ” i was struck dumb with these reflections , as one astonished , and had not a word to say — no , not to answer to myself , but rose up pensive and sad , walked back to my retreat , and went up over my wall , as if i had been going to bed ; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed , and i had no inclination to sleep ; so i sat down in my chair , and lighted my lamp , for it began to be dark . now , as the apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me very much , it occurred to my thought that the brazilians take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers , and i had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests , which was quite cured , and some also that was green , and not quite cured .",19,"('dreadful', 'affreux', 'terrible')",3

"at ten o'clock in the evening , the skies caught on fire . the air was streaked with violent flashes of lightning . i could n't stand this brightness , but captain nemo stared straight at it , as if to inhale the spirit of the storm . a dreadful noise filled the air , a complicated noise made up of the roar of crashing breakers , the howl of the wind , claps of thunder . the wind shifted to every point of the horizon , and the cyclone left the east to return there after passing through north , west , and south , moving in the opposite direction of revolving storms in the southern hemisphere .",49,"('dreadful', 'terrible', 'terrible')",1
