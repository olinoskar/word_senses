"i waited till the last deep and full vibration had expired -- till the tide of talk , checked an instant , had resumed its flow ; i then quitted my sheltered corner and made my exit by the side - door , which was fortunately near .",32
"i was left alone . but how was it possible for a man of my undecided turn of mind to argue successfully with so irascible a person as the professor ? with this persuasion i was hurrying away to my own little retreat upstairs , when the street door creaked upon its hinges ; heavy feet made the whole flight of stairs to shake ; and the master of the house , passing rapidly through the dining - room , threw himself in haste into his own sanctum . but on his rapid way he had found time to fling his hazel stick into a corner , his rough broadbrim upon the table , and these few emphatic words at his nephew :",105

"the front door was open , so we rushed in and hurried from room to room to the amazement of a doddering old manservant , who met us in the passage . there was no light save in the dining - room , but holmes caught up the lamp and left no corner of the house unexplored . no sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing . on the upper floor , however , one of the bedroom doors was locked .",52

""" yes , professor , the sea supplies all my needs . sometimes i cast my nets in our wake , and i pull them up ready to burst . sometimes i go hunting right in the midst of this element that has long seemed so far out of man 's reach , and i corner the game that dwells in my underwater forests . like the flocks of old proteus , king neptune 's shepherd , my herds graze without fear on the ocean 's immense prairies . there i own vast properties that i harvest myself , and which are forever sown by the hand of the creator of all things .

"some thirty pictures by the masters , uniformly framed and separated by gleaming panoplies of arms , adorned walls on which were stretched tapestries of austere design . there i saw canvases of the highest value , the likes of which i had marveled at in private european collections and art exhibitions . the various schools of the old masters were represented by a raphael madonna , a virgin by leonardo da vinci , a nymph by correggio , a woman by titian , an adoration of the magi by veronese , an assumption of the virgin by murillo , a holbein portrait , a monk by velazquez , a martyr by ribera , a village fair by rubens , two flemish landscapes by teniers , three little genre paintings by gerard dow , metsu , and paul potter , two canvases by gericault and prud'hon , plus seascapes by backhuysen and vernet . among the works of modern art were pictures signed by delacroix , ingres , decamps , troyon , meissonier , daubigny , etc . , and some wonderful miniature statues in marble or bronze , modeled after antiquity 's finest originals , stood on their pedestals in the corners of this magnificent museum . as the nautilus 's commander had predicted , my mind was already starting to fall into that promised state of stunned amazement .",202
"captain nemo fell silent and seemed lost in reverie . i regarded him with intense excitement , silently analyzing his strange facial expression . leaning his elbow on the corner of a valuable mosaic table , he no longer saw me , he had forgotten my very presence .",29
"in some places , the wind , eddying round the corners , formed the snow into tall whirling columns , resembling those waterspouts which turn round on their base , and which vessels attack with a shot from a gun .",10
"i followed captain nemo , who , via one of the doors cut into the lounge 's canted corners , led me back down the ship 's gangways . he took me to the bow , and there i found not just a cabin but an elegant stateroom with a bed , a washstand , and various other furnishings .",18
"i crept forward through the nautilus 's dark gangways , pausing after each step to curb the pounding of my heart . i arrived at the corner door of the lounge . i opened it gently . the lounge was plunged in profound darkness . chords from the organ were reverberating faintly . captain nemo was there . he did n't see me . even in broad daylight i doubt that he would have noticed me , so completely was he immersed in his trance .",26

"if they each lay hid in a corner , and each fired at one of us , they would soon be masters of the colony ! """,7
"but there were ample signs that i had not come upon a false scent . this was certainly where the man lived . some blankets rolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which neolithic man had once slumbered . the ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate . beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket half - full of water . a litter of empty tins showed that the place had been occupied for some time , and i saw , as my eyes became accustomed to the checkered light , a pannikin and a half - full bottle of spirits standing in the corner . in the middle of the hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table , and upon this stood a small cloth bundle -- the same , no doubt , which i had seen through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy . it contained a loaf of bread , a tinned tongue , and two tins of preserved peaches . as i set it down again , after having examined it , my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it . i raised it , and this was what i read , roughly scrawled in pencil:--",113

"alice was not a bit hurt , and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment : she looked up , but it was all dark overhead ; before her was another long passage , and the white rabbit was still in sight , hurrying down it . there was not a moment to be lost : away went alice like the wind , and was just in time to hear it say , as it turned a corner , ' oh my ears and whiskers , how late it 's getting !

"after we had dined , or rather supped , i ordered friday to take one of the canoes , and go and fetch our muskets and other firearms , which , for want of time , we had left upon the place of battle ; and the next day i ordered him to go and bury the dead bodies of the savages , which lay open to the sun , and would presently be offensive . i also ordered him to bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast , which i could not think of doing myself ; nay , i could not bear to see them if i went that way ; all which he punctually performed , and effaced the very appearance of the savages being there ; so that when i went again , i could scarce know where it was , otherwise than by the corner of the wood pointing to the place .",150

"while dâ€™artagnan was examining mme . bonacieux , and was , as we have said , close to her , he saw on the ground a fine cambric handkerchief , which he picked up , as was his habit , and at the corner of which he recognized the same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had nearly caused him and aramis to cut each other â€™s throat .",43
"at the sixth cabaret , then , as we said , dâ€™artagnan stopped , asked for a bottle of wine of the best quality , and placing himself in the darkest corner of the room , determined thus to wait till daylight ; but this time again his hopes were disappointed , and although he listened with all his ears , he heard nothing , amid the oaths , coarse jokes , and abuse which passed between the laborers , servants , and carters who comprised the honorable society of which he formed a part , which could put him upon the least track of her who had been stolen from him .",31
