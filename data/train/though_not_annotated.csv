"we had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the thursday ; but when the thursday came there was no occasion for our testimony . a higher judge had taken the matter in hand , and jefferson hope had been summoned before a tribunal where strict justice would be meted out to him . on the very night after his capture the aneurism burst , and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of the cell , with a placid smile upon his face , as though he had been able in his dying moments to look back upon a useful life , and on work well done .",91

"i had often heard the song before , and always with lively delight ; for bessie had a sweet voice,--at least , i thought so . but now , though her voice was still sweet , i found in its melody an indescribable sadness .",29
"i speak particularly of the young ladies . st . john 's eyes , though clear enough in a literal sense , in a figurative one were difficult to fathom . he seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people 's thoughts , than as agents to reveal his own : the which combination of keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than to encourage .",14

"during the first days of the journey aouda became better acquainted with her protector , and constantly gave evidence of her deep gratitude for what he had done . the phlegmatic gentleman listened to her , apparently at least , with coldness , neither his voice nor his manner betraying the slightest emotion ; but he seemed to be always on the watch that nothing should be wanting to aouda 's comfort . he visited her regularly each day at certain hours , not so much to talk himself , as to sit and hear her talk . he treated her with the strictest politeness , but with the precision of an automaton , the movements of which had been arranged for this purpose . aouda did not quite know what to make of him , though passepartout had given her some hints of his master 's eccentricity , and made her smile by telling her of the wager which was sending him round the world . after all , she owed phileas fogg her life , and she always regarded him through the exalting medium of her gratitude .",136

"i confess that i was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the practical nature of my companion 's theories . my respect for his powers of analysis increased wondrously . there still remained some lurking suspicion in my mind , however , that the whole thing was a pre - arranged episode , intended to dazzle me , though what earthly object he could have in taking me in was past my comprehension . when i looked at him he had finished reading the note , and his eyes had assumed the vacant , lack - lustre expression which showed mental abstraction .",59
