""" well , "" said she , "" are you still so violently fond of miss cunegund of thunder - ten - tronckh ? """,1
""" well , merit this pretended happiness , then ! """,1

""" well , i will avenge you of this wretch , "" replied d’artagnan , giving himself the airs of don japhet of armenia .",1
"the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it , and then said , ' it was a treacle - well . '",23
"all is well , all is very well , all is well as possible . """,11
"' but they were in the well , ' alice said to the dormouse , not choosing to notice this last remark .",6
"just as she said this , she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it . ' that 's very curious ! ' she thought . ' but everything 's curious today . i think i may as well go in at once . ' and in she went .",43
"seven flung down his brush , and had just begun ' well , of all the unjust things-- ' when his eye chanced to fall upon alice , as she stood watching them , and he checked himself suddenly : the others looked round also , and all of them bowed low .",11
""" well , mademoiselle , what are you thinking about , standing there like a statue ?",1
""" father , "" said candide to the friar , "" you seem to me to enjoy a state of happiness that even kings might envy ; joy and health are painted in your countenance . you have a pretty wench to divert you ; and you seem to be perfectly well contented with your condition as a theatin . """,51
"martin , turning towards candide , with his usual indifference , said , "" well , what think you now ? have i won the wager entirely ? """,14
""" well ! "" said the reporter , pressing the sailor 's hand .",1
"as soon as they were seated , two very pretty girls , neatly dressed , brought in chocolate , which was extremely well prepared .",22
"' well , it must be removed , ' said the king very decidedly , and he called the queen , who was passing at the moment , ' my dear ! i wish you would have this cat removed ! '",1
"alice did not much like keeping so close to her : first , because the duchess was very ugly ; and secondly , because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon alice 's shoulder , and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin . however , she did not like to be rude , so she bore it as well as she could .",62
"' ah , well ! it means much the same thing , ' said the duchess , digging her sharp little chin into alice 's shoulder as she added , ' and the moral of that is--""take care of the sense , and the sounds will take care of themselves . "" '",3
"as soon as our two travelers had taken leave of his excellency , candide said to martin , "" well , i hope you will own that this man is the happiest of all mortals , for he is above everything he possesses . """,19
""" well , i feel as if transformed -- a confession weighs on my mind . """,1
""" well , "" said he , "" what news of miss cunegund ? does she still continue the paragon of beauty ? does she love me still ? how does she do ? you have , doubtless , purchased a superb palace for her at constantinople . """,1

""" well , well ! "" and d’artagnan rushed into athos ’s chamber .",3
"it is impossible for anyone to have been more lamely hanged than i had been . the executioner was a subdeacon , and knew how to burn people very well , but as for hanging , he was a novice at it , being quite out of practice ; the cord being wet , and not slipping properly , the noose did not join . in short , i still continued to breathe ; the crucial incision made me scream to such a degree , that my surgeon fell flat upon his back ; and imagining it was the devil he was dissecting , ran away , and in his fright tumbled down stairs .",29
""" well , but put on this dressing gown first , "" said the musketeer to his friend .",1
""" well ? "" said athos .",1
""" well , "" replied d’artagnan , bending his mouth to athos ’s ear , and lowering his voice , "" milady is marked with a fleur - de - lis upon her shoulder ! """,1
""" well , my dear pangloss , "" said candide to him , "" when you were hanged , dissected , whipped , and tugging at the oar , did you continue to think that everything in this world happens for the best ? """,1
""" i have always abided by my first opinion , "" answered pangloss ; "" for , after all , i am a philosopher , and it would not become me to retract my sentiments ; especially as leibnitz could not be in the wrong : and that preestablished harmony is the finest thing in the world , as well as a plenum and the materia subtilis .

""" i foresaw very well , "" said martin to candide "" that your presents would soon be squandered , and only make them more miserable . you and cacambo have spent millions of piastres , and yet you are not more happy than brother giroflee and pacquette . """,4
"the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived , with a great crowd assembled about them -- all sorts of little birds and beasts , as well as the whole pack of cards : the knave was standing before them , in chains , with a soldier on each side to guard him ; and near the king was the white rabbit , with a trumpet in one hand , and a scroll of parchment in the other . in the very middle of the court was a table , with a large dish of tarts upon it : they looked so good , that it made alice quite hungry to look at them--'i wish they 'd get the trial done , ' she thought , ' and hand round the refreshments ! ' but there seemed to be no chance of this , so she began looking at everything about her , to pass away the time .",32
""" well ! "" said the sailor , "" there is plenty of food at the chimneys , for you must know , captain , that down there , in the south , we have a house , with rooms , beds , and fireplace , and in the pantry , several dozen of birds , which our herbert calls couroucous .",1
"he recounted all the events with which cyrus was unacquainted , the last fall of the balloon , the landing on this unknown land , which appeared a desert ( whatever it was , whether island or continent ) , the discovery of the chimneys , the search for him , not forgetting of course neb 's devotion , the intelligence exhibited by the faithful top , as well as many other matters .",68
"well , let us pledge the ring , but upon one condition . """,0
"' well , at any rate , the dormouse said-- ' the hatter went on , looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too : but the dormouse denied nothing , being fast asleep .",1

""" too much of yourself in it ! upon my word , basil , i did n't know you were so vain ; and i really ca n't see any resemblance between you , with your rugged strong face and your coal - black hair , and this young adonis , who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose - leaves . why , my dear basil , he is a narcissus , and you-- well , of course you have an intellectual expression and all that . but beauty , real beauty , ends where an intellectual expression begins . intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration , and destroys the harmony of any face . the moment one sits down to think , one becomes all nose , or all forehead , or something horrid . look at the successful men in any of the learned professions . how perfectly hideous they are ! except , of course , in the church . but then in the church they do n't think . a bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen , and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful .",79
""" you do n't understand me , harry , "" answered the artist . "" of course i am not like him . i know that perfectly well . indeed , i should be sorry to look like him . you shrug your shoulders ? i am telling you the truth . there is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction , the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings . it is better not to be different from one 's fellows . the ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world . they can sit at their ease and gape at the play . if they know nothing of victory , they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat . they live as we all should live -- undisturbed , indifferent , and without disquiet . they neither bring ruin upon others , nor ever receive it from alien hands . your rank and wealth , harry ; my brains , such as they are -- my art , whatever it may be worth ; dorian gray 's good looks -- we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us , suffer terribly .
