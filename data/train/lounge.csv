"i had n't seen captain nemo for over a week , when , on the morning of the 27th , he entered the main lounge , as usual acting as if he 'd been gone for just five minutes . i was busy tracing the nautilus 's course on the world map . the captain approached , placed a finger over a position on the chart , and pronounced just one word :",24,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"on january 28 , in latitude 9 degrees 4 ' north , when the nautilus returned at noon to the surface of the sea , it lay in sight of land some eight miles to the west . right off , i observed a cluster of mountains about 2,000 feet high , whose shapes were very whimsically sculpted . after our position fix , i reentered the lounge , and when our bearings were reported on the chart , i saw that we were off the island of ceylon , that pearl dangling from the lower lobe of the indian peninsula .",67,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"i went looking in the library for a book about this island , one of the most fertile in the world . sure enough , i found a volume entitled ceylon and the singhalese by h. c. sirr , esq . reentering the lounge , i first noted the bearings of ceylon , on which antiquity lavished so many different names . it was located between latitude 5 degrees 55 ' and 9 degrees 49 ' north , and between longitude 79 degrees 42 ' and 82 degrees 4 ' east of the meridian of greenwich ; its length is 275 miles ; its maximum width , 150 miles ; its circumference , 900 miles ; its surface area , 24,448 square miles , in other words , a little smaller than that of ireland .",43,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"this said in a carefree tone , captain nemo left the lounge .",11,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"at 4:17 in the afternoon , during a high tea for passengers gathered in the main lounge , a collision occurred , scarcely noticeable on the whole , affecting the scotia 's hull in that quarter a little astern of its port paddle wheel .",16,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"crossing through the lounge , i arrived at the door , contrived in one of the canted corners , that opened into the captain 's stateroom . much to my astonishment , this door was ajar . i instinctively recoiled . if captain nemo was in his stateroom , he might see me . but , not hearing any sounds , i approached . the stateroom was deserted . i pushed the door open . i took a few steps inside . still the same austere , monastic appearance .",3,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"captain nemo did n't reply but signaled me to follow him to the main lounge . the nautilus sank a few meters beneath the waves , and the panels opened .",14,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"a few minutes before nine o'clock , i glued my ear to the captain 's door . not a sound . i left my stateroom and returned to the lounge , which was deserted and plunged in near darkness .",29,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"just then the door to the main lounge opened and captain nemo appeared . he saw me , and without further preamble :",7,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"leaning against the walls , i dragged myself down the gangways to the lounge , whose ceiling lights were on . the furniture had been knocked over . fortunately the glass cases were solidly secured at the base and had stood fast . since we were no longer vertical , the starboard pictures were glued to the tapestries , while those to port had their lower edges hanging a foot away from the wall . so the nautilus was lying on its starboard side , completely stationary to boot .",13,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"in its interior i heard the sound of footsteps and muffled voices . but captain nemo did n't appear . just as i was about to leave the lounge , ned land and conseil entered .",28,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"i returned to the lounge . the nautilus still emerged above the surface . a few morning gleams infiltrated the liquid strata . beneath the undulations of the billows , the windows were enlivened by the blushing of the rising sun . that dreadful day of june 2 had dawned .",4,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"i could n't hold still . frantic , going insane , i leaped out of my stateroom and rushed into the lounge .",21,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
we left the lounge . nobody in the library . nobody by the central companionway or the crew 's quarters . i assumed that captain nemo was stationed in the pilothouse . best to wait . the three of us returned to the lounge .,3,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0

"the captain stood up and invited me to follow him . i 'd had time to collect myself . i did so . the lounge was dark , but the sea 's waves sparkled through the transparent windows . i stared .",24,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"the panels closed over this frightful view , but the lights did n't go on in the lounge . inside the nautilus all was gloom and silence . it left this place of devastation with prodigious speed , 100 feet beneath the waters . where was it going ? north or south ? where would the man flee after this horrible act of revenge ?",17,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"at eleven o'clock the electric lights came back on . i went into the lounge . it was deserted . i consulted the various instruments . the nautilus was fleeing northward at a speed of twenty - five miles per hour , sometimes on the surface of the sea , sometimes thirty feet beneath it .",14,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"suddenly a slight movement could be felt over the hull . obviously the nautilus was straightening a bit . objects hanging in the lounge were visibly returning to their normal positions . the walls were approaching the vertical . nobody said a word . hearts pounding , we could see and feel the ship righting itself . the floor was becoming horizontal beneath our feet . ten minutes went by .",23,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
""" yes , "" captain nemo said , heading to the lounge door .",11,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"just then captain nemo opened a door facing the one by which i had entered the library , and i passed into an immense , splendidly lit lounge .",27,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
""" professor , "" this strange man then said , "" you must excuse the informality with which i receive you , and the disorder reigning in this lounge . """,28,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
""" what about these composers ? "" i said , pointing to sheet music by weber , rossini , mozart , beethoven , haydn , meyerbeer , hérold , wagner , auber , gounod , victor massé , and a number of others scattered over a full size piano - organ , which occupied one of the wall panels in this lounge .",61,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"the ceiling lights were off , yet the lounge was still brightly lit . this was due to the reflecting power of the walls of ice , which threw the beams of our beacon right back at us . words can not describe the effects produced by our galvanic rays on these huge , whimsically sculpted blocks , whose every angle , ridge , and facet gave off a different glow depending on the nature of the veins running inside the ice . it was a dazzling mine of gems , in particular sapphires and emeralds , whose jets of blue and green crisscrossed . here and there , opaline hues of infinite subtlety raced among sparks of light that were like so many fiery diamonds , their brilliance more than any eye could stand . the power of our beacon was increased a hundredfold , like a lamp shining through the biconvex lenses of a world - class lighthouse .",8,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
i did n't disturb his meditations but continued to pass in review the curiosities that enriched this lounge .,17,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"after the works of art , natural rarities predominated . they consisted chiefly of plants , shells , and other exhibits from the ocean that must have been captain nemo 's own personal finds . in the middle of the lounge , a jet of water , electrically lit , fell back into a basin made from a single giant clam . the delicately festooned rim of this shell , supplied by the biggest mollusk in the class acephala , measured about six meters in circumference ; so it was even bigger than those fine giant clams given to king françois i by the republic of venice , and which the church of saint - sulpice in paris has made into two gigantic holy - water fonts .",40,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"the canadian returned to conseil 's side . as soon as i was dressed , i went into the lounge . the compass was n't encouraging . the nautilus 's course was south - southwest . we were turning our backs on europe .",19,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"i wanted to verify the nautilus 's heading . i made my way to the lounge . we were racing north - northeast with frightful speed , fifty meters down .",15,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"i followed captain nemo , who , via one of the doors cut into the lounge 's canted corners , led me back down the ship 's gangways . he took me to the bow , and there i found not just a cabin but an elegant stateroom with a bed , a washstand , and various other furnishings .",15,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
""" your stateroom adjoins mine , "" he told me , opening a door , "" and mine leads into that lounge we 've just left . """,21,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"then a sudden thought terrified me . captain nemo had left his stateroom . he was in the same lounge i had to cross in order to escape . there i would encounter him one last time . he would see me , perhaps speak to me ! one gesture from him could obliterate me , a single word shackle me to his vessel !",19,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"i crept forward through the nautilus 's dark gangways , pausing after each step to curb the pounding of my heart . i arrived at the corner door of the lounge . i opened it gently . the lounge was plunged in profound darkness . chords from the organ were reverberating faintly . captain nemo was there . he did n't see me . even in broad daylight i doubt that he would have noticed me , so completely was he immersed in his trance .",30,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0

""" sir , "" captain nemo said , showing me the instruments hanging on the walls of his stateroom , "" these are the devices needed to navigate the nautilus . here , as in the lounge , i always have them before my eyes , and they indicate my position and exact heading in the midst of the ocean . you 're familiar with some of them , such as the thermometer , which gives the temperature inside the nautilus ; the barometer , which measures the heaviness of the outside air and forecasts changes in the weather ; the humidistat , which indicates the degree of dryness in the atmosphere ; the storm glass , whose mixture decomposes to foretell the arrival of tempests ; the compass , which steers my course ; the sextant , which takes the sun 's altitude and tells me my latitude ; chronometers , which allow me to calculate my longitude ; and finally , spyglasses for both day and night , enabling me to scrutinize every point of the horizon once the nautilus has risen to the surface of the waves . """,36,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"the next day at four o'clock in the morning , i was awakened by the steward whom captain nemo had placed expressly at my service . i got up quickly , dressed , and went into the lounge . captain nemo was waiting for me .",37,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"i strolled for a little while from the lounge into the library . my companions kept their seats and did n't move . soon i threw myself down on a couch and picked up a book , which my eyes skimmed mechanically .",8,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"the hours passed . i often studied the instruments hanging on the lounge wall . the pressure gauge indicated that the nautilus stayed at a constant depth of 300 meters , the compass that it kept heading south , the log that it was traveling at a speed of twenty miles per hour , an excessive speed in such a cramped area . but captain nemo knew that by this point there was no such thing as too fast , since minutes were now worth centuries .",12,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
just then the captain entered the lounge . i went to him .,6,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"in essence , i was already familiar with the whole forward part of this underwater boat , and here are its exact subdivisions going from amidships to its spur : the dining room , 5 meters long and separated from the library by a watertight bulkhead , in other words , it could n't be penetrated by the sea ; the library , 5 meters long ; the main lounge , 10 meters long , separated from the captain 's stateroom by a second watertight bulkhead ; the aforesaid stateroom , 5 meters long ; mine , 2.5 meters long ; and finally , air tanks 7.5 meters long and extending to the stempost . total : a length of 35 meters . doors were cut into the watertight bulkheads and were shut hermetically by means of india - rubber seals , which insured complete safety aboard the nautilus in the event of a leak in any one section .",69,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
""" can the panels in the lounge be left open ? """,6,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"after going down a fairly steep slope , our feet trod the floor of a sort of circular pit . there captain nemo stopped , and his hand indicated an object that i had n't yet noticed . it was an oyster of extraordinary dimensions , a titanic giant clam , a holy - water font that could have held a whole lake , a basin more than two meters wide , hence even bigger than the one adorning the nautilus 's lounge .",82,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"after ned was dressed , i reentered the lounge , whose windows had been uncovered ; stationed next to conseil , i examined the strata surrounding and supporting the nautilus .",8,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
""" not at all , professor , "" the captain answered me after a slight hesitation , "" since you 'll never leave this underwater boat . come into the lounge . it 's actually our work room , and there you 'll learn the full story about the nautilus ! """,30,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"a moment later we were seated on a couch in the lounge , cigars between our lips . the captain placed before my eyes a working drawing that gave the ground plan , cross section , and side view of the nautilus . then he began his description as follows :",11,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"the captain understood and gave me a signal to follow him . we returned on board . my diving suit removed , i went with him to the lounge .",28,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"i took one last look at the sea , a little yellowish near the landing places of japan , and i went below again to the main lounge .",27,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"captain nemo decided to take his nautilus down to the lowest depths in order to double - check these different soundings . i got ready to record the results of this experiment . the panels in the lounge opened , and maneuvers began for reaching those strata so prodigiously far removed .",37,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"under this powerful thrust the nautilus 's hull quivered like a resonating chord , and the ship sank steadily under the waters . stationed in the lounge , the captain and i watched the needle swerving swiftly over the pressure gauge . soon we had gone below the livable zone where most fish reside . some of these animals can thrive only at the surface of seas or rivers , but a minority can dwell at fairly great depths . among the latter i observed a species of dogfish called the cow shark that 's equipped with six respiratory slits , the telescope fish with its enormous eyes , the armored gurnard with gray thoracic fins plus black pectoral fins and a breastplate protected by pale red slabs of bone , then finally the grenadier , living at a depth of 1,200 meters , by that point tolerating a pressure of 120 atmospheres .",26,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
""" and now , professor , "" the captain added , "" i 'll leave you to your intellectual pursuits . i 've set our course east - northeast at a depth of fifty meters . here are some large - scale charts on which you 'll be able to follow that course . the lounge is at your disposal , and with your permission , i 'll take my leave . """,55,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"i went below to the lounge , from which some chords were wafting . captain nemo was there , leaning over the organ , deep in a musical trance .",5,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"by then all our past sufferings were forgotten . the memory of that imprisonment under the ice faded from our minds . we had thoughts only of the future . captain nemo no longer appeared , neither in the lounge nor on the platform . the positions reported each day on the world map were put there by the chief officer , and they enabled me to determine the nautilus 's exact heading . now then , that evening it became obvious , much to my satisfaction , that we were returning north by the atlantic route .",39,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
""" if master says so , then so be it , "" conseil answered . "" but in all honesty , this lounge is enough to astonish even someone flemish like myself . """,22,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"despite the powerful pressures it was undergoing , the nautilus sank still deeper . i could feel its sheet - iron plates trembling down to their riveted joins ; metal bars arched ; bulkheads groaned ; the lounge windows seemed to be warping inward under the water 's pressure . and this whole sturdy mechanism would surely have given way , if , as its captain had said , it were n't capable of resisting like a solid block .",37,"('lounge', 'salon', 'cristal')",1
"going back under the waters , the nautilus drew near the coast , cruising along it for only a few miles . through the lounge windows i could see long creepers and gigantic fucus plants , bulb - bearing seaweed of which the open sea at the pole had revealed a few specimens ; with their smooth , viscous filaments , they measured as much as 300 meters long ; genuine cables more than an inch thick and very tough , they 're often used as mooring lines for ships . another weed , known by the name velp and boasting four - foot leaves , was crammed into the coral concretions and carpeted the ocean floor . it served as both nest and nourishment for myriads of crustaceans and mollusks , for crabs and cuttlefish . here seals and otters could indulge in a sumptuous meal , mixing meat from fish with vegetables from the sea , like the english with their irish stews .",24,"('lounge', 'salon', 'cristal')",1
"suddenly , through two oblong openings , daylight appeared on both sides of the lounge . the liquid masses came into view , brightly lit by the ship 's electric outpourings . we were separated from the sea by two panes of glass . initially i shuddered at the thought that these fragile partitions could break ; but strong copper bands secured them , giving them nearly infinite resistance .",14,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"if we accept the hypotheses of the microbiologist ehrenberg-- who believes that these underwater depths are lit up by phosphorescent organisms -- nature has certainly saved one of her most prodigious sights for residents of the sea , and i could judge for myself from the thousandfold play of the light . on both sides i had windows opening over these unexplored depths . the darkness in the lounge enhanced the brightness outside , and we stared as if this clear glass were the window of an immense aquarium .",68,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"this measure was distasteful to me . to my mind it would lead nowhere . we could hope for nothing from the nautilus 's commander but could depend only on ourselves . besides , for some time now the man had been gloomier , more withdrawn , less sociable . he seemed to be avoiding me . i encountered him only at rare intervals . he used to take pleasure in explaining the underwater wonders to me ; now he left me to my research and no longer entered the lounge .",90,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
i went below to the lounge . i found no one there . i ventured a knock at the door opening into the captain 's stateroom .,5,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"suddenly daylight appeared in the lounge . the sheet - iron panels slid shut . the magical vision disappeared . but for a good while i kept dreaming away , until the moment my eyes focused on the instruments hanging on the wall . the compass still showed our heading as east - northeast , the pressure gauge indicated a pressure of five atmospheres ( corresponding to a depth of fifty meters ) , and the electric log gave our speed as fifteen miles per hour .",5,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"as soon as i was dressed , i made my way to the main lounge . it was deserted . i dove into studying the conchological treasures amassed inside the glass cases . i also investigated the huge plant albums that were filled with the rarest marine herbs , which , although they were pressed and dried , still kept their wonderful colors . among these valuable water plants , i noted various seaweed : some cladostephus verticillatus , peacock 's tails , fig - leafed caulerpa , grain - bearing beauty bushes , delicate rosetangle tinted scarlet , sea colander arranged into fan shapes , mermaid 's cups that looked like the caps of squat mushrooms and for years had been classified among the zoophytes ; in short , a complete series of algae .",14,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"i still waited for a while , then i made my way to the main lounge . its timepiece marked 2:30 . in ten minutes the tide would reach its maximum elevation , and if captain nemo had n't made a rash promise , the nautilus would immediately break free . if not , many months might pass before it could leave its coral bed .",15,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
at 2:35 captain nemo appeared in the lounge .,7,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"when i woke up the next day , november 17 , i sensed that the nautilus was completely motionless . i dressed hurriedly and entered the main lounge .",27,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"from eight to nine o'clock , the nautilus stayed a few meters beneath the waters . according to my calculations , we had to be quite close to suez . through the panels in the lounge , i spotted rocky bottoms brightly lit by our electric rays . it seemed to me that the strait was getting narrower and narrower .",35,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"the nautilus was certainly afloat , but it was no longer in motion . the blades of its propeller were n't churning the waves . a minute passed . followed by his chief officer , captain nemo entered the lounge .",39,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"there was just time to run to the rescue of the baleen whales . the nautilus proceeded to midwater . conseil , ned , and i sat in front of the lounge windows . captain nemo made his way to the helmsman 's side to operate his submersible as an engine of destruction . soon i felt the beats of our propeller getting faster , and we picked up speed .",31,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"my companions and i then witnessed an unusual sight . the panels in the lounge were open , and since the nautilus 's beacon was off , a hazy darkness reigned in the midst of the waters . covered with heavy clouds , the stormy sky gave only the faintest light to the ocean 's upper strata .",14,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"just then the chief officer drew the captain 's attention anew . the latter interrupted his strolling and aimed his spyglass at the point indicated . he observed it a good while . as for me , deeply puzzled , i went below to the lounge and brought back an excellent long - range telescope i habitually used . leaning my elbows on the beacon housing , which jutted from the stern of the platform , i got set to scour that whole stretch of sky and sea . but no sooner had i peered into the eyepiece than the instrument was snatched from my hands .",45,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"near two o'clock i was busy organizing my notes in the lounge , when the captain opened the door and appeared . i bowed to him . he gave me an almost imperceptible bow in return , without saying a word to me . i resumed my work , hoping he might give me some explanation of the previous afternoon 's events . he did nothing of the sort . i stared at him . his face looked exhausted ; his reddened eyes had n't been refreshed by sleep ; his facial features expressed profound sadness , real chagrin . he walked up and down , sat and stood , picked up a book at random , discarded it immediately , consulted his instruments without taking his customary notes , and seemed unable to rest easy for an instant .",11,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"est in carpathio neptuni gurgite vates caeruleus proteus . . . * it was indeed that bygone abode of proteus , the old shepherd of king neptune 's flocks : an island located between rhodes and crete , which greeks now call karpathos , italians scarpanto . through the lounge window i could see only its granite bedrock .",49,"('lounge', 'salon', 'cristal')",1
"so i did n't allude to this event when , that evening , i chanced to be alone with the captain in the lounge . besides , he seemed silent and preoccupied . then , contrary to custom , he ordered that both panels in the lounge be opened , and going from the one to the other , he carefully observed the watery mass . for what purpose ? i had n't a guess , and for my part , i spent my time studying the fish that passed before my eyes .",23,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0

"this said , captain nemo went to a cabinet standing near the lounge 's left panel . next to this cabinet i saw a chest bound with hoops of iron , its lid bearing a copper plaque that displayed the nautilus 's monogram with its motto mobilis in mobili .",12,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"through the lounge 's open windows , i saw large , frightened fish passing like phantoms in the fiery waters . some were struck by lightning right before my eyes !",2,"('lounge', 'salon', 'cristal')",1
"this done , the captain pressed a button whose wiring was in communication with the crew 's quarters . four men appeared and , not without difficulty , pushed the chest out of the lounge . then i heard them hoist it up the iron companionway by means of pulleys .",34,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
i took a seat in the lounge with conseil . through the open window we stared at the lower strata of this southernmost ocean . the thermometer rose again . the needle on the pressure gauge swerved over its dial .,6,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"the next day , march 19 , at five o'clock in the morning , i was back at my post in the lounge . the electric log indicated that the nautilus had reduced speed . by then it was rising to the surface , but cautiously , while slowly emptying its ballast tanks .",22,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"i was about to leave the lounge when captain nemo entered . he approached the thermometer , consulted it , and turned to me :",6,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"finally , at six o'clock in the morning on that memorable day of march 19 , the lounge door opened . captain nemo appeared .",17,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"this said , captain nemo headed to the hatch and disappeared down the ladder . i followed him and went back to the main lounge . the propeller was instantly set in motion , and the log gave our speed as twenty miles per hour .",24,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"almost every day the panels in the lounge were open for some hours , and our eyes never tired of probing the mysteries of the underwater world .",7,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"during the day of december 11 , i was busy reading in the main lounge . ned land and conseil were observing the luminous waters through the gaping panels . the nautilus was motionless . its ballast tanks full , it was sitting at a depth of 1,000 meters in a comparatively unpopulated region of the ocean where only larger fish put in occasional appearances .",14,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"i returned to the lounge . the hatch closed , and i heard water hissing in the ballast tanks . the nautilus began to sink on a vertical line , because its propeller was in check and no longer furnished any forward motion .",4,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"the ceiling lights in the lounge then went out , the panels opened , and through the windows i saw , for a half - mile radius , the sea brightly lit by the beacon 's rays .",5,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
"inside the mediterranean , then , i could catch no more of its fast - passing scenery than a traveler might see from an express train ; in other words , i could view only the distant horizons because the foregrounds flashed by like lightning . but conseil and i were able to observe those mediterranean fish whose powerful fins kept pace for a while in the nautilus 's waters . we stayed on watch before the lounge windows , and our notes enable me to reconstruct , in a few words , the ichthyology of this sea .",77,"('lounge', 'salon', 'cristal')",1
"the blizzard lasted until the next day . it was impossible to stay on the platform . from the lounge , where i was writing up the incidents of this excursion to the polar continent , i could hear the calls of petrel and albatross cavorting in the midst of the turmoil . the nautilus did n't stay idle , and cruising along the coast , it advanced some ten miles farther south amid the half light left by the sun as it skimmed the edge of the horizon .",19,"('lounge', 'salon', 'salón')",0
