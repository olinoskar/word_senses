"there are two currents here : an upper current , long known to exist , that carries the ocean 's waters into the mediterranean basin ; then a lower countercurrent , the only present - day proof of its existence being logic . in essence , the mediterranean receives a continual influx of water not only from the atlantic but from rivers emptying into it ; since local evaporation is n't enough to restore the balance , the total amount of added water should make this sea 's level higher every year . yet this is n't the case , and we 're naturally forced to believe in the existence of some lower current that carries the mediterranean 's surplus through the strait of gibraltar and into the atlantic basin .",8

at times it almost seemed as if an under - current raised these monstrous billows which thundered against the wall of granite house .,10
"it was sufficient to place a plate of soft iron before the magnet , which , attracted during the passage of the current , would fall back when the current was interrupted .",29
""" yes , francs ! 3,000,000 francs ! "" i went on . "" but i do n't think these fisheries bring in the returns they once did . similarly , the central american fisheries used to make an annual profit of 4,000,000 francs during the reign of king charles v , but now they bring in only two - thirds of that amount . all in all , it 's estimated that 9,000,000 francs is the current yearly return for the whole pearl - harvesting industry .

"by then it was three o'clock in the afternoon . the current was slacking off , it was almost full tide . the nautilus drew near this island , which i can see to this day with its remarkable fringe of screw pines . we hugged it from less than two miles out . a sudden jolt threw me down . the nautilus had just struck a reef , and it remained motionless , listing slightly to port .",11
the current bore him along and he rapidly receded from the shore .,1
"captain nemo was obviously familiar with this bivalve 's existence . this was n't the first time he 'd paid it a visit , and i thought his sole reason for leading us to this locality was to show us a natural curiosity . i was mistaken . captain nemo had an explicit personal interest in checking on the current condition of this giant clam .",59
"in the meanwhile , considering the rapid current , harding was led to suppose that he and his companions were much farther from the western coast than they had at first supposed .",7
"in fact , at this hour , the rising tide would have turned back the current of the creek , if its mouth had only been a few miles distant .",15
"by sunrise we were off . carried by an inbound current , the longboat reached the island in a matter of moments .",10
"but i tell you -- and you may mark my words -- you will come some day to a craggy pass in the channel , where the whole of life 's stream will be broken up into whirl and tumult , foam and noise : either you will be dashed to atoms on crag points , or lifted up and borne on by some master - wave into a calmer current -- as i am now .",70
"all on board feared that it could not be done , and every one -- phileas fogg , no doubt , excepted -- felt his heart beat with impatience . the boat must keep up an average of nine miles an hour , and the wind was becoming calmer every moment ! it was a capricious breeze , coming from the coast , and after it passed the sea became smooth . still , the tankadere was so light , and her fine sails caught the fickle zephyrs so well , that , with the aid of the currents john bunsby found himself at six o'clock not more than ten miles from the mouth of shanghai river . shanghai itself is situated at least twelve miles up the stream . at seven they were still three miles from shanghai . the pilot swore an angry oath ; the reward of two hundred pounds was evidently on the point of escaping him . he looked at mr . fogg . mr . fogg was perfectly tranquil ; and yet his whole fortune was at this moment at stake .",98

""" fish ? rarely ! "" he answered me . "" but given the current state of marine science , who are we to presume , what do we really know of these depths ? """,14
"i was , perhaps , the more forcibly impressed with it as he gave it , because , in the under or mystic current of its meaning , i fancied that i perceived , and for the first time , a full consciousness on the part of usher of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne .",23
"the islet and the coast were separated by a channel about half a mile in breadth , through which rushed an extremely rapid current .",23
"the tide would be rising for an hour and a half , and the ebb current being already weakened , it would be easy for the brig to advance .",15
"i spent the evening in reading , writing , and thinking . then drowsiness overtook me , i stretched out on my eelgrass mattress , and i fell into a deep slumber , while the nautilus glided through the swiftly flowing black current .",42
"pillars of smoke and flame escaped from the crater ; a hail of scoriae fell on the ground ; but no current of lava burst from the mouth of the volcano , which proved that the volcanic matter had not yet attained the level of the superior orifice of the central shaft .",21
"flattery was at that period very current , and m. de treville loved incense as well as a king , or even a cardinal .",6
"now the current , by carrying the bodies of these miserable men out to sea , would spare the colonists the sad task of burying them in some corner of their island .",2
"it is indeed a river that runs independently through the middle of the atlantic , its waters never mixing with the ocean 's waters . it 's a salty river , saltier than the sea surrounding it . its average depth is 3,000 feet , its average width sixty miles . in certain localities its current moves at a speed of four kilometers per hour . the unchanging volume of its waters is greater than that of all the world 's rivers combined .",55
"about four oâ€™clock in the evening , being then within a league of the island , i found the point of the rocks which occasioned this disaster stretching out , as is described before , to the southward , and casting off the current more southerly , had , of course , made another eddy to the north ; and this i found very strong , but not directly setting the way my course lay , which was due west , but almost full north . however , having a fresh gale , i stretched across this eddy , slanting north - west ; and in about an hour came within about a mile of the shore , where , it being smooth water , i soon got to land .",43
"but one distressing circumstance totally thwarted the canadian 's plans . the weather was thoroughly foul . we were approaching waterways where storms are commonplace , the very homeland of tornadoes and cyclones specifically engendered by the gulf stream 's current . to face a frequently raging sea in a frail skiff was a race to certain disaster . ned land conceded this himself . so he champed at the bit , in the grip of an intense homesickness that could be cured only by our escape .",40
"the weather was magnificent , the sea as calm as if its waters were contained within the narrow limits of a lake . thus the boat could proceed with as much security as if it was ascending the tranquil current of the mercy .",39
"this wire lay along the ground , and was surrounded with an isolating substance like a submarine cable , so as to assure the free transmission of the current .",28
"first , there was the account - current of the produce of my farm or plantation , from the year when their fathers had balanced with my old portugal captain , being for six years ; the balance appeared to be one thousand one hundred and seventy - four moidores in my favour .",7
"this incident did not interrupt our walk . for two hours we were sometimes led over plains of sand , sometimes over prairies of seaweed that were quite arduous to cross . in all honesty , i was dead tired by the time i spotted a hazy glow half a mile away , cutting through the darkness of the waters . it was the nautilus 's beacon . within twenty minutes we would be on board , and there i could breathe easy again -- because my tank 's current air supply seemed to be quite low in oxygen . but i was reckoning without an encounter that slightly delayed our arrival .",89
"oh , that gulf stream ! it truly lives up to its nickname , the lord of storms ! all by itself it creates these fearsome cyclones through the difference in temperature between its currents and the superimposed layers of air .",34
"when i had absorbed a chestful of this clean air , i looked for the conduit -- the "" air carrier , "" if you prefer -- that allowed this beneficial influx to reach us , and i soon found it . above the door opened an air vent that let in a fresh current of oxygen , renewing the thin air in our cell .",54
"in the midst of the watery mass , brightly lit by our electric beams , there snaked past those one - meter lampreys that are common to nearly every clime . a type of ray from the genus oxyrhynchus , five feet wide , had a white belly with a spotted , ash - gray back and was carried along by the currents like a huge , wide - open shawl . other rays passed by so quickly i could n't tell if they deserved that name "" eagle ray "" coined by the ancient greeks , or those designations of "" rat ray , "" "" bat ray , "" and "" toad ray "" that modern fishermen have inflicted on them . dogfish known as topes , twelve feet long and especially feared by divers , were racing with each other . looking like big bluish shadows , thresher sharks went by , eight feet long and gifted with an extremely acute sense of smell . dorados from the genus sparus , some measuring up to thirteen decimeters , appeared in silver and azure costumes encircled with ribbons , which contrasted with the dark color of their fins ; fish sacred to the goddess venus , their eyes set in brows of gold ; a valuable species that patronizes all waters fresh or salt , equally at home in rivers , lakes , and oceans , living in every clime , tolerating any temperature , their line dating back to prehistoric times on this earth yet preserving all its beauty from those far - off days . magnificent sturgeons , nine to ten meters long and extremely fast , banged their powerful tails against the glass of our panels , showing bluish backs with small brown spots ; they resemble sharks , without equaling their strength , and are encountered in every sea ; in the spring they delight in swimming up the great rivers , fighting the currents of the volga , danube , po , rhine , loire , and oder , while feeding on herring , mackerel , salmon , and codfish ; although they belong to the class of cartilaginous fish , they rate as a delicacy ; they 're eaten fresh , dried , marinated , or salt - preserved , and in olden times they were borne in triumph to the table of the roman epicure lucullus . but whenever the nautilus drew near the surface , those denizens of the mediterranean i could observe most productively belonged to the sixty - third genus of bony fish . these were tuna from the genus scomber , blue - black on top , silver on the belly armor , their dorsal stripes giving off a golden gleam . they are said to follow ships in search of refreshing shade from the hot tropical sun , and they did just that with the nautilus , as they had once done with the vessels of the count de la pÃ©rouse . for long hours they competed in speed with our submersible . i could n't stop marveling at these animals so perfectly cut out for racing , their heads small , their bodies sleek , spindle - shaped , and in some cases over three meters long , their pectoral fins gifted with remarkable strength , their caudal fins forked . like certain flocks of birds , whose speed they equal , these tuna swim in triangle formation , which prompted the ancients to say they 'd boned up on geometry and military strategy . and yet they ca n't escape the provenÃ§al fishermen , who prize them as highly as did the ancient inhabitants of turkey and italy ; and these valuable animals , as oblivious as if they were deaf and blind , leap right into the marseilles tuna nets and perish by the thousands .",62

"gideon spilett had already several times pondered whether to throw into the sea a letter enclosed in a bottle , which currents might perhaps carry to an inhabited coast , or to confide it to pigeons .",21
