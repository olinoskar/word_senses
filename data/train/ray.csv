"the star of day , pale but nevertheless still splendid , was setting in the horizon , glorifying at once the heavens and the sea with bands of fire , and casting upon the towers and the old houses of the city a last ray of gold which made the windows sparkle like the reflection of a conflagration .",44,"('ray', 'rayon', 'rayar')",1

"i then entered a dining room , decorated and furnished in austere good taste . inlaid with ebony trim , tall oaken sideboards stood at both ends of this room , and sparkling on their shelves were staggered rows of earthenware , porcelain , and glass of incalculable value . there silver - plated dinnerware gleamed under rays pouring from light fixtures in the ceiling , whose glare was softened and tempered by delicately painted designs .",57,"('ray', 'rayon', 'rayo')",0

"the ceiling lights were off , yet the lounge was still brightly lit . this was due to the reflecting power of the walls of ice , which threw the beams of our beacon right back at us . words can not describe the effects produced by our galvanic rays on these huge , whimsically sculpted blocks , whose every angle , ridge , and facet gave off a different glow depending on the nature of the veins running inside the ice . it was a dazzling mine of gems , in particular sapphires and emeralds , whose jets of blue and green crisscrossed . here and there , opaline hues of infinite subtlety raced among sparks of light that were like so many fiery diamonds , their brilliance more than any eye could stand . the power of our beacon was increased a hundredfold , like a lamp shining through the biconvex lenses of a world - class lighthouse .",49,"('ray', 'rayon', 'rayo')",0
"day had returned . no ray of light penetrated into the profundity of the cavern . it being high - water , the entrance was closed by the sea . but the artificial light , which escaped in long streams from the skylights of the "" nautilus "" was as vivid as before , and the sheet of water shone around the floating vessel .",5,"('ray', 'rayon', 'rayar')",1

"if my eyes were able to range afar over this great sea , it was because a peculiar light brought to view every detail of it . it was not the light of the sun , with his dazzling shafts of brightness and the splendour of his rays ; nor was it the pale and uncertain shimmer of the moonbeams , the dim reflection of a nobler body of light . no ; the illuminating power of this light , its trembling diffusiveness , its bright , clear whiteness , and its low temperature , showed that it must be of electric origin . it was like an aurora borealis , a continuous cosmical phenomenon , filling a cavern of sufficient extent to contain an ocean .",47,"('ray', 'rayon', 'rayo')",0

"i made no answer , but went and sat forward . the northern shore was already beginning to dip under the horizon . the eastern and western strands spread wide as if to bid us farewell . before our eyes lay far and wide a vast sea ; shadows of great clouds swept heavily over its silver - grey surface ; the glistening bluish rays of electric light , here and there reflected by the dancing drops of spray , shot out little sheaves of light from the track we left in our rear . soon we entirely lost sight of land ; no object was left for the eye to judge by , and but for the frothy track of the raft , i might have thought we were standing still .",64,"('ray', 'rayon', 'rayo')",0

"the fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface from our minds the grim and gray impression which had been left upon both of us by our first experience of baskerville hall . as sir henry and i sat at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through the high mullioned windows , throwing watery patches of colour from the coats of arms which covered them . the dark panelling glowed like bronze in the golden rays , and it was hard to realize that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such a gloom into our souls upon the evening before .",76,"('ray', 'rayon', 'rayo')",0
