"as may be seen , the sailor 's confidence in the tutelary deity of his island was absolute , and , certainly , the occult power , manifested until now in so many inexplicable ways , appeared to be unlimited ; but also it knew how to escape the colonists ' most minute researches , for , in spite of all their efforts , in spite of the more than zeal,--the obstinacy,--with which they carried on their exploration , the retreat of the mysterious being could not be discovered .",36
"this smile appeared to d’artagnan to be of bad augury . only , as our gascon was not easily intimidated -- or rather , thanks to a great pride natural to the men of his country , he did not allow one easily to see what was passing in his mind when that which was passing at all resembled fear -- he placed himself haughtily in front of messieurs the guards , and waited with his hand on his hip , in an attitude by no means deficient in majesty .",2

"this time felton , immovable as he was , or appeared to be , could not resist the secret influence which had already taken possession of him . to see this woman , so beautiful , fair as the brightest vision , to see her by turns overcome with grief and threatening ; to resist at once the ascendancy of grief and beauty -- it was too much for a visionary ; it was too much for a brain weakened by the ardent dreams of an ecstatic faith ; it was too much for a heart furrowed by the love of heaven that burns , by the hatred of men that devours . milady saw the trouble .",10
"i had no reply to this . obviously we were just groping blindly . but how else could we go about it ? all the same , our chances were automatically pretty limited . yet everyone still felt confident of success , and not a sailor on board would have bet against the narwhale appearing , and soon .",54
"so the reaction set in . at first , discouragement took hold of people 's minds , opening the door to disbelief . a new feeling appeared on board , made up of three - tenths shame and seven - tenths fury . the crew called themselves "" out - and - out fools "" for being hoodwinked by a fairy tale , then grew steadily more furious ! the mountains of arguments amassed over a year collapsed all at once , and each man now wanted only to catch up on his eating and sleeping , to make up for the time he had so stupidly sacrificed .",26
"this promise was given on november 2 . it had the immediate effect of reviving the crew 's failing spirits . the ocean was observed with renewed care . each man wanted one last look with which to sum up his experience . spyglasses functioned with feverish energy . a supreme challenge had been issued to the giant narwhale , and the latter had no acceptable excuse for ignoring this summons to appear !",72

"on leaving the forest , the mountain system of the country appeared before the explorers .",11
"the mountain was composed of two cones ; the first , truncated at a height of about two thousand five hundred feet , was sustained by buttresses , which appeared to branch out like the talons of an immense claw set on the ground .",29
"there appeared to be less vegetation on that side of the mountain which was exposed to the northeast , and deep fissures could be seen which , no doubt , were watercourses .",1
"it appeared formed of bare earth , here and there pierced by reddish rocks .",1
"at this moment the reporter appeared round a rock , and herbert , thinking that he had not seen the jaguar , was about to rush towards him , when gideon spilett signed to him to remain where he was .",5
"it had appeared necessary to enlarge their dimensions , for the feathered population had increased considerably .",2
"after leaving the region of bushes , the party , assisted by resting on each other 's shoulders , climbed for about a hundred feet up a steep acclivity and reached a level place , with very few trees , where the soil appeared volcanic .",43
"during the night , cyrus harding and gideon spilett had no opportunity for talking together , and yet the words pronounced in the reporter 's ear by the engineer were well worth being discussed , together with the mysterious influence which appeared to reign over lincoln island .",41
"it appeared prudent to him to heighten the palisade and to flank it with a sort of blockhouse , which , if necessary , the settlers could hold against the enemy .",1
"on her side mme . bonacieux had also reflected ; but , it must be admitted , upon something widely different from ambition . in spite of herself her thoughts constantly reverted to that handsome young man who was so brave and appeared to be so much in love . married at eighteen to m. bonacieux , having always lived among her husband ’s friends -- people little capable of inspiring any sentiment whatever in a young woman whose heart was above her position -- mme . bonacieux had remained insensible to vulgar seductions ; but at this period the title of gentleman had great influence with the citizen class , and d’artagnan was a gentleman . besides , he wore the uniform of the guards , which next to that of the musketeers was most admired by the ladies .",42
"when the first streaks of dawn appeared in the western horizon , the wind , which had slightly fallen , shifted two points , and enabled pencroft to enter the narrow gulf with greater ease .",6
"brave as they appeared to be , the two english gentlemen looked at each other hesitatingly . one might have thought there was in that cellar one of those famished ogres -- the gigantic heroes of popular legends , into whose cavern nobody could force their way with impunity .",3

"a square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall , approached by a double stair . from this central point two long corridors extended the whole length of the building , from which all the bedrooms opened . my own was in the same wing as baskerville 's and almost next door to it . these rooms appeared to be much more modern than the central part of the house , and the bright paper and numerous candles did something to remove the sombre impression which our arrival had left upon my mind .",60
"it appeared , therefore , as if the series of supernatural incidents was interrupted , although they often talked of them during the evenings in granite house , and they remained thoroughly resolved that the island should be searched , even in those parts the most difficult to explore .",1

"the cardinal is not the man to forget a mystification until he has settled account with the mystifier ; and the mystifier appears to me to have the air of being a certain young gascon of my acquaintance . """,22
"at the fifty - seventh second the door of the saloon opened ; and the pendulum had not beat the sixtieth second when phileas fogg appeared , followed by an excited crowd who had forced their way through the club doors , and in his calm voice , said , "" here i am , gentlemen ! """,25
"however , at that moment the engineer observed that the wire appeared to be slack , and on arriving at post no . 74 , herbert , who was in advance stopped , exclaiming,--",11
""" does not this appear strange to you ? "" asked harding of pencroft .",4
""" it appears fortunate , that 's all , "" answered the sailor .",2
""" nothing , "" replied gideon spilett , "" and the document appears even to have been recently written .",12
"mr . mason stood near the fire , talking to colonel and mrs . dent , and appeared as merry as any of them .",17
"it appeared best that pencroft and herbert , who knew how to work the vessel , should undertake the voyage alone .",1
"the weather was fine , the barometer was rising , the wind appeared settled , everything then was in favor of these brave men whom an act of humanity was taking far from their island .",12
at last the palisade appeared through the trees .,4
""" now , there is one , "" said kitty , "" who appears to me quite a different sort of a man from that poor monsieur d’artagnan . """,13
"towards the north , on the contrary , the bay widened , and a more rounded coast appeared , trending from the southwest to the northeast , and terminating in a slender cape .",17
"the question of boots and clothes -- assuredly a serious question,--that of light during the winter months , utilizing the fertile parts of the island , transforming the wild flora into cultivated flora , it all appeared easy to him ; cyrus harding helping , everything would be done in time .",36
"opposite the islet , the beach consisted first of sand , covered with black stones , which were now appearing little by little above the retreating tide .",19
on the upper plateau of the coast not a tree appeared .,10
"nothing , say you ? perhaps so ; nothing but a charming woman , who , strange as it may appear , made him the happiest of men ! truly , would you not for less than that make the tour around the world ?",20
these birds were the only beings that appeared to frequent this part of the ocean between tabor and lincoln islands .,7
"the entrance into this place i made to be , not by a door , but by a short ladder to go over the top ; which ladder , when i was in , i lifted over after me ; and so i was completely fenced in and fortified , as i thought , from all the world , and consequently slept secure in the night , which otherwise i could not have done ; though , as it appeared afterwards , there was no need of all this caution from the enemies that i apprehended danger from .",79
"besides , herbert discovered towards the southwest point of the lagoon a natural warren , a slightly damp meadow , covered with willows and aromatic herbs which scented the air , such as thyme , basil , savory , all the sweet - scented species of the labiated plants , which the rabbits appeared to be particularly fond of .",53
"i shudder as i recall these monsters to my remembrance . no human eye has ever beheld them living . they burdened this earth a thousand ages before man appeared , but their fossil remains , found in the argillaceous limestone called by the english the lias , have enabled their colossal structure to be perfectly built up again and anatomically ascertained .",29
"it appeared simplest to harding to make it of brick clay ; as creating an outlet for it to the upper plateau was not to be thought of , a hole was pierced in the granite above the window of the kitchen , and the pipe met it like that of an iron stove .",1
""" and moreover , "" said the reporter , "" it appears to be uninhabited . """,11
""" it seems you are right , planchet ; all this appears to be a little mysterious ; and be assured that we will not pay him our rent until the matter shall be categorically explained to us . """,11
at this place the wall appeared to have been separated by some violent subterranean force .,5
"this important point established , herbert looked for some cavity which would serve them as a retreat , but in vain ; everywhere the wall appeared smooth , plain , and perpendicular .",25
"herbert dozed again , but his sleep appeared more natural .",7
"_ may _ 16.—it had blown hard in the night , and the wreck appeared more broken by the force of the water ; but i stayed so long in the woods , to get pigeons for food , that the tide prevented my going to the wreck that day .",14
"for several hours the nautilus drifted in this brilliant tide , and our wonderment grew when we saw huge marine animals cavorting in it , like the fire - dwelling salamanders of myth . in the midst of these flames that did n't burn , i could see swift , elegant porpoises , the tireless pranksters of the seas , and sailfish three meters long , those shrewd heralds of hurricanes , whose fearsome broadswords sometimes banged against the lounge window . then smaller fish appeared : miscellaneous triggerfish , leather jacks , unicornfish , and a hundred others that left stripes on this luminous atmosphere in their course .",85
"i had climbed onto the platform just as the chief officer was taking his readings of hour angles . out of habit i waited for him to pronounce his daily phrase . but that day it was replaced by a different phrase , just as incomprehensible . almost at once i saw captain nemo appear , lift his spyglass , and inspect the horizon .",54
"the rainy season and the dry season began now to appear regular to me , and i learned to divide them so as to provide for them accordingly ; but i bought all my experience before i had it , and this i am going to relate was one of the most discouraging experiments that i made .",10
"this lighted for a minute a small room , which appeared perfectly empty .",10
"how strange a chequer - work of providence is the life of man ! and by what secret different springs are the affections hurried about , as different circumstances present ! to - day we love what to - morrow we hate ; to - day we seek what to - morrow we shun ; to - day we desire what to - morrow we fear , nay , even tremble at the apprehensions of . this was exemplified in me , at this time , in the most lively manner imaginable ; for i , whose only affliction was that i seemed banished from human society , that i was alone , circumscribed by the boundless ocean , cut off from mankind , and condemned to what i call silent life ; that i was as one whom heaven thought not worthy to be numbered among the living , or to appear among the rest of his creatures ; that to have seen one of my own species would have seemed to me a raising me from death to life , and the greatest blessing that heaven itself , next to the supreme blessing of salvation , could bestow ; i say , that i should now tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a man , and was ready to sink into the ground at but the shadow or silent appearance of a man having set his foot in the island .",152
how long the night appeared to the sailor and his companions !,4
the rocks which were visible appeared like amphibious monsters reposing in the surf .,5
"buckingham remained for a moment dazzled . never had anne of austria appeared to him so beautiful , amid balls , fetes , or carousals , as she appeared to him at this moment , dressed in a simple robe of white satin , and accompanied by donna estafania -- the only one of her spanish women who had not been driven from her by the jealousy of the king or by the persecutions of richelieu .",12
have the convicts appeared in the neighborhood ?,3
"as to the land itself , island or continent , it appeared fertile , agreeable in its aspect , and varied in its productions .",11
"besides , the wheels of a carriage , which appeared to have come from paris , had made a deep impression in the soft earth , which did not extend beyond the pavilion , but turned again toward paris .",9
"when i showed myself to the two hostages , it was with the captain , who told them i was the person the governor had ordered to look after them ; and that it was the governor ’s pleasure they should not stir anywhere but by my direction ; that if they did , they would be fetched into the castle , and be laid in irons : so that as we never suffered them to see me as governor , i now appeared as another person , and spoke of the governor , the garrison , the castle , and the like , upon all occasions .",83
"about seven o’clock in the evening , the boatman had taken over a young woman , wrapped in a black mantle , who appeared to be very anxious not to be recognized ; but entirely on account of her precautions , the boatman had paid more attention to her and discovered that she was young and pretty .",23
"first , there was the account - current of the produce of my farm or plantation , from the year when their fathers had balanced with my old portugal captain , being for six years ; the balance appeared to be one thousand one hundred and seventy - four moidores in my favour .",38
it soon appeared to him that he heard a slight noise within -- a timid noise which seemed to tremble lest it should be heard .,2
finally the ship 's rays appeared . their luminous trail guided us to the nautilus . by one o'clock we had returned .,5
"he credited this woman , who appeared to him the equal of a demon , with agents as supernatural as herself ; at the least noise , he imagined himself about to be arrested , and that planchet was being brought back to be confronted with himself and his friends .",6
"two of the men appeared , bearing the woman in their arms , and carried her to the carriage , into which the little old man got after her .",4
"wait quietly , then ; in two hours , in four , in six hours at latest , planchet will be here . he promised to be here , and i have very great faith in planchet , who appears to me to be a very good lad . """,39
the discovery of a completely unknown manuscript at a period in which historical science is carried to such a high degree appeared almost miraculous .,21
the good apothecary appeared a little puzzled .,3
"at last things appeared to be going on well , and if no complication occurred , herbert 's recovery might be regarded as certain .",3
"this speech appeared very reasonable to the oreillons ; they deputed two of their people with all expedition to inquire into the truth of this affair , who acquitted themselves of their commission like men of sense , and soon returned with good tidings for our distressed adventurers .",2
"but all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which was familiar to d’artagnan , and a well - known voice said , "" monsieur , i have brought your cloak ; it is chilly this evening . """,6
"d’artagnan felt a strong inclination to embrace planchet as he had embraced him on his departure ; but he feared lest this mark of affection , bestowed upon his lackey in the open street , might appear extraordinary to passers - by , and he restrained himself .",36
"as he was uttering these words the schoolmaster of the village appeared , who came to call the children to school .",11
"there was in all this , as may have been observed , one personage concerned , of whom , notwithstanding his precarious position , we have appeared to take but very little notice . this personage was m. bonacieux , the respectable martyr of the political and amorous intrigues which entangled themselves so nicely together at this gallant and chivalric period .",26
"top had not been sent again to him , as it appeared useless to expose the faithful dog to some shot which might deprive the settlers of their most useful auxiliary .",11
just then captain nemo and his chief officer appeared .,8
"he was like a wild animal , which appears stunned at first by its capture , and becomes wild again afterwards .",8
"the gentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his auditors ; and , as i have said , the auditors seeming to have great deference for the narrator , they every moment burst into fits of laughter .",2
well may he eschew the calm of domestic life ; it is not his element : there his faculties stagnate -- they can not develop or appear to advantage .,26
""" then , some fine day , "" said pencroft , who did not appear to be entirely convinced , "" the rest of this ancient continent may disappear in its turn , and there will be nothing between america and asia . """,14
""" well , young man , "" said he , "" we appear to pass rather gay nights !",12
"nine days after leaving the charente , pale with fatigue and vexation , milady saw only the blue coasts of finisterre appear .",21
"at least to me this explanation appears plausible . """,6
"it does not appear to be very clean in the crossroads . """,3
"however , the revolution which appeared upon his countenance was so visible that bonacieux was terrified at it , and he endeavored to draw back a step or two ; but as he was standing before the half of the door which was shut , the obstacle compelled him to keep his place .",5
""" your milady , "" said he , "" appears to be an infamous creature , but not the less you have done wrong to deceive her . in one fashion or another you have a terrible enemy on your hands . """,9
the commissary now appeared to experience a little uneasiness .,3
"thus engaged , he appeared , sitting in his own recess , quiet and absorbed enough ; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish- looking grammar , and wandering over , and sometimes fixing upon us , his fellow - students , with a curious intensity of observation : if caught , it would be instantly withdrawn ; yet ever and anon , it returned searchingly to our table .",4
"cacambo explained all the king 's bons mots to candide , and , although they were translated , they still appeared to be bons mots .",20
"the engineer was then informed of all that had passed during the voyage , and under what conditions the search had been conducted ; how the only dwelling in the island had long been abandoned ; how at last a castaway had been captured , who appeared no longer to belong to the human species .",46
"and so we arrived at a place where the shore was much narrowed . here the sea came to lap the foot of the steep cliff , leaving a passage no wider than a couple of yards . between two boldly projecting rocks appeared the mouth of a dark tunnel .",43
"he sat all night on his stool , starting at the least noise ; and when the first rays of the sun penetrated into his chamber , the dawn itself appeared to him to have taken funereal tints .",30
d’artagnan became pensive in his turn ; it appeared as if there were abysses in milady ’s soul whose depths were dark and unknown .,8
houses were no longer to be seen ; trees appeared in the darkness like great black phantoms chasing one another .,9
"this incident was , therefore , favorably interpreted at the corral , and it no longer appeared impossible that they should find ayrton again .",16
"the officer leaned forward , looked at her in his turn , and appeared surprised to see that face , just before so beautiful , distorted with passion and almost hideous .",13
"the inventory of the articles possessed by these castaways from the clouds , thrown upon a coast which appeared to be uninhabited , was soon made out .",18
"his interlocutor , whose head appeared through the carriage window , was a woman of from twenty to two - and - twenty years .",5
"however flattering this compliment , the officer made no reply ; but drawing from his belt a little silver whistle , such as boatswains use in ships of war , he whistled three times , with three different modulations . immediately several men appeared , who unharnessed the smoking horses , and put the carriage into a coach house .",43
"however , according to pencroft 's advice , it appeared best to wait a few days before commencing an exploration .",9
upon this there appeared such a crowd of candidates that a large fleet could not have contained them .,3
"candide , willing to choose from among those who appeared most likely to answer his intention , selected twenty , who seemed to him the most sociable , and who all pretended to merit the preference .",9
"there he again appeared uneasy and embarrassed , and stopped for the third time .",3
"athos went round the house before he could distinguish the door , amid the red color in which the house was painted . no light appeared through the chinks of the shutters ; no noise gave reason to believe that it was inhabited . it was dark and silent as the tomb .",25
"at the third knock , however , steps were heard inside . the door at length was opened , and a man appeared , of high stature , pale complexion , and black hair and beard .",22
"these steps drew near to his dungeon , the door was thrown open , and the guards appeared .",17
"the opposite shore appeared to be more uneven , and the valley of which the river occupied the bottom was more clearly visible .",3
"at the end of three - quarters of a league , within fifty paces of festubert , a larger bloodstain appeared ; the ground was trampled by horses .",20
the wood appeared as deserted as on the day when the colonists first landed on the island .,2
"however , some birds sang and fluttered in the foliage , and appeared very timid , as if man had inspired them with an instinctive fear .",12
"alice was not much surprised at this , she was getting so used to queer things happening . while she was looking at the place where it had been , it suddenly appeared again .",32
""" i tell you i am sure of it , "" continued the host . "" when i informed him that your lordship was the protege of monsieur de treville , and that you even had a letter for that illustrious gentleman , he appeared to be very much disturbed , and asked me where that letter was , and immediately came down into the kitchen , where he knew your doublet was . """,44
"arrived at the spot on which grew the first beautiful trees of the forest , their foliage slightly agitated by the breeze , the stranger appeared greedily to drink in the penetrating odor which filled the atmosphere , and a long sigh escaped from his chest .",25
"milady remained thoughtful and undecided for a moment ; then , as if appearing to have formed a resolution , she said , "" i have an enemy . """,13
"five meters away a shadow appeared and dropped to the seafloor . the alarming idea of sharks crossed my mind . but i was mistaken , and once again we did n't have to deal with monsters of the deep .",5
"two days after this occurrence , the stranger appeared to wish gradually to mingle with their common life .",8
"the latter obeyed without reply , and entered the chamber , where he appeared to be expected .",13
"the time thus passed away pleasantly , these brave men not appearing to have any fears for the future .",11
"the poor mercer remained standing at the door , while the eyes of the personage we have just described were fixed upon him , and appeared to wish to penetrate even into the depths of the past .",25
"the court of his hotel , situated in the rue du vieux - colombier , resembled a camp from by six o’clock in the morning in summer and eight o’clock in winter . from fifty to sixty musketeers , who appeared to replace one another in order always to present an imposing number , paraded constantly , armed to the teeth and ready for anything .",40
""" it appeared to me-- """,2
""" yes ! there is some mystery in that man 's life , "" said gideon spilett , "" and it appears as if he had only re - entered society by the path of remorse . """,21
""" yes , monseigneur ; but these suspicions appeared to be disagreeable to monsieur the commissary , and i no longer have them . """,8
"however , after two hours , appearing to have formed a resolution , he came to find cyrus harding .",6
"the grouse were fastened by their claws , and pencroft , delighted at not having to appear before their companions with empty hands , and observing that the day had begun to decline , judged it best to return to their dwelling .",16
"there followed between these two personages a strange silence , during which the sound of a slow and regular step was heard approaching . shortly a human form appeared in the shade of the corridor , and the young lieutenant , with whom we are already acquainted , stopped at the threshold to receive the orders of the baron .",28
"he appeared anxious , timorous , ashamed , and his eyes were constantly fixed on the ground .",1
"there , to his great astonishment , d’artagnan heard the policy which made all europe tremble criticized aloud and openly , as well as the private life of the cardinal , which so many great nobles had been punished for trying to pry into . that great man who was so revered by d’artagnan the elder served as an object of ridicule to the musketeers of treville , who cracked their jokes upon his bandy legs and his crooked back . some sang ballads about mme . d’aguillon , his mistress , and mme . cambalet , his niece ; while others formed parties and plans to annoy the pages and guards of the cardinal duke -- all things which appeared to d’artagnan monstrous impossibilities .",120
"nevertheless , when the name of the king was now and then uttered unthinkingly amid all these cardinal jests , a sort of gag seemed to close for a moment on all these jeering mouths . they looked hesitatingly around them , and appeared to doubt the thickness of the partition between them and the office of m. de treville ; but a fresh allusion soon brought back the conversation to his eminence , and then the laughter recovered its loudness and the light was not withheld from any of his actions .",43
her lips were cold ; it appeared to d’artagnan that he had embraced a statue .,6
"on february 8 , as early as the first hours of daylight , mocha appeared before us : a town now in ruins , whose walls would collapse at the mere sound of a cannon , and which shelters a few leafy date trees here and there . this once - important city used to contain six public marketplaces plus twenty - six mosques , and its walls , protected by fourteen forts , fashioned a three - kilometer girdle around it .",14
"i remember but little of the journey ; i only know that the day seemed to me of a preternatural length , and that we appeared to travel over hundreds of miles of road .",25
"then the nautilus drew near the beaches of africa , where the sea is considerably deeper . there , through the open panels and in a midwater of crystal clarity , our ship enabled us to study wonderful bushes of shining coral and huge chunks of rock wrapped in splendid green furs of algae and fucus . what an indescribable sight , and what a variety of settings and scenery where these reefs and volcanic islands leveled off by the libyan coast ! but soon the nautilus hugged the eastern shore where these tree forms appeared in all their glory . this was off the coast of tihama , and there such zoophyte displays not only flourished below sea level but they also fashioned picturesque networks that unreeled as high as ten fathoms above it ; the latter were more whimsical but less colorful than the former , which kept their bloom thanks to the moist vitality of the waters .",95
"this execution quieted the ill - disposed , who resolved to allow themselves to die of hunger -- this death always appearing to them more slow and less sure than strangulation .",21
"this other musketeer formed a perfect contrast to his interrogator , who had just designated him by the name of aramis . he was a stout man , of about two- or three - and - twenty , with an open , ingenuous countenance , a black , mild eye , and cheeks rosy and downy as an autumn peach . his delicate mustache marked a perfectly straight line upon his upper lip ; he appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their veins should swell , and he pinched the tips of his ears from time to time to preserve their delicate pink transparency .",75
"habitually he spoke little and slowly , bowed frequently , laughed without noise , showing his teeth , which were fine and of which , as the rest of his person , he appeared to take great care .",33
"this affirmation appeared to dispel all doubts with regard to the baldric . they continued to admire it , but said no more about it ; and with a rapid change of thought , the conversation passed suddenly to another subject .",2
"the lady i had left might be about twenty - nine ; the one who went with me appeared some years younger : the first impressed me by her voice , look , and air .",18
"it appeared best to introduce something solid into the bill of fare , for all needed to get up their strength .",1
"the question of carrying the city by assault , though often debated in the council of the king , had been always rejected . in the first place , la rochelle appeared impregnable . then the cardinal , whatever he said , very well knew that the horror of bloodshed in this encounter , in which frenchman would combat against frenchman , was a retrograde movement of sixty years impressed upon his policy ; and the cardinal was at that period what we now call a man of progress .",31
""" do n’t be afraid ; he is not so much of a devil as he appears . """,16
"saying these words , d’artagnan went upstairs , leaving his host a little better satisfied with respect to two things in which he appeared to be very much interested -- his debt and his life .",23
""" no doubt , "" and yet the document appears to have been recently written !",9
"not only did it now appear to be uninhabited by any but themselves , but the colonists were compelled to believe that it never had been inhabited .",5
"the sailor 's reasoning was very just , and pointed out an incomprehensible fact , for the document appeared to have been recently written , when the colonists found it in the bottle .",18
"at eight o'clock neb had not appeared , but there was no doubt that the frightful weather alone hindered his return , and that he must have taken refuge in some cave , to await the end of the storm or at least the return of day .",6
""" ah ! dear sir , "" said pacquette , "" this is one of the miseries of the trade ; yesterday i was stripped and beaten by an officer ; yet today i must appear good humored and gay to please a friar . """,35
"on the 10th of november , about eight o'clock in the evening , as night was coming on , the stranger appeared unexpectedly before the settlers , who were assembled under the veranda .",21
"making a sign to la houdiniere and cahusac to stop , he alighted from his horse , and went toward these suspected merry companions , hoping , by means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge which concealed his approach , to catch some words of this conversation which appeared so interesting . at ten paces from the hedge he recognized the talkative gascon ; and as he had already perceived that these men were musketeers , he did not doubt that the three others were those called the inseparables ; that is to say , athos , porthos , and aramis .",56
"but he also was spurred on by a ferocious desire of vengeance . he wished to subdue this woman in his own name ; and as this vengeance appeared to him to have a certain sweetness in it , he could not make up his mind to renounce it .",28
"it appeared so , as soon he was heard to express himself in these incoherent sentences:-- "" why am i here ? ....",1
""" but your host behaves very well toward you , as it appears , my dear porthos , "" said d’artagnan , directing the sick man ’s attention to the full stewpans and the empty bottles .",12
""" it does not signify , gentlemen , "" continued the cardinal , without appearing to be in the least swerved from his first intention by the diversion which athos had started , "" it does not signify , gentlemen . i do not like to have simple soldiers , because they have the advantage of serving in a privileged corps , thus to play the great lords ; discipline is the same for them as for everybody else .

"alice waited till the eyes appeared , and then nodded . ' it 's no use speaking to it , ' she thought , ' till its ears have come , or at least one of them .

""" he shall die , then , since you condemn him ! "" said d’artagnan , in so firm a tone that it appeared to milady an undoubted proof of devotion .",23
"it appeared as if this signal had been waited for ; the barking immediately came nearer , and soon a dog bounded into the passage .",1
""" in the course of the day madame de lannoy , in her quality of tire - woman of the queen , looked for this casket , appeared uneasy at not finding it , and at length asked information of the queen . """,27
"the moment alice appeared , she was appealed to by all three to settle the question , and they repeated their arguments to her , though , as they all spoke at once , she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said .",3
"it appeared inexplicable , above all , in the midst of this black night and in such a tempest !",1
"on the right and on the left of the road , which the dismal procession pursued , appeared a few low , stunted trees , which looked like deformed dwarfs crouching down to watch men traveling at this sinister hour .",17
"during all this time , the convicts did not once appear in the vicinity of granite house .",10
"upon my honor , this man fancies the world belongs to him . there you stood , stammering , stupefied , annihilated . one might have supposed the bastille appeared before you , and that the gigantic medusa had converted you into stone .",29
""" i must acknowledge one thing , "" said herbert , "" it is that captain harding appears rather to fear than desire the presence of human beings on our island . """,17
""" that he is far from being , or rather having been , so guilty toward you as he appears . """,19
"on the left , the country appeared to be one vast extent of sandy downs , bristling with thistles .",6
"our bearnais was a prudent lad , however young he might be . consequently he had appeared to believe all that the vainglorious musketeer had told him , convinced that no friendship will hold out against a surprised secret . besides , we feel always a sort of mental superiority over those whose lives we know better than they suppose .",16
the country appeared an absolute desert .,2
"and , in fact , in several places they could distinguish traces , more or less recent , of the passage of a band of men -- here branches broken off the trees , perhaps to mark out the way ; there the ashes of a fire , and footprints in clayey spots ; but nothing which appeared to belong to a settled encampment .",57
"at first , being little accustomed to learn by heart , the lessons appeared to me both long and difficult ; the frequent change from task to task , too , bewildered me ; and i was glad when , about three o'clock in the afternoon , miss smith put into my hands a border of muslin two yards long , together with needle , thimble , & c. , and sent me to sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom , with directions to hem the same .",13
"the lesson had comprised part of the reign of charles i. , and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship- money , which most of them appeared unable to answer ; still , every little difficulty was solved instantly when it reached burns : her memory seemed to have retained the substance of the whole lesson , and she was ready with answers on every point .",29
""" it appears so , "" replied herbert , who could not understand it at all , and was gazing at the stones scattered on the sand .",2
"the silence was scarcely disturbed by the howling of jaguars and the chattering of the monkeys , the latter appearing to particularly irritate master jup .",19
"there were two slaves among the crew of the galley , who rowed very ill , and to whose bare backs the master of the vessel frequently applied a lash . candide , from natural sympathy , looked at these two slaves more attentively than at any of the rest , and drew near them with an eye of pity . their features , though greatly disfigured , appeared to him to bear a strong resemblance with those of pangloss and the unhappy baron jesuit , miss cunegund 's brother .",68
"i must have been mad to allow myself to be carried away so , "" says she , gazing into the glass , which reflects back to her eyes the burning glance by which she appears to interrogate herself .",35

""" within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that sir charles 's nervous system was strained to the breaking point . he had taken this legend which i have read you exceedingly to heart -- so much so that , although he would walk in his own grounds , nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at night . incredible as it may appear to you , mr . holmes , he was honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his family , and certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors were not encouraging . the idea of some ghastly presence constantly haunted him , and on more than one occasion he has asked me whether i had on my medical journeys at night ever seen any strange creature or heard the baying of a hound . the latter question he put to me several times , and always with a voice which vibrated with excitement .",70
"neb , who was bending over him , spoke , but the engineer did not appear to hear , and his eyes remained closed .",15
"neb , herbert , and pencroft chatted , while examining this part of their domain , which was new to them , and , in proportion as the canoe proceeded towards the south , the two mandible capes appeared to move , and surround union bay more closely .",38
"as to cyrus harding , he did not speak ; he simply gazed , and by the mistrust which his look expressed , it appeared that he was examining some strange country .",24
at eight o'clock the day appeared far enough advanced for the reconnaissance to be made under favorable conditions .,5
"he recounted all the events with which cyrus was unacquainted , the last fall of the balloon , the landing on this unknown land , which appeared a desert ( whatever it was , whether island or continent ) , the discovery of the chimneys , the search for him , not forgetting of course neb 's devotion , the intelligence exhibited by the faithful top , as well as many other matters .",26
"candide , as he was returning home , made profound reflections on the turk 's discourse . "" this good old man , "" said he to pangloss and martin , "" appears to me to have chosen for himself a lot much preferable to that of the six kings with whom we had the honor to sup . """,32
"before she went to bed she had pondered , analyzed , turned on all sides , examined on all points , the words , the steps , the gestures , the signs , and even the silence of her interlocutors ; and of this profound , skillful , and anxious study the result was that felton , everything considered , appeared the more vulnerable of her two persecutors .",60
"thirty feet distant was the gate of the corral , which appeared to be closed .",11
"this done , the captain pressed a button whose wiring was in communication with the crew 's quarters . four men appeared and , not without difficulty , pushed the chest out of the lounge . then i heard them hoist it up the iron companionway by means of pulleys .",21
"the water did not appear to have penetrated to the inside , and the articles which it contained were no doubt uninjured .",4
"one thing was certain , that it was possible to reach the palisade without being seen , and also that it did not appear to be guarded .",23
d’artagnan and the curate appeared pleased .,4
"for two years , three years , this went on , but ayrton , humbled by solitude , always looking for some ship to appear on the horizon , asking himself if the time of expiation would soon be complete , suffered as none other suffered !",24
"neither the weapons nor the instruments , contrary to the usual custom , bore the name of the maker ; they were , besides , in a perfect state , and did not appear to have been used .",33
""" a document ? "" repeated ayrton , who did not appear to know what he meant .",11
""" it appears , "" said the baron , seating himself in the armchair opposite that occupied by milady , and stretching out his legs carelessly upon the hearth , "" it appears we have made a little apostasy ! """,2
"the same with the bible printed in english , in quarto , remarkable from a typographic point of view , and which appeared to have been often used .",22
but did it not appear as if providence had wished to reward them by sending them these productions of human industry ?,4
"this accident , which appeared so very serious to pencroft , produced different effects on the companions of the honest sailor .",4
"in the midst of the watery mass , brightly lit by our electric beams , there snaked past those one - meter lampreys that are common to nearly every clime . a type of ray from the genus oxyrhynchus , five feet wide , had a white belly with a spotted , ash - gray back and was carried along by the currents like a huge , wide - open shawl . other rays passed by so quickly i could n't tell if they deserved that name "" eagle ray "" coined by the ancient greeks , or those designations of "" rat ray , "" "" bat ray , "" and "" toad ray "" that modern fishermen have inflicted on them . dogfish known as topes , twelve feet long and especially feared by divers , were racing with each other . looking like big bluish shadows , thresher sharks went by , eight feet long and gifted with an extremely acute sense of smell . dorados from the genus sparus , some measuring up to thirteen decimeters , appeared in silver and azure costumes encircled with ribbons , which contrasted with the dark color of their fins ; fish sacred to the goddess venus , their eyes set in brows of gold ; a valuable species that patronizes all waters fresh or salt , equally at home in rivers , lakes , and oceans , living in every clime , tolerating any temperature , their line dating back to prehistoric times on this earth yet preserving all its beauty from those far - off days . magnificent sturgeons , nine to ten meters long and extremely fast , banged their powerful tails against the glass of our panels , showing bluish backs with small brown spots ; they resemble sharks , without equaling their strength , and are encountered in every sea ; in the spring they delight in swimming up the great rivers , fighting the currents of the volga , danube , po , rhine , loire , and oder , while feeding on herring , mackerel , salmon , and codfish ; although they belong to the class of cartilaginous fish , they rate as a delicacy ; they 're eaten fresh , dried , marinated , or salt - preserved , and in olden times they were borne in triumph to the table of the roman epicure lucullus . but whenever the nautilus drew near the surface , those denizens of the mediterranean i could observe most productively belonged to the sixty - third genus of bony fish . these were tuna from the genus scomber , blue - black on top , silver on the belly armor , their dorsal stripes giving off a golden gleam . they are said to follow ships in search of refreshing shade from the hot tropical sun , and they did just that with the nautilus , as they had once done with the vessels of the count de la pérouse . for long hours they competed in speed with our submersible . i could n't stop marveling at these animals so perfectly cut out for racing , their heads small , their bodies sleek , spindle - shaped , and in some cases over three meters long , their pectoral fins gifted with remarkable strength , their caudal fins forked . like certain flocks of birds , whose speed they equal , these tuna swim in triangle formation , which prompted the ancients to say they 'd boned up on geometry and military strategy . and yet they ca n't escape the provençal fishermen , who prize them as highly as did the ancient inhabitants of turkey and italy ; and these valuable animals , as oblivious as if they were deaf and blind , leap right into the marseilles tuna nets and perish by the thousands .",181
