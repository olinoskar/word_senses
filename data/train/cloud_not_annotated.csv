"but more was to come , when , with a rush through clouds of bone dust , he laid his hand upon a bare skull , and cried with a voice trembling with excitement :",12
"the stream widened as they went further on , till at length it passed under one of the frightful rocks , whose summits seemed to reach the clouds .",27
"breathing that sea breeze , so much more invigorating and balsamic as the land is approached , contemplating all the power of those preparations she was commissioned to destroy , all the power of that army which she was to combat alone -- she , a woman with a few bags of gold -- milady compared herself mentally to judith , the terrible jewess , when she penetrated the camp of the assyrians and beheld the enormous mass of chariots , horses , men , and arms , which a gesture of her hand was to dissipate like a cloud of smoke .",99
"still bright on clouds of suffering dim shines that soft , solemn joy ; nor care i now , how dense and grim disasters gather nigh .",3
"october 16th.--a dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain . the house is banked in with rolling clouds , which rise now and then to show the dreary curves of the moor , with thin , silver veins upon the sides of the hills , and the distant boulders gleaming where the light strikes upon their wet faces . it is melancholy outside and in . the baronet is in a black reaction after the excitements of the night . i am conscious myself of a weight at my heart and a feeling of impending danger -- ever present danger , which is the more terrible because i am unable to define it .",19
"he seemed about to give up all hope , when he espied , anchored at the battery , a cable 's length off at most , a trading vessel , with a screw , well - shaped , whose funnel , puffing a cloud of smoke , indicated that she was getting ready for departure .",43
"she broke forth as never moon yet burst from cloud : a hand first penetrated the sable folds and waved them away ; then , not a moon , but a white human form shone in the azure , inclining a glorious brow earthward .",9
"the inventory of the articles possessed by these castaways from the clouds , thrown upon a coast which appeared to be uninhabited , was soon made out .",11
""" very dimly -- each is a luminous cloud . """,8
"now , one evening when d’artagnan , who was in the trenches , was not able to accompany them , athos , porthos , and aramis , mounted on their battle steeds , enveloped in their war cloaks , with their hands upon their pistol butts , were returning from a drinking place called the red dovecot , which athos had discovered two days before upon the route to jarrie , following the road which led to the camp and quite on their guard , as we have stated , for fear of an ambuscade , when , about a quarter of a league from the village of boisnau , they fancied they heard the sound of horses approaching them . they immediately all three halted , closed in , and waited , occupying the middle of the road . in an instant , and as the moon broke from behind a cloud , they saw at a turning of the road two horsemen who , on perceiving them , stopped in their turn , appearing to deliberate whether they should continue their route or go back .",152
"i lingered ; the moon shut herself wholly within her chamber , and drew close her curtain of dense cloud : the night grew dark ; rain came driving fast on the gale .",19
""" the third , then , fell from the clouds , i suppose ? """,9
"at noon the sun made a momentary appearance . taking advantage of this rift in the clouds , the chief officer took the orb 's altitude . then the sea grew turbulent , we went below again , and the hatch closed once more .",16
"at six o'clock the day broke suddenly , with that speed unique to tropical regions , which experience no real dawn or dusk . the sun 's rays pierced the cloud curtain gathered on the easterly horizon , and the radiant orb rose swiftly .",30
"nothing else until the moment when , through a rift in the clouds , i saw the daring captain clinging to one of the animal 's fins , fighting the monster at close quarters , belaboring his enemy 's belly with stabs of the dagger yet unable to deliver the deciding thrust , in other words , a direct hit to the heart . in its struggles the man - eater churned the watery mass so furiously , its eddies threatened to knock me over .",12
"i see at intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close - set bars of a cage : a vivid , restless , resolute captive is there ; were it but free , it would soar cloud - high . you are still bent on going ? """,40
and jup gravely puffed out clouds of smoke which seemed to give him great satisfaction .,5
"a sandy beach unfolded before us , measuring 500 feet at its widest point between the waters of the lake and the foot of the mountain 's walls . via this strand you could easily circle the lake . but the base of these high walls consisted of broken soil over which there lay picturesque piles of volcanic blocks and enormous pumice stones . all these crumbling masses were covered with an enamel polished by the action of underground fires , and they glistened under the stream of electric light from our beacon . stirred up by our footsteps , the mica - rich dust on this beach flew into the air like a cloud of sparks .",114
"by then the frigate lay in latitude 31 degrees 15 ' north and longitude 136 degrees 42 ' east . the shores of japan were less than 200 miles to our leeward . night was coming on . eight o'clock had just struck . huge clouds covered the moon 's disk , then in its first quarter . the sea undulated placidly beneath the frigate 's stempost .",45
"almost immediately a louder report was heard , a cloud of smoke issued from the brig 's side , and a ball , striking the summit of the rock which sheltered ayrton and pencroft , made it fly in splinters , but the two marksmen remained unhurt .",9
"i likewise marveled at the numerous medusas , including the most beautiful of their breed , the compass jellyfish , unique to the falkland seas . some of these jellyfish were shaped like very smooth , semispheric parasols with russet stripes and fringes of twelve neat festoons . others looked like upside - down baskets from which wide leaves and long red twigs were gracefully trailing . they swam with quiverings of their four leaflike arms , letting the opulent tresses of their tentacles dangle in the drift . i wanted to preserve a few specimens of these delicate zoophytes , but they were merely clouds , shadows , illusions , melting and evaporating outside their native element .",105
"it was on the 3rd of january that herbert , having ascended at daybreak to the plateau of prospect heights to harness one of the onagers , perceived an enormous hat - shaped cloud rolling from the summit of the volcano .",33
i used to look at my master 's face to see if it were sad or fierce ; but i could not remember the time when it had been so uniformly clear of clouds or evil feelings .,33
"where the sun had gone down in simple state -- pure of the pomp of clouds -- spread a solemn purple , burning with the light of red jewel and furnace flame at one point , on one hill - peak , and extending high and wide , soft and still softer , over half heaven .",15
"the words in these introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes , and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray ; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast ; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking .",50
"the clouds were slightly raised , and the wind , though less damp , was very sharp and cold .",1
"yes , a dangerous matter — so dangerous that even the most saintly dared only whisper their religious opinions with bated breath , lest something which fell from their lips might be misconstrued , and bring down a swift retribution upon them . the victims of persecution had now turned persecutors on their own account , and persecutors of the most terrible description . not the inquisition of seville , nor the german vehm - gericht , nor the secret societies of italy , were ever able to put a more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over the state of utah .",100
"the night was dark . the moon , on the wane , scarcely left the horizon , and was covered with heavy clouds ; the height of the trees deepened the darkness .",22
"the old rajah was not dead , then , since he rose of a sudden , like a spectre , took up his wife in his arms , and descended from the pyre in the midst of the clouds of smoke , which only heightened his ghostly appearance .",38
"i feel peculiar sensations , like many creatures on earth at the approach of violent atmospheric changes . the heavily voluted cumulus clouds lower gloomily and threateningly ; they wear that implacable look which i have sometimes noticed at the outbreak of a great storm . the air is heavy ; the sea is calm .",22
at ten in the morning the symptoms of storm become aggravated . the wind never lulls but to acquire increased strength ; the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts and rushing storms .,27
"the mast yet holds firm . the sail stretches tight like a bubble ready to burst . the raft flies at a rate that i can not reckon , but not so fast as the foaming clouds of spray which it dashes from side to side in its headlong speed .",36
"but the skies became more and more threatening . there were conspicuous signs of a hurricane on the way . the atmosphere was turning white and milky . slender sheaves of cirrus clouds were followed on the horizon by layers of nimbocumulus . other low clouds fled swiftly . the sea grew towering , inflated by long swells . every bird had disappeared except a few petrels , friends of the storms . the barometer fell significantly , indicating a tremendous tension in the surrounding haze . the mixture in our stormglass decomposed under the influence of the electricity charging the air . a struggle of the elements was approaching .",32
"a fragrant blue cloud soon arose , and from its depths a voice was heard repeating excitedly,--",3
"another unusual effect . heavy clouds passed above us , forming and fading swiftly . but after thinking it over , i realized that these so - called clouds were caused simply by the changing densities of the long ground swells , and i even spotted the foaming "" white caps "" that their breaking crests were proliferating over the surface of the water . lastly , i could n't help seeing the actual shadows of large birds passing over our heads , swiftly skimming the surface of the sea .",28
