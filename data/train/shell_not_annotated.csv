"before returning to the cave , the sailor and herbert , in the event of fire being positively unattainable , collected some more shell - fish , and then silently retraced their steps to their dwelling .",23
""" with all due respect to master -- gracious ! "" conseil put in , shaking off the water that had sprayed over him from another shell . "" with all due respect to master , they 've discovered the narwhale and they 're cannonading the same . """,26
"as to gideon spilett , he devoured the shell - fish , then he laid himself down on the sand , at the foot of a rock .",8
"there dillon collected many relics of the shipwreck : iron utensils , anchors , eyelets from pulleys , swivel guns , an eighteen - pound shell , the remains of some astronomical instruments , a piece of sternrail , and a bronze bell bearing the inscription "" made by bazin , "" the foundry mark at brest arsenal around 1785 . there could no longer be any doubt .",25
"herbert offered him a few handfuls of shell - fish and sargassum , saying,--",7
pencroft 's first thought was to use the fire by preparing a more nourishing supper than a dish of shell - fish .,19
"i would have been deeply interested in visiting this long , 360-league reef , against which the ever - surging sea broke with the fearsome intensity of thunderclaps . but just then the nautilus 's slanting fins took us to great depths , and i could see nothing of those high coral walls . i had to rest content with the various specimens of fish brought up by our nets . among others i noted some long - finned albacore , a species in the genus scomber , as big as tuna , bluish on the flanks , and streaked with crosswise stripes that disappear when the animal dies . these fish followed us in schools and supplied our table with very dainty flesh . we also caught a large number of yellow - green gilthead , half a decimeter long and tasting like dorado , plus some flying gurnards , authentic underwater swallows that , on dark nights , alternately streak air and water with their phosphorescent glimmers . among mollusks and zoophytes , i found in our trawl 's meshes various species of alcyonarian coral , sea urchins , hammer shells , spurred - star shells , wentletrap snails , horn shells , glass snails . the local flora was represented by fine floating algae : sea tangle , and kelp from the genus macrocystis , saturated with the mucilage their pores perspire , from which i selected a wonderful nemastoma geliniaroidea , classifying it with the natural curiosities in the museum .",192

""" no , you do n't feel it now . some day , when you are old and wrinkled and ugly , when thought has seared your forehead with its lines , and passion branded your lips with its hideous fires , you will feel it , you will feel it terribly . now , wherever you go , you charm the world . will it always be so ? . . . you have a wonderfully beautiful face , mr . gray . do n't frown . you have . and beauty is a form of genius-- is higher , indeed , than genius , as it needs no explanation . it is of the great facts of the world , like sunlight , or spring - time , or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon . it can not be questioned . it has its divine right of sovereignty . it makes princes of those who have it .",139
"aside and in special compartments , strings of supremely beautiful pearls were spread out , the electric light flecking them with little fiery sparks : pink pearls pulled from saltwater fan shells in the red sea ; green pearls from the rainbow abalone ; yellow , blue , and black pearls , the unusual handiwork of various mollusks from every ocean and of certain mussels from rivers up north ; in short , several specimens of incalculable worth that had been oozed by the rarest of shellfish . some of these pearls were bigger than a pigeon egg ; they more than equaled the one that the explorer tavernier sold the shah of persia for 3,000,000 francs , and they surpassed that other pearl owned by the imam of muscat , which i had believed to be unrivaled in the entire world .",31
"the shellfish meleagrina , that womb for pearls whose valves are nearly equal in size , has the shape of a round shell with thick walls and a very rough exterior . some of these shells were furrowed with flaky , greenish bands that radiated down from the top . these were the young oysters . the others had rugged black surfaces , measured up to fifteen centimeters in width , and were ten or more years old .",35
"at this place the beach was covered with little mounds , concealing perfectly spherical turtles ' eggs , with white hard shells , the albumen of which does not coagulate as that of birds ' eggs .",21
"a bag was filled with the crustaceae , whose shells were of a cobalt blue . the settlers then pushed on .",9
""" i dreamt another dream , sir : that thornfield hall was a dreary ruin , the retreat of bats and owls . i thought that of all the stately front nothing remained but a shell - like wall , very high and very fragile - looking . i wandered , on a moonlight night , through the grass- grown enclosure within : here i stumbled over a marble hearth , and there over a fallen fragment of cornice .",35
"and , as we shall not fire from the windows of granite house , the pirates will not think of causing irreparable damage by throwing shell against it .",25
"the engineer then took a flat stone which he had brought back from one of his previous excursions , a sort of slate , on which it was easy to trace figures with a sharp shell .",35
"nothing could be seen there but sand and shells , mingled with debris of lava .",8
"some zoophytes were dredged up by the chain of our trawl . most were lovely sea anemone belonging to the family actinidia , including among other species , the phyctalis protexta , native to this part of the ocean : a small cylindrical trunk adorned with vertical lines , mottled with red spots , and crowned by a wondrous blossoming of tentacles . as for mollusks , they consisted of exhibits i had already observed : turret snails , olive shells of the "" tent olive "" species with neatly intersecting lines and russet spots standing out sharply against a flesh - colored background , fanciful spider conchs that looked like petrified scorpions , transparent glass snails , argonauts , some highly edible cuttlefish , and certain species of squid that the naturalists of antiquity classified with the flying fish , which are used chiefly as bait for catching cod .",80
"having nothing better to do , i decided to dredge these beautiful , clear waters , which exhibited a profusion of shells , zoophytes , and open - sea plants . besides , it was the last day the nautilus would spend in these waterways , if , tomorrow , it still floated off to the open sea as captain nemo had promised .",21
"for two hours our fishing proceeded energetically but without bringing up any rarities . our dragnet was filled with midas abalone , harp shells , obelisk snails , and especially the finest hammer shells i had seen to that day . we also gathered in a few sea cucumbers , some pearl oysters , and a dozen small turtles that we saved for the ship 's pantry .",23

"but just when i least expected it , i laid my hands on a wonder , a natural deformity i 'd have to call it , something very seldom encountered . conseil had just made a cast of the dragnet , and his gear had come back up loaded with a variety of fairly ordinary seashells , when suddenly he saw me plunge my arms swiftly into the net , pull out a shelled animal , and give a conchological yell , in other words , the most piercing yell a human throat can produce .",73
"the same nervous staccato laugh broke from her thin lips , and her fingers began to play with a long tortoise - shell paper - knife .",22
""" this shell , "" i said , displaying the subject of my triumph .",2
""" but that 's simply an olive shell of the ' tent olive ' species , genus oliva , order pectinibranchia , class gastropoda , branch mollusca-- """,7
""" yes , yes , conseil ! but instead of coiling from right to left , this olive shell rolls from left to right ! """,18

"this was only invincible obstinacy . i could hold out no longer . i picked up a perfectly formed shell , which had belonged to an animal not unlike the woodlouse : then , joining my uncle , i said :",19
"how many other marvelous new specimens i still could have observed if , little by little , the nautilus had n't settled to the lower strata ! its slanting fins drew it to depths of 2,000 and 3,500 meters . there animal life was represented by nothing more than sea lilies , starfish , delightful crinoids with bell - shaped heads like little chalices on straight stems , top - shell snails , blood - red tooth shells , and fissurella snails , a large species of coastal mollusk .",70

"our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons burden , carried six guns and fourteen men , besides the master , his boy , and myself . we had on board no large cargo of goods , except of such toys as were fit for our trade with the negroes , such as beads , bits of glass , shells , and other trifles , especially little looking - glasses , knives , scissors , hatchets , and the like .",60

the pirate 's design was now only too evident ; he wished to bring her broadside to bear on the chimneys and from there to reply with shell and ball to the shot which had till then decimated her crew .,27
"on these rocks , in the midst of slippery wrack , abounded bivalve shell - fish , not to be despised by starving people .",13
"they belong to that species of molluscous perforators which excavate holes in the hardest stone ; their shell is rounded at both ends , a feature which is not remarked in the common mussel .",17
"pencroft had kept his promise , and a light boat , the shell of which was joined together by the flexible twigs of the crejimba , had been constructed in five days .",12
"anyone consulting conseil would soon learn from the gallant lad that the branch mollusca is divided into five classes ; that the first class features the cephalopoda ( whose members are sometimes naked , sometimes covered with a shell ) , which consists of two families , the dibranchiata and the tetrabranchiata , which are distinguished by their number of gills ; that the family dibranchiata includes three genera , the argonaut , the squid , and the cuttlefish , and that the family tetrabranchiata contains only one genus , the nautilus . after this catalog , if some recalcitrant listener confuses the argonaut , which is acetabuliferous ( in other words , a bearer of suction tubes ) , with the nautilus , which is tentaculiferous ( a bearer of tentacles ) , it will be simply unforgivable .",38
"captain nemo walked in front , and his companion followed us a few steps to the rear . conseil and i stayed next to each other , as if daydreaming that through our metal carapaces , a little polite conversation might still be possible ! already i no longer felt the bulkiness of my clothes , footwear , and air tank , nor the weight of the heavy sphere inside which my head was rattling like an almond in its shell . once immersed in water , all these objects lost a part of their weight equal to the weight of the liquid they displaced , and thanks to this law of physics discovered by archimedes , i did just fine . i was no longer an inert mass , and i had , comparatively speaking , great freedom of movement .",80
"the vegetation on this desolate continent struck me as quite limited . a few lichens of the species usnea melanoxanthra sprawled over the black rocks . the whole meager flora of this region consisted of certain microscopic buds , rudimentary diatoms made up of a type of cell positioned between two quartz - rich shells , plus long purple and crimson fucus plants , buoyed by small air bladders and washed up on the coast by the surf .",54
"on the morning of the 24th , in latitude 12 degrees 5 ' south and longitude 94 degrees 33 ' , we raised keeling island , a madreporic upheaving planted with magnificent coconut trees , which had been visited by mr . darwin and captain fitzroy . the nautilus cruised along a short distance off the shore of this desert island . our dragnets brought up many specimens of polyps and echinoderms plus some unusual shells from the branch mollusca . captain nemo 's treasures were enhanced by some valuable exhibits from the delphinula snail species , to which i joined some pointed star coral , a sort of parasitic polypary that often attaches itself to seashells .",75
