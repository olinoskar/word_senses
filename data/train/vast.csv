""" yes , professor , the sea supplies all my needs . sometimes i cast my nets in our wake , and i pull them up ready to burst . sometimes i go hunting right in the midst of this element that has long seemed so far out of man 's reach , and i corner the game that dwells in my underwater forests . like the flocks of old proteus , king neptune 's shepherd , my herds graze without fear on the ocean 's immense prairies . there i own vast properties that i harvest myself , and which are forever sown by the hand of the creator of all things .

"to judge by the distant appearance of the summit of snæfell , it would have seemed too steep to ascend on our side . fortunately , after an hour of fatigue and athletic exercises , in the midst of the vast surface of snow presented by the hollow between the two peaks , a kind of staircase appeared unexpectedly which greatly facilitated our ascent . it was formed by one of those torrents of stones flung up by the eruptions , called ' sting ' by the icelanders . if this torrent had not been arrested in its fall by the formation of the sides of the mountain , it would have gone on to the sea and formed more islands .",40,"('vast', 'vaste', 'vasto')",0

"those piles of stones just mentioned were laid out on the ocean floor with a distinct but inexplicable symmetry . i spotted gigantic furrows trailing off into the distant darkness , their length incalculable . there also were other peculiarities i could n't make sense of . it seemed to me that my heavy lead soles were crushing a litter of bones that made a dry crackling noise . so what were these vast plains we were now crossing ? i wanted to ask the captain , but i still did n't grasp that sign language that allowed him to chat with his companions when they went with him on his underwater excursions .",73,"('vast', 'vaste', 'vasto')",0
