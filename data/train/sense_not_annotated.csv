no ; it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses . the horrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it . suddenly there had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck that makes men mad . the picture had not changed . it was folly to think so .,11
"yet it was watching him , with its beautiful marred face and its cruel smile . its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight . its blue eyes met his own . a sense of infinite pity , not for himself , but for the painted image of himself , came over him . it had altered already , and would alter more . its gold would wither into grey . its red and white roses would die . for every sin that he committed , a stain would fleck and wreck its fairness . but he would not sin . the picture , changed or unchanged , would be to him the visible emblem of conscience . he would resist temptation . he would not see lord henry any more -- would not , at any rate , listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in basil hallward 's garden had first stirred within him the passion for impossible things . he would go back to sibyl vane , make her amends , marry her , try to love her again . yes , it was his duty to do so . she must have suffered more than he had . poor child ! he had been selfish and cruel to her . the fascination that she had exercised over him would return . they would be happy together . his life with her would be beautiful and pure .",33

"one thing , however , he felt that it had done for him . it had made him conscious how unjust , how cruel , he had been to sibyl vane . it was not too late to make reparation for that . she could still be his wife . his unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence , would be transformed into some nobler passion , and the portrait that basil hallward had painted of him would be a guide to him through life , would be to him what holiness is to some , and conscience to others , and the fear of god to us all . there were opiates for remorse , drugs that could lull the moral sense to sleep . but here was a visible symbol of the degradation of sin . here was an ever - present sign of the ruin men brought upon their souls .",125
