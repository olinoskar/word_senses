"this most curious island has evidently been projected from the bottom of the sea at a comparatively recent date . possibly , it may still be subject to gradual elevation . if this is the case , its origin may well be attributed to subterranean fires . therefore , in this case , the theory of sir humphry davy , saknussemm 's document , and my uncle 's theories would all go off in smoke . this hypothesis led me to examine with more attention the appearance of the surface , and i soon arrived at a conclusion as to the nature of the forces which presided at its birth .",45

"malaysians , who do a booming business in these birds with the chinese , have various methods for catching them that we could n't use . sometimes they set snares on the tops of the tall trees that the bird of paradise prefers to inhabit . at other times they capture it with a tenacious glue that paralyzes its movements . they will even go so far as to poison the springs where these fowl habitually drink . but in our case , all we could do was fire at them on the wing , which left us little chance of getting one . and in truth , we used up a good part of our ammunition in vain .",88

"for several hours the nautilus drifted in this brilliant tide , and our wonderment grew when we saw huge marine animals cavorting in it , like the fire - dwelling salamanders of myth . in the midst of these flames that did n't burn , i could see swift , elegant porpoises , the tireless pranksters of the seas , and sailfish three meters long , those shrewd heralds of hurricanes , whose fearsome broadswords sometimes banged against the lounge window . then smaller fish appeared : miscellaneous triggerfish , leather jacks , unicornfish , and a hundred others that left stripes on this luminous atmosphere in their course .",27

"as we approach nearer the dimensions of the liquid column become magnificent . the islet resembles , with a most deceiving likeness , an enormous cetacean , whose head dominates the waves at a height of twenty yards . the geyser , a word meaning ' fury , ' rises majestically from its extremity . deep and heavy explosions are heard from time to time , when the enormous jet , possessed with more furious violence , shakes its plumy crest , and springs with a bound till it reaches the lowest stratum of the clouds . it stands alone . no steam vents , no hot springs surround it , and all the volcanic power of the region is concentrated here . sparks of electric fire mingle with the dazzling sheaf of lighted fluid , every drop of which refracts the prismatic colours .",126

"when this was done , and all safe upon deck , the captain ordered the mate , with three men , to break into the round - house , where the new rebel captain lay , who , having taken the alarm , had got up , and with two men and a boy had got firearms in their hands ; and when the mate , with a crow , split open the door , the new captain and his men fired boldly among them , and wounded the mate with a musket ball , which broke his arm , and wounded two more of the men , but killed nobody . the mate , calling for help , rushed , however , into the round - house , wounded as he was , and , with his pistol , shot the new captain through the head , the bullet entering at his mouth , and came out again behind one of his ears , so that he never spoke a word more : upon which the rest yielded , and the ship was taken effectually , without any more lives lost .",81
