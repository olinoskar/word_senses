"our breakfast - table was cleared early , and holmes waited in his dressing - gown for the promised interview . our clients were punctual to their appointment , for the clock had just struck ten when dr . mortimer was shown up , followed by the young baronet . the latter was a small , alert , dark - eyed man about thirty years of age , very sturdily built , with thick black eyebrows and a strong , pugnacious face . he wore a ruddy - tinted tweed suit and had the weather - beaten appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air , and yet there was something in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated the gentleman .",1
"now , you know nothing is more disagreeable than being disturbed when one is at breakfast . we request you , then , if you really have business here , to wait till we have finished or repast , or to come again a short time hence , unless ; unless , which would be far better , you form the salutary resolution to quit the side of the rebels , and come and drink with us to the health of the king of france .

"breakfast over , i made my way ashore . the nautilus had gone a few more miles during the night . it lay well out , a good league from the coast , which was crowned by a sharp peak 400 to 500 meters high . in addition to me , the skiff carried captain nemo , two crewmen , and the instruments -- in other words , a chronometer , a spyglass , and a barometer .",0
"as soon as he was dressed , he went into the library and sat down to a light french breakfast that had been laid out for him on a small round table close to the open window . it was an exquisite day . the warm air seemed laden with spices . a bee flew in and buzzed round the blue - dragon bowl that , filled with sulphur - yellow roses , stood before him . he felt perfectly happy .",19
here a halt was made for breakfast under the shade of some splendid trees .,6
"besides , there were fewer to feed ; the sick could eat little ; our breakfast - basins were better filled ; when there was no time to prepare a regular dinner , which often happened , she would give us a large piece of cold pie , or a thick slice of bread and cheese , and this we carried away with us to the wood , where we each chose the spot we liked best , and dined sumptuously .",15

"the worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat as hearty a breakfast as possible before leaving the carnatic ; but , as he had been walking about all day , the demands of hunger were becoming importunate . he observed that the butchers stalls contained neither mutton , goat , nor pork ; and , knowing also that it is a sacrilege to kill cattle , which are preserved solely for farming , he made up his mind that meat was far from plentiful in yokohama -- nor was he mistaken ; and , in default of butcher 's meat , he could have wished for a quarter of wild boar or deer , a partridge , or some quails , some game or fish , which , with rice , the japanese eat almost exclusively . but he found it necessary to keep up a stout heart , and to postpone the meal he craved till the following morning . night came , and passepartout re - entered the native quarter , where he wandered through the streets , lit by vari - coloured lanterns , looking on at the dancers , who were executing skilful steps and boundings , and the astrologers who stood in the open air with their telescopes . then he came to the harbour , which was lit up by the resin torches of the fishermen , who were fishing from their boats .",13

"but the morning passed just as usual : nothing happened to interrupt the quiet course of adele 's studies ; only soon after breakfast , i heard some bustle in the neighbourhood of mr . rochester 's chamber , mrs . fairfax 's voice , and leah 's , and the cook's -- that is , john 's wife -- and even john 's own gruff tones .",23

"the fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface from our minds the grim and gray impression which had been left upon both of us by our first experience of baskerville hall . as sir henry and i sat at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through the high mullioned windows , throwing watery patches of colour from the coats of arms which covered them . the dark panelling glowed like bronze in the golden rays , and it was hard to realize that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such a gloom into our souls upon the evening before .",42

"from the 14th of august to the 26th , incessant rain , so that i could not stir , and was now very careful not to be much wet . in this confinement , i began to be straitened for food : but venturing out twice , i one day killed a goat ; and the last day , which was the 26th , found a very large tortoise , which was a treat to me , and my food was regulated thus : i ate a bunch of raisins for my breakfast ; a piece of the goat â€™s flesh , or of the turtle , for my dinner , broiled â€” for , to my great misfortune , i had no vessel to boil or stew anything ; and two or three of the turtle â€™s eggs for my supper .",92

"it was upon the 4th of march , as i have good reason to remember , that i rose somewhat earlier than usual , and found that sherlock holmes had not yet finished his breakfast . the landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared . with the unreasonable petulance of mankind i rang the bell and gave a curt intimation that i was ready . then i picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it , while my companion munched silently at his toast . one of the articles had a pencil mark at the heading , and i naturally began to run my eye through it .",34
