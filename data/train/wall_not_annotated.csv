"leaning against the walls , i dragged myself down the gangways to the lounge , whose ceiling lights were on . the furniture had been knocked over . fortunately the glass cases were solidly secured at the base and had stood fast . since we were no longer vertical , the starboard pictures were glued to the tapestries , while those to port had their lower edges hanging a foot away from the wall . so the nautilus was lying on its starboard side , completely stationary to boot .",3

"he was about to see in reality a certain coffer of which he had twenty times beheld the image in his dreams -- a coffer long and deep , locked , bolted , fastened in the wall ; a coffer of which he had so often heard , and which the hands -- a little wrinkled , it is true , but still not without elegance -- of the procurator ’s wife were about to open to his admiring looks .",36

"in fact , there beneath my eyes was a town in ruins , demolished , overwhelmed , laid low , its roofs caved in , its temples pulled down , its arches dislocated , its columns stretching over the earth ; in these ruins you could still detect the solid proportions of a sort of tuscan architecture ; farther off , the remains of a gigantic aqueduct ; here , the caked heights of an acropolis along with the fluid forms of a parthenon ; there , the remnants of a wharf , as if some bygone port had long ago harbored merchant vessels and triple - tiered war galleys on the shores of some lost ocean ; still farther off , long rows of collapsing walls , deserted thoroughfares , a whole pompeii buried under the waters , which captain nemo had resurrected before my eyes !",126

"one day solon was conversing with some elderly wise men in the egyptian capital of sais , a town already 8,000 years of age , as documented by the annals engraved on the sacred walls of its temples . one of these elders related the history of another town 1,000 years older still . this original city of athens , ninety centuries old , had been invaded and partly destroyed by the atlanteans . these atlanteans , he said , resided on an immense continent greater than africa and asia combined , taking in an area that lay between latitude 12 degrees and 40 degrees north . their dominion extended even to egypt . they tried to enforce their rule as far as greece , but they had to retreat before the indomitable resistance of the hellenic people . centuries passed . a cataclysm occurred -- floods , earthquakes . a single night and day were enough to obliterate this atlantis , whose highest peaks ( madeira , the azores , the canaries , the cape verde islands ) still emerge above the waves .",34
"i looked upon the scene before me — upon the mere house , and the simple landscape features of the domain — upon the bleak walls — upon the vacant eye - like windows — upon a few rank sedges — and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees — with an utter depression of soul which i can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after - dream of the reveller upon opium — the bitter lapse into every - day life — the hideous dropping off of the veil .",25

"placed where he was , d’artagnan could not perceive the face of aramis . we say aramis , because the young man entertained no doubt that it was his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of the exterior . curiosity prevailed over prudence ; and profiting by the preoccupation into which the sight of the handkerchief appeared to have plunged the two personages now on the scene , he stole from his hiding place , and quick as lightning , but stepping with utmost caution , he ran and placed himself close to the angle of the wall , from which his eye could pierce the interior of aramis ’s room .",102
"i had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity — an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven , but which had reeked up from the decayed trees , and the gray wall , and the silent tarn — a pestilent and mystic vapor , dull , sluggish , faintly discernible , and leaden - hued .",55

"during the night , in line with my forecasts , a new one - meter slice was removed from this immense socket . but in the morning , wearing my diving suit , i was crossing through the liquid mass in a temperature of -6 degrees to -7 degrees centigrade , when i noted that little by little the side walls were closing in on each other . the liquid strata farthest from the trench , not warmed by the movements of workmen and tools , were showing a tendency to solidify . in the face of this imminent new danger , what would happen to our chances for salvation , and how could we prevent this liquid medium from solidifying , then cracking the nautilus 's hull like glass ?",60
"this stream of electricity dazzled my eyes , and after momentarily shutting them , i looked around . the nautilus was stationary . it was floating next to an embankment shaped like a wharf . as for the water now buoying the ship , it was a lake completely encircled by an inner wall about two miles in diameter , hence six miles around . its level -- as indicated by the pressure gauge -- would be the same as the outside level , because some connection had to exist between this lake and the sea . slanting inward over their base , these high walls converged to form a vault shaped like an immense upside - down funnel that measured 500 or 600 meters in height . at its summit there gaped the circular opening through which i had detected that faint glimmer , obviously daylight .",53

"he had not entered the place for more than four years -- not , indeed , since he had used it first as a play- room when he was a child , and then as a study when he grew somewhat older . it was a large , well- proportioned room , which had been specially built by the last lord kelso for the use of the little grandson whom , for his strange likeness to his mother , and also for other reasons , he had always hated and desired to keep at a distance . it appeared to dorian to have but little changed . there was the huge italian cassone , with its fantastically painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings , in which he had so often hidden himself as a boy . there the satinwood book - case filled with his dog - eared schoolbooks . on the wall behind it was hanging the same ragged flemish tapestry where a faded king and queen were playing chess in a garden , while a company of hawkers rode by , carrying hooded birds on their gauntleted wrists . how well he remembered it all ! every moment of his lonely childhood came back to him as he looked round . he recalled the stainless purity of his boyish life , and it seemed horrible to him that it was here the fatal portrait was to be hidden away . how little he had thought , in those dead days , of all that was in store for him !",153
"but when we had ascended to an elevation of about 250 feet , we were stopped by insurmountable obstacles . the converging inside walls changed into overhangs , and our climb into a circular stroll . at this topmost level the vegetable kingdom began to challenge the mineral kingdom . shrubs , and even a few trees , emerged from crevices in the walls . i recognized some spurges that let their caustic , purgative sap trickle out . there were heliotropes , very remiss at living up to their sun - worshipping reputations since no sunlight ever reached them ; their clusters of flowers drooped sadly , their colors and scents were faded . here and there chrysanthemums sprouted timidly at the feet of aloes with long , sad , sickly leaves . but between these lava flows i spotted little violets that still gave off a subtle fragrance , and i confess that i inhaled it with delight . the soul of a flower is its scent , and those splendid water plants , flowers of the sea , have no souls !",23

"thus day followed day ; and as sure as morning came he found that his unseen enemies had kept their register , and had marked up in some conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the month of grace . sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls , sometimes upon the floors , occasionally they were on small placards stuck upon the garden gate or the railings . with all his vigilance john ferrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded . a horror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of them . he became haggard and restless , and his eyes had the troubled look of some hunted creature . he had but one hope in life now , and that was for the arrival of the young hunter from nevada .",52
