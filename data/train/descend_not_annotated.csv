"during the night of february 16 - 17 , we entered the second mediterranean basin , whose maximum depth we found at 3,000 meters . the nautilus , driven downward by its propeller and slanting fins , descended to the lowest strata of this sea .",37
""" professor , "" captain nemo then told me , "" there are pearl fisheries in the bay of bengal , the seas of the east indies , the seas of china and japan , plus those seas south of the united states , the gulf of panama and the gulf of california ; but it 's off ceylon that such fishing reaps its richest rewards . no doubt we 'll be arriving a little early . fishermen gather in the gulf of mannar only during the month of march , and for thirty days some 300 boats concentrate on the lucrative harvest of these treasures from the sea . each boat is manned by ten oarsmen and ten fishermen . the latter divide into two groups , dive in rotation , and descend to a depth of twelve meters with the help of a heavy stone clutched between their feet and attached by a rope to their boat .

"on this occasion pencroft and his companions , who were occupied with loosing themselves , received unexpected aid from the prisoner , who emerged from the hatchway as if his sailor 's instinct had suddenly returned , broke a piece out of the bulwarks with a spar so as to let the water which filled the deck escape . then the vessel being clear , he descended to his cabin without having uttered a word .",66
""" thank you , "" returned mr . fogg , descending mathematically to the saloon .",10
"the officer desired to have milady ’s packages pointed out to him , and ordered them to be placed in the boat . when this operation was complete , he invited her to descend by offering her his hand .",33
"then i began to lose my head . i arose with my arms stretched out before me , attempting painfully to feel my way . i began to run wildly , hurrying through the inextricable maze , still descending , still running through the substance of the earth 's thick crust , a struggling denizen of geological ' faults , ' crying , shouting , yelling , soon bruised by contact with the jagged rock , falling and rising again bleeding , trying to drink the blood which covered my face , and even waiting for some rock to shatter my skull against .",38
"an enormous mass was sinking beneath the waters , and the nautilus , missing none of its death throes , was descending into the depths with it . ten meters away , i could see its gaping hull , into which water was rushing with a sound of thunder , then its double rows of cannons and railings . its deck was covered with dark , quivering shadows .",21

"the storm of rain and wind descended upon them towards eight o'clock . with but its bit of sail , the tankadere was lifted like a feather by a wind , an idea of whose violence can scarcely be given . to compare her speed to four times that of a locomotive going on full steam would be below the truth .",6

"as fast as we descended , the succession of beds forming the primitive foundation came out with increasing distinctness . geologists consider this primitive matter to be the base of the mineral crust of the earth , and have ascertained it to be composed of three different formations , schist , gneiss , and mica schist , resting upon that unchangeable foundation , the granite .",4
"at sunrise the next morning , february 12 , the nautilus rose to the surface of the waves . i rushed onto the platform . the hazy silhouette of pelusium was outlined three miles to the south . a torrent had carried us from one sea to the other . but although that tunnel was easy to descend , going back up must have been impossible .",57
