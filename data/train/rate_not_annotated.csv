"from january 21 to the 23rd , the nautilus traveled at the rate of 250 leagues in twenty - four hours , hence 540 miles at twenty - two miles per hour . if , during our trip , we were able to identify these different varieties of fish , it 's because they were attracted by our electric light and tried to follow alongside ; but most of them were outdistanced by our speed and soon fell behind ; temporarily , however , a few managed to keep pace in the nautilus 's waters .",12
