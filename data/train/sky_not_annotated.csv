"near midnight the sea suddenly resumed its usual hue , but behind us all the way to the horizon , the skies kept mirroring the whiteness of those waves and for a good while seemed imbued with the hazy glow of an aurora borealis .",21
"we had started under a sky overcast but calm . there was no fear of heat , none of disastrous rain . it was just the weather for tourists .",5
"there , in place of natural wonders , the watery mass offered some thrilling and dreadful scenes to my eyes . in essence , we were then crossing that part of the whole mediterranean so fertile in casualties . from the coast of algiers to the beaches of provence , how many ships have wrecked , how many vessels have vanished ! compared to the vast liquid plains of the pacific , the mediterranean is a mere lake , but it 's an unpredictable lake with fickle waves , today kindly and affectionate to those frail single - masters drifting between a double ultramarine of sky and water , tomorrow bad - tempered and turbulent , agitated by the winds , demolishing the strongest ships beneath sudden waves that smash down with a headlong wallop .",105
"some heavy clouds , swept from the sky by a rising wind , had left the moon bare ; and her light , streaming in through a window near , shone full both on us and on the approaching figure , which we at once recognised as miss temple .",7
"we had no time to watch these phenomena ; we had to proceed on our way . soon at the foot of the mountains the boggy land reappeared , intersected by little lakes . our route now lay westward ; we had turned the great bay of faxa , and the twin peaks of sn√¶fell rose white into the cloudy sky at the distance of at least five miles .",60
"i skirted fields , and hedges , and lanes till after sunrise . i believe it was a lovely summer morning : i know my shoes , which i had put on when i left the house , were soon wet with dew . but i looked neither to rising sun , nor smiling sky , nor wakening nature .",54
"he saw me ; for the moon had opened a blue field in the sky , and rode in it watery bright : he took his hat off , and waved it round his head . i now ran to meet him .",14
"at this thought , i turned my face aside from the lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of morton -- i say _ lonely _ , for in that bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the church and the parsonage , half - hid in trees , and , quite at the extremity , the roof of vale hall , where the rich mr . oliver and his daughter lived .",12
"perfect beauty is a strong expression ; but i do not retrace or qualify it : as sweet features as ever the temperate clime of albion moulded ; as pure hues of rose and lily as ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened , justified , in this instance , the term .",42
"the next morning , a grey , heavy , cloudy sky seemed to droop over the summit of the cone . i did not know this first from the appearances of nature , but i found it out by my uncle 's impetuous wrath .",10
"yesterday i trusted well in providence , and believed that events were working together for your good and mine : it was a fine day , if you recollect -- the calmness of the air and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on your journey .",36
"if the grotto of guachara , in colombia , visited by humboldt , had not given up the whole of the secret of its depth to the philosopher , who investigated it to the depth of 2,500 feet , it probably did not extend much farther . the immense mammoth cave in kentucky is of gigantic proportions , since its vaulted roof rises five hundred feet [ 1 ] above the level of an unfathomable lake and travellers have explored its ramifications to the extent of forty miles . but what were these cavities compared to that in which i stood with wonder and admiration , with its sky of luminous vapours , its bursts of electric light , and a vast sea filling its bed ? my imagination fell powerless before such immensity .",108
""" in order to steer this boat to port or starboard , in short , to make turns on a horizontal plane , i use an ordinary , wide - bladed rudder that 's fastened to the rear of the sternpost and worked by a wheel and tackle . but i can also move the nautilus upward and downward on a vertical plane by the simple method of slanting its two fins , which are attached to its sides at its center of flotation ; these fins are flexible , able to assume any position , and can be operated from inside by means of powerful levers . if these fins stay parallel with the boat , the latter moves horizontally . if they slant , the nautilus follows the angle of that slant and , under its propeller 's thrust , either sinks on a diagonal as steep as it suits me , or rises on that diagonal . and similarly , if i want to return more swiftly to the surface , i throw the propeller in gear , and the water 's pressure makes the nautilus rise vertically , as an air balloon inflated with hydrogen lifts swiftly into the skies . """,203
""" i think that we shall be obliged to do so , whether we like it or not , "" answered pencroft , "" for the sky looks very threatening towards the west .",26
like a tea - tray in the sky .,7
"how different it was with material things ! where had they passed to ? where was the great crocus - coloured robe , on which the gods fought against the giants , that had been worked by brown girls for the pleasure of athena ? where the huge velarium that nero had stretched across the colosseum at rome , that titan sail of purple on which was represented the starry sky , and apollo driving a chariot drawn by white , gilt - reined steeds ? he longed to see the curious table - napkins wrought for the priest of the sun , on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast ; the mortuary cloth of king chilperic , with its three hundred golden bees ; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the bishop of pontus and were figured with "" lions , panthers , bears , dogs , forests , rocks , hunters -- all , in fact , that a painter can copy from nature "" ; and the coat that charles of orleans once wore , on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning "" madame , je suis tout joyeux , "" the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread , and each note , of square shape in those days , formed with four pearls .",70
""" stones do n't fall from the sky , "" conseil said , "" or else they deserve to be called meteorites . """,7
"again i looked out : we were passing a church ; i saw its low broad tower against the sky , and its bell was tolling a quarter ; i saw a narrow galaxy of lights too , on a hillside , marking a village or hamlet .",19
""" yes , you are the same . i wonder what the rest of your life will be . do n't spoil it by renunciations . at present you are a perfect type . do n't make yourself incomplete . you are quite flawless now . you need not shake your head : you know you are . besides , dorian , do n't deceive yourself . life is not governed by will or intention . life is a question of nerves , and fibres , and slowly built - up cells in which thought hides itself and passion has its dreams . you may fancy yourself safe and think yourself strong . but a chance tone of colour in a room or a morning sky , a particular perfume that you had once loved and that brings subtle memories with it , a line from a forgotten poem that you had come across again , a cadence from a piece of music that you had ceased to play-- i tell you , dorian , that it is on things like these that our lives depend . browning writes about that somewhere ; but our own senses will imagine them for us .",125
"but , if he thought of these possibilities , he did not betray the fact by any outward sign . always the same impassible member of the reform club , whom no incident could surprise , as unvarying as the ship 's chronometers , and seldom having the curiosity even to go upon the deck , he passed through the memorable scenes of the red sea with cold indifference ; did not care to recognise the historic towns and villages which , along its borders , raised their picturesque outlines against the sky ; and betrayed no fear of the dangers of the arabic gulf , which the old historians always spoke of with horror , and upon which the ancient navigators never ventured without propitiating the gods by ample sacrifices . how did this eccentric personage pass his time on the mongolia ? he made his four hearty meals every day , regardless of the most persistent rolling and pitching on the part of the steamer ; and he played whist indefatigably , for he had found partners as enthusiastic in the game as himself .",92
"but soon these last representatives of animal life vanished , and three vertical leagues down , the nautilus passed below the limits of underwater existence just as an air balloon rises above the breathable zones in the sky . we reached a depth of 16,000 meters-- four vertical leagues -- and by then the nautilus 's plating was tolerating a pressure of 1,600 atmospheres , in other words , 1,600 kilograms per each square centimeter on its surface !",37
"just then its peak appeared before us , standing out distinctly against the background of the skies . this forecast fair weather . and so it proved .",16
"its fins set vertically , its propeller thrown in gear at the captain 's signal , the nautilus rose with lightning speed , shooting upward like an air balloon into the sky . vibrating resonantly , it knifed through the watery mass . not a single detail was visible . in four minutes it had cleared the four vertical leagues separating it from the surface of the ocean , and after emerging like a flying fish , it fell back into the sea , making the waves leap to prodigious heights .",31
"the trip was being accomplished most successfully , and passepartout was enchanted with the congenial companion which chance had secured him in the person of the delightful fix . on sunday , october 20th , towards noon , they came in sight of the indian coast : two hours later the pilot came on board . a range of hills lay against the sky in the horizon , and soon the rows of palms which adorn bombay came distinctly into view . the steamer entered the road formed by the islands in the bay , and at half - past four she hauled up at the quays of bombay .",63
candide praised the music to the skies .,6
"the heavy coils of smoke from the _ ellenora 's _ funnel unrolled in the sky , the bridge shook with the quivering of the struggling steam ; we were on board , and owners for the time of two berths , one over the other , in the only saloon cabin on board .",15
"after crossing a few narrow streets where some convicts , in trousers half yellow and half grey , were at work under the orders of the gangers , we arrived at the vor frelsers kirk . there was nothing remarkable about the church ; but there was a reason why its tall spire had attracted the professor 's attention . starting from the top of the tower , an external staircase wound around the spire , the spirals circling up into the sky .",82
"just then the chief officer drew the captain 's attention anew . the latter interrupted his strolling and aimed his spyglass at the point indicated . he observed it a good while . as for me , deeply puzzled , i went below to the lounge and brought back an excellent long - range telescope i habitually used . leaning my elbows on the beacon housing , which jutted from the stern of the platform , i got set to scour that whole stretch of sky and sea . but no sooner had i peered into the eyepiece than the instrument was snatched from my hands .",85
"in the sky toward the southern horizon , there stretched a dazzling white band . english whalers have given this the name "" ice blink . "" no matter how heavy the clouds may be , they ca n't obscure this phenomenon . it announces the presence of a pack , or shoal , of ice .",2
"he can not now see very distinctly : he can not read or write much ; but he can find his way without being led by the hand : the sky is no longer a blank to him -- the earth no longer a void . when his first - born was put into his arms , he could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes , as they once were -- large , brilliant , and black .",30
how soft and perfumed was the air ; how lovely the blue heavens and star - enameled sky !,17
"she was a big woman , and had long black hair : we could see it streaming against the flames as she stood . i witnessed , and several more witnessed , mr . rochester ascend through the sky - light on to the roof ; we heard him call ' bertha ! '",38
"meanwhile preparations for this daring attempt were getting under way . the nautilus 's powerful pumps forced air down into the tanks and stored it under high pressure . near four o'clock captain nemo informed me that the platform hatches were about to be closed . i took a last look at the dense ice bank we were going to conquer . the weather was fair , the skies reasonably clear , the cold quite brisk , namely -12 degrees centigrade ; but after the wind had lulled , this temperature did n't seem too unbearable .",68
"the panorama of the islands , as they steamed by them , was superb . vast forests of palms , arecs , bamboo , teakwood , of the gigantic mimosa , and tree - like ferns covered the foreground , while behind , the graceful outlines of the mountains were traced against the sky ; and along the coasts swarmed by thousands the precious swallows whose nests furnish a luxurious dish to the tables of the celestial empire . the varied landscape afforded by the andaman islands was soon passed , however , and the rangoon rapidly approached the straits of malacca , which gave access to the china seas .",53
