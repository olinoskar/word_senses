"half an hour later , guided by its electric trail , we reached the nautilus . the outside door had been left open , and captain nemo closed it after we reentered the first cell . then he pressed a button . i heard pumps operating within the ship , i felt the water lowering around me , and in a few moments the cell was completely empty . the inside door opened , and we passed into the wardrobe .",70
not a sound could be heard inside the palisade .,6
"among the fish that the nautilus startled on its way , i 'll mention a one - meter lumpfish , blackish on top with orange on the belly and rare among its brethren in that it practices monogamy , a good - sized eelpout , a type of emerald moray whose flavor is excellent , wolffish with big eyes in a head somewhat resembling a canine 's , viviparous blennies whose eggs hatch inside their bodies like those of snakes , bloated gobio ( or black gudgeon ) measuring two decimeters , grenadiers with long tails and gleaming with a silvery glow , speedy fish venturing far from their high arctic seas .",73
"they extricated from among a large number of shot twenty barrels , the insides of which were lined with copper .",13
"by then it was eight o'clock . the air inside the nautilus should have been renewed four hours earlier , following daily practice on board . but i did n't suffer very much , although captain nemo had n't yet made demands on the supplementary oxygen in his air tanks .",9
"this , if the smoke did not take the heat out with it , would be enough to maintain an equal temperature inside .",22
"the engineer , the reporter , herbert , and pencroft , proceeded to the door , in order to ascertain if it was barricaded inside .",24
"the nautilus 's nets hauled up several types of sea turtle from the hawksbill genus with arching backs whose scales are highly prized . diving easily , these reptiles can remain a good while underwater by closing the fleshy valves located at the external openings of their nasal passages . when they were captured , some hawksbills were still asleep inside their carapaces , a refuge from other marine animals . the flesh of these turtles was nothing memorable , but their eggs made an excellent feast .",60
"inside the mediterranean , then , i could catch no more of its fast - passing scenery than a traveler might see from an express train ; in other words , i could view only the distant horizons because the foregrounds flashed by like lightning . but conseil and i were able to observe those mediterranean fish whose powerful fins kept pace for a while in the nautilus 's waters . we stayed on watch before the lounge windows , and our notes enable me to reconstruct , in a few words , the ichthyology of this sea .",0
