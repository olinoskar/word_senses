"i 'll mention chiefly some trunkfish unique to the red sea , the sea of the east indies , and that part of the ocean washing the coasts of equinoctial america . like turtles , armadillos , sea urchins , and crustaceans , these fish are protected by armor plate that 's neither chalky nor stony but actual bone . sometimes this armor takes the shape of a solid triangle , sometimes that of a solid quadrangle . among the triangular type , i noticed some half a decimeter long , with brown tails , yellow fins , and wholesome , exquisitely tasty flesh ; i even recommend that they be acclimatized to fresh water , a change , incidentally , that a number of saltwater fish can make with ease . i 'll also mention some quadrangular trunkfish topped by four large protuberances along the back ; trunkfish sprinkled with white spots on the underside of the body , which make good house pets like certain birds ; boxfish armed with stings formed by extensions of their bony crusts , and whose odd grunting has earned them the nickname "" sea pigs "" ; then some trunkfish known as dromedaries , with tough , leathery flesh and big conical humps .",113
"i confess that i was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the practical nature of my companion 's theories . my respect for his powers of analysis increased wondrously . there still remained some lurking suspicion in my mind , however , that the whole thing was a pre - arranged episode , intended to dazzle me , though what earthly object he could have in taking me in was past my comprehension . when i looked at him he had finished reading the note , and his eyes had assumed the vacant , lack - lustre expression which showed mental abstraction .",9
"in the midst of the watery mass , brightly lit by our electric beams , there snaked past those one - meter lampreys that are common to nearly every clime . a type of ray from the genus oxyrhynchus , five feet wide , had a white belly with a spotted , ash - gray back and was carried along by the currents like a huge , wide - open shawl . other rays passed by so quickly i could n't tell if they deserved that name "" eagle ray "" coined by the ancient greeks , or those designations of "" rat ray , "" "" bat ray , "" and "" toad ray "" that modern fishermen have inflicted on them . dogfish known as topes , twelve feet long and especially feared by divers , were racing with each other . looking like big bluish shadows , thresher sharks went by , eight feet long and gifted with an extremely acute sense of smell . dorados from the genus sparus , some measuring up to thirteen decimeters , appeared in silver and azure costumes encircled with ribbons , which contrasted with the dark color of their fins ; fish sacred to the goddess venus , their eyes set in brows of gold ; a valuable species that patronizes all waters fresh or salt , equally at home in rivers , lakes , and oceans , living in every clime , tolerating any temperature , their line dating back to prehistoric times on this earth yet preserving all its beauty from those far - off days . magnificent sturgeons , nine to ten meters long and extremely fast , banged their powerful tails against the glass of our panels , showing bluish backs with small brown spots ; they resemble sharks , without equaling their strength , and are encountered in every sea ; in the spring they delight in swimming up the great rivers , fighting the currents of the volga , danube , po , rhine , loire , and oder , while feeding on herring , mackerel , salmon , and codfish ; although they belong to the class of cartilaginous fish , they rate as a delicacy ; they 're eaten fresh , dried , marinated , or salt - preserved , and in olden times they were borne in triumph to the table of the roman epicure lucullus . but whenever the nautilus drew near the surface , those denizens of the mediterranean i could observe most productively belonged to the sixty - third genus of bony fish . these were tuna from the genus scomber , blue - black on top , silver on the belly armor , their dorsal stripes giving off a golden gleam . they are said to follow ships in search of refreshing shade from the hot tropical sun , and they did just that with the nautilus , as they had once done with the vessels of the count de la pérouse . for long hours they competed in speed with our submersible . i could n't stop marveling at these animals so perfectly cut out for racing , their heads small , their bodies sleek , spindle - shaped , and in some cases over three meters long , their pectoral fins gifted with remarkable strength , their caudal fins forked . like certain flocks of birds , whose speed they equal , these tuna swim in triangle formation , which prompted the ancients to say they 'd boned up on geometry and military strategy . and yet they ca n't escape the provençal fishermen , who prize them as highly as did the ancient inhabitants of turkey and italy ; and these valuable animals , as oblivious as if they were deaf and blind , leap right into the marseilles tuna nets and perish by the thousands .",223
