at six o'clock our preparations were over . m. fridrikssen shook hands with us . my uncle thanked him heartily for his extreme kindness . i constructed a few fine latin sentences to express my cordial farewell . then we bestrode our steeds and with his last adieu m. fridrikssen treated me to a line of virgil eminently applicable to such uncertain wanderers as we were likely to be :,33
"this expression rather disturbed fix , without his knowing why . had the frenchman guessed his real purpose ? he knew not what to think . but how could passepartout have discovered that he was a detective ? yet , in speaking as he did , the man evidently meant more than he expressed .",53
"adele , when lifted in , commenced kissing me , by way of expressing her gratitude for my intercession : she was instantly stowed away into a corner on the other side of him .",13
""" permit me , madame , to express my surprise , "" said the abbess .",7
"when the young guardsman and the three musketeers were without witnesses , they looked at one another with an air which plainly expressed that each of them perceived the gravity of their situation .",22
""" then let us go and look at the room . "" with which inconsequent remark he strode on into the house , followed by gregson , whose features expressed his astonishment .",29
"they were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms ; with the new drapery , and fresh carpets , and rich tinted china vases : they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly .",28
the conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his succeeding observations .,8
"their companions had drawn near , and the gratitude with which their hearts were charged was about to express itself in their gestures and words . captain nemo stopped them by a sign , and in a voice which betrayed more emotion than he doubtless intended to show .",18
"by dint of entreaties expressed in energetic whispers , i reduced the half - dozen to two : these however , he vowed he would select himself .",4
"at the entrance was a portal two hundred and twenty feet high and one hundred wide ; but it is impossible for words to express the materials of which it was built . the reader , however , will readily conceive that they must have a prodigious superiority over the pebbles and sand , which we call gold and precious stones .",24
""" in essence , the narwhale is armed with a sort of ivory sword , or lance , as certain naturalists have expressed it . it 's a king - sized tooth as hard as steel . some of these teeth have been found buried in the bodies of baleen whales , which the narwhale attacks with invariable success . others have been wrenched , not without difficulty , from the undersides of vessels that narwhales have pierced clean through , as a gimlet pierces a wine barrel . the museum at the faculty of medicine in paris owns one of these tusks with a length of 2.25 meters and a width at its base of forty - eight centimeters !",22
"there mr . fogg examined a curious vehicle , a kind of frame on two long beams , a little raised in front like the runners of a sledge , and upon which there was room for five or six persons . a high mast was fixed on the frame , held firmly by metallic lashings , to which was attached a large brigantine sail . this mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist a jib - sail . behind , a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle . it was , in short , a sledge rigged like a sloop . during the winter , when the trains are blocked up by the snow , these sledges make extremely rapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another . provided with more sails than a cutter , and with the wind behind them , they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not superior to that of the express trains .",170
"from the bosom of his robe he then produced a casket , opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and earrings ; she acted astonishment and admiration ; kneeling , he laid the treasure at her feet ; incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks and gestures ; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the rings in her ears .",41
"he expressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her majesty ; he related to him what he had heard of the projects of the cardinal with regard to buckingham , and all with a tranquillity and candor of which m. de treville was the more the dupe , from having himself , as we have said , observed something fresh between the cardinal , the king , and the queen .",1
"and if master jup had not been satisfied , he would have been very difficult to please ; but he was quite contented and contemplated his own countenance with a sentimental air which expressed some small amount of conceit .",33
"my companion expressed no surprise at this emotion , nor did he question me as to its cause ; he only said--",2
"felton only expressed , with regard to the duke , the feeling of execration which all the english had declared toward him whom the catholics themselves called the extortioner , the pillager , the debauchee , and whom the puritans styled simply satan .",2
"after some time dorian gray looked up . "" you have explained me to myself , harry , "" he murmured with something of a sigh of relief . "" i felt all that you have said , but somehow i was afraid of it , and i could not express it to myself . how well you know me ! but we will not talk again of what has happened . it has been a marvellous experience . that is all . i wonder if life has still in store for me anything as marvellous . """,50
"stepping ashore had an exhilarating effect on me . ned land tested the soil with his foot , as if he were laying claim to it . yet it had been only two months since we had become , as captain nemo expressed it , "" passengers on the nautilus , "" in other words , the literal prisoners of its commander .",42
"then he explained to him the cause of his visit , and the service he required of him . but scarcely had he expressed his request when the unknown , who remained standing before the musketeer , drew back with signs of terror , and refused .",23
""" very well ; i hope you feel the content you express : at any rate , your good sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the vacillating fears of lot 's wife .",11
"this was where the nautilus had been sent accidentally-- or perhaps deliberately -- by its captain . it was sweeping around in a spiral whose radius kept growing smaller and smaller . the skiff , still attached to the ship 's plating , was likewise carried around at dizzying speed . i could feel us whirling . i was experiencing that accompanying nausea that follows such continuous spinning motions . we were in dread , in the last stages of sheer horror , our blood frozen in our veins , our nerves numb , drenched in cold sweat as if from the throes of dying ! and what a noise around our frail skiff ! what roars echoing from several miles away ! what crashes from the waters breaking against sharp rocks on the seafloor , where the hardest objects are smashed , where tree trunks are worn down and worked into "" a shaggy fur , "" as norwegians express it !",160
""" you have , then , decided to come to england again , "" said lord de winter , "" in spite of the resolutions you so often expressed in paris never to set your feet on british ground ? """,28
"at the bottom of the crater were three chimneys , through which , in its eruptions , snæfell had driven forth fire and lava from its central furnace . each of these chimneys was a hundred feet in diameter . they gaped before us right in our path . i had not the courage to look down either of them . but professor liedenbrock had hastily surveyed all three ; he was panting , running from one to the other , gesticulating , and uttering incoherent expressions . hans and his comrades , seated upon loose lava rocks , looked at him with as much wonder as they knew how to express , and perhaps taking him for an escaped lunatic .",111
""" without reckoning , monsieur , "" added planchet to his master ’s audibly expressed reflections , "" that we perhaps owe our lives to him .",14

""" right , ned , and then picture the damage such a mass could inflict if it were launched with the speed of an express train against a ship 's hull . """,24
""" yes , "" replied the abbe , "" but it is with anger in their hearts ; they express all their complaints by loud bursts of laughter , and commit the most detestable crimes with a smile on their faces . """,19
"the sailor considered the apparatus ; then he gazed at the engineer without saying a word , only a look plainly expressed his opinion that if cyrus harding was not a magician , he was certainly no ordinary man .",21
"meanwhile , the young man had darted in to his chamber , and opened the letter . it was from mme . bonacieux , and was expressed in these terms :",26
"two hours ! admitting that he was at this moment taking an express train , he could reach london and the reform club by a quarter before nine , p.m. his forehead slightly wrinkled .",12
""" i am afraid you are disappointed in me , bessie . "" i said this laughing : i perceived that bessie 's glance , though it expressed regard , did in no shape denote admiration .",27
phileas fogg asked if there was an express train about to leave for london .,7
it was forty minutes past two . the express train had left thirty - five minutes before . phileas fogg then ordered a special train .,8
"inquest on an actress.--an inquest was held this morning at the bell tavern , hoxton road , by mr . danby , the district coroner , on the body of sibyl vane , a young actress recently engaged at the royal theatre , holborn . a verdict of death by misadventure was returned . considerable sympathy was expressed for the mother of the deceased , who was greatly affected during the giving of her own evidence , and that of dr . birrell , who had made the post - mortem examination of the deceased .",57
his countenance expressed deep humility .,2
""" speak , my boy , do n't be afraid . you are quite at liberty to express your opinions . you are no longer my nephew only , but my colleague . pray go on . """,17

"i thanked her for her considerate choice , and as i really felt fatigued with my long journey , expressed my readiness to retire .",19
"i was one of the last to go out , and in passing the tables , i saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it ; she looked at the others ; all their countenances expressed displeasure , and one of them , the stout one , whispered--",39
"it appeared so , as soon he was heard to express himself in these incoherent sentences:-- "" why am i here ? ....",10
""" for you to know could not have helped us , and might possibly have led to my discovery . you would have wished to tell me something , or in your kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or other , and so an unnecessary risk would be run . i brought cartwright down with me -- you remember the little chap at the express office -- and he has seen after my simple wants : a loaf of bread and a clean collar . what does man want more ? he has given me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of feet , and both have been invaluable . """,67
"the old woman bedewed them with spirits ; they recovered - they began to speak . at first they could express themselves only in broken accents ; their questions and answers were alternately interrupted with sighs , tears , and exclamations .",20
""" there are maxims in this writer , "" replied pococurante , "" whence a man of the world may reap some benefit ; and the short measure of the verse makes them more easily to be retained in the memory . but i see nothing extraordinary in his journey to brundusium , and his account of his had dinner ; nor in his dirty , low quarrel between one rupillius , whose words , as he expresses it , were full of poisonous filth ; and another , whose language was dipped in vinegar .",77
""" nothing would be more easy , "" said the captain of a vessel ready to set sail , "" but this morning came an order to let no one leave without express permission from the cardinal . """,32
""" i must indeed , "" i said ; "" for when just now i repeated the offer of serving him for a deacon , he expressed himself shocked at my want of decency .",26
flight was out of the question now . the reptiles rose ; they wheeled around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express trains . they described around us gradually narrowing circles . i took up my rifle . but what could a ball do against the scaly armour with which these enormous beasts were clad ?,25
""" i see you just as feeble - minded as you were before , and still expressing only despair ! """,16
""" i 'm blessed but it is really a vessel ! "" he exclaimed , in a voice which did not express any great amount of satisfaction .",21
i hold myself supremely blest -- blest beyond what language can express ; because i am my husband 's life as fully as he is mine . no woman was ever nearer to her mate than i am : ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh .,11

"and in all honesty , i confess that this venturesome excursion was far from displeasing to me . i ca n't express the intensity of my amazement at the beauties of these new regions . the ice struck superb poses . here , its general effect suggested an oriental town with countless minarets and mosques . there , a city in ruins , flung to the ground by convulsions in the earth . these views were varied continuously by the sun 's oblique rays , or were completely swallowed up by gray mists in the middle of blizzards . then explosions , cave - ins , and great iceberg somersaults would occur all around us , altering the scenery like the changing landscape in a diorama .",21
""" perhaps here , perhaps in china . you know how quickly the nautilus moves . it crosses oceans like swallows cross the air or express trains continents . it does n't fear heavily traveled seas . who can say it wo n't hug the coasts of france , england , or america , where an escape attempt could be carried out just as effectively as here . """,25
and truly pencroft only expressed the opinion of all .,4
"when i was come down the hill to the shore , as i said above , being the sw . point of the island , i was perfectly confounded and amazed ; nor is it possible for me to express the horror of my mind at seeing the shore spread with skulls , hands , feet , and other bones of human bodies ; and particularly i observed a place where there had been a fire made , and a circle dug in the earth , like a cockpit , where i supposed the savage wretches had sat down to their human feastings upon the bodies of their fellow - creatures .",39
in two minutes he rose from the stile : his face expressed pain when he tried to move .,11
"as to cyrus harding , he did not speak ; he simply gazed , and by the mistrust which his look expressed , it appeared that he was examining some strange country .",21
""" i _ do _ love you , "" i said , "" more than ever : but i must not show or indulge the feeling : and this is the last time i must express it . """,35
"it was with a renewed feeling of disappointment that she waved the tattered lace handkerchief from the window , as her son drove away . she was conscious that a great opportunity had been wasted . she consoled herself by telling sibyl how desolate she felt her life would be , now that she had only one child to look after . she remembered the phrase . it had pleased her . of the threat she said nothing . it was vividly and dramatically expressed . she felt that they would all laugh at it some day .",84
no artist is ever morbid . the artist can express everything .,9
""" yes , i have a turn both for observation and for deduction . the theories which i have expressed there , and which appear to you to be so chimerical are really extremely practical — so practical that i depend upon them for my bread and cheese . """,19
"inside the mediterranean , then , i could catch no more of its fast - passing scenery than a traveler might see from an express train ; in other words , i could view only the distant horizons because the foregrounds flashed by like lightning . but conseil and i were able to observe those mediterranean fish whose powerful fins kept pace for a while in the nautilus 's waters . we stayed on watch before the lounge windows , and our notes enable me to reconstruct , in a few words , the ichthyology of this sea .",24
i made a movement intended to express resignation .,6
"as for our neglect , our isolation in the depths of this cell , i was afraid to guess at how long it might last . little by little , hopes i had entertained after our interview with the ship 's commander were fading away . the gentleness of the man 's gaze , the generosity expressed in his facial features , the nobility of his bearing , all vanished from my memory . i saw this mystifying individual anew for what he inevitably must be : cruel and merciless . i viewed him as outside humanity , beyond all feelings of compassion , the implacable foe of his fellow man , toward whom he must have sworn an undying hate !",56
"while cruising along only a few cable lengths from the underpinning of reao island , i marveled at the gigantic piece of work accomplished by these microscopic laborers . these walls were the express achievements of madrepores known by the names fire coral , finger coral , star coral , and stony coral . these polyps grow exclusively in the agitated strata at the surface of the sea , and so it 's in the upper reaches that they begin these substructures , which sink little by little together with the secreted rubble binding them . this , at least , is the theory of mr . charles darwin , who thus explains the formation of atolls -- a theory superior , in my view , to the one that says these madreporic edifices sit on the summits of mountains or volcanoes submerged a few feet below sea level .",33
