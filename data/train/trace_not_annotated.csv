"nor was this all . fresh discoveries of remains in the pleiocene formation had emboldened other geologists to refer back the human species to a higher antiquity still . it is true that these remains were not human bones , but objects bearing the traces of his handiwork , such as fossil leg - bones of animals , sculptured and carved evidently by the hand of man .",44

"many traces we found of him in the bog - girt island where he had hid his savage ally . a huge driving - wheel and a shaft half - filled with rubbish showed the position of an abandoned mine . beside it were the crumbling remains of the cottages of the miners , driven away no doubt by the foul reek of the surrounding swamp . in one of these a staple and chain with a quantity of gnawed bones showed where the animal had been confined . a skeleton with a tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the debris .",1
"his idea was still with me , because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse , nor a sand - traced effigy storms could wash away ; it was a name graven on a tablet , fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed .",21

"possessed by one single thought -- that of the promise he had made , and of the responsibility he had taken -- he retired last to his chamber , begged the host to procure him a map of the province , bent over it , examined every line traced upon it , perceived that there were four different roads from bethune to armentieres , and summoned the lackeys .",48

"the perimeter of the corral was then traced by the engineer , and they would then have proceeded to fell the trees necessary for the construction of the palisade , but as the opening up of the road had already necessitated the sacrifice of a considerable number , those were brought and supplied a hundred stakes , which were firmly fixed in the ground .",7
"it is true that , as gideon spilett observed , any remains of it might have drifted out to sea , and they must not take it for granted that because they could find no traces of it , a ship had not been castaway on the coast .",35

"just then i was in the bow , leaning over the starboard rail . conseil , stationed beside me , stared straight ahead . roosting in the shrouds , the crew examined the horizon , which shrank and darkened little by little . officers were probing the increasing gloom with their night glasses . sometimes the murky ocean sparkled beneath moonbeams that darted between the fringes of two clouds . then all traces of light vanished into the darkness .",72
"he admitted , however , although with hesitation , that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable origin — to the severe and long - continued illness — indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution — of a tenderly beloved sister , his sole companion for long years , his last and only relative on earth .",21

"from the extremity of the promontory which formed the tail of the peninsula the coast was rounded for a distance of five miles , which was rapidly passed over , without even the most minute investigations bringing to light the least trace of any old or recent landings ; no debris , no mark of an encampment , no cinders of a fire , nor even a footprint !",41

"through the beds of schist , coloured with delicate shades of green , ran in winding course threads of copper and manganese , with traces of platinum and gold . i thought , what riches are here buried at an unapproachable depth in the earth , hidden for ever from the covetous eyes of the human race ! these treasures have been buried at such a profound depth by the convulsions of primeval times that they run no chance of ever being molested by the pickaxe or the spade .",24

""" this was the first point gained . i then walked slowly down the garden path , which happened to be composed of a clay soil , peculiarly suitable for taking impressions . no doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush , but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning . there is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps . happily , i have always laid great stress upon it , and much practice has made it second nature to me . i saw the heavy footmarks of the constables , but i saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden . it was easy to tell that they had been before the others , because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them . in this way my second link was formed , which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number , one remarkable for his height ( as i calculated from the length of his stride ) , and the other fashionably dressed , to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots .",81
