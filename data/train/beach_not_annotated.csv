"at the beach , on which lay the body of the dugong , the water was tolerably shallow , but from this point the bottom of the lake sloped gradually , and it was probable that the depth was considerable in the center .",2
not even a pebble recently displaced ; not a trace on the sand ; not a human footstep on all that part of the beach .,24
"there , in place of natural wonders , the watery mass offered some thrilling and dreadful scenes to my eyes . in essence , we were then crossing that part of the whole mediterranean so fertile in casualties . from the coast of algiers to the beaches of provence , how many ships have wrecked , how many vessels have vanished ! compared to the vast liquid plains of the pacific , the mediterranean is a mere lake , but it 's an unpredictable lake with fickle waves , today kindly and affectionate to those frail single - masters drifting between a double ultramarine of sky and water , tomorrow bad - tempered and turbulent , agitated by the winds , demolishing the strongest ships beneath sudden waves that smash down with a headlong wallop .",46
"in the northeast there emerged two volcanic islands of unequal size , surrounded by a coral reef whose circuit measured forty miles . we were facing the island of vanikoro proper , to which captain dumont d'urville had given the name "" island of the search "" ; we lay right in front of the little harbor of vana , located in latitude 16 degrees 4 ' south and longitude 164 degrees 32 ' east . its shores seemed covered with greenery from its beaches to its summits inland , crowned by mt . kapogo , which is 476 fathoms high .",84
you would like very well to be at liberty on that beach !,11
"from that day forward , who knows where the nautilus took us in the north atlantic basin ? always at incalculable speed ! always amid the high arctic mists ! did it call at the capes of spitzbergen or the shores of novaya zemlya ? did it visit such uncharted seas as the white sea , the kara sea , the gulf of ob , the lyakhov islands , or those unknown beaches on the siberian coast ? i 'm unable to say . i lost track of the passing hours . time was in abeyance on the ship 's clocks . as happens in the polar regions , it seemed that night and day no longer followed their normal sequence . i felt myself being drawn into that strange domain where the overwrought imagination of edgar allan poe was at home . like his fabled arthur gordon pym , i expected any moment to see that "" shrouded human figure , very far larger in its proportions than any dweller among men , "" thrown across the cataract that protects the outskirts of the pole !",72
"near 5:30 the first glimmers of light on the horizon defined the upper lines of the coast with greater distinctness . fairly flat to the east , it swelled a little toward the south . five miles still separated it from us , and its beach merged with the misty waters . between us and the shore , the sea was deserted . not a boat , not a diver . profound solitude reigned over this gathering place of pearl fishermen . as captain nemo had commented , we were arriving in these waterways a month too soon .",45
"finally , at five o'clock in the afternoon , laden with all our treasures , we left the island beach and half an hour later pulled alongside the nautilus . nobody appeared on our arrival . the enormous sheet - iron cylinder seemed deserted . our provisions loaded on board , i went below to my stateroom . there i found my supper ready . i ate and then fell asleep .",19
"a sandy beach unfolded before us , measuring 500 feet at its widest point between the waters of the lake and the foot of the mountain 's walls . via this strand you could easily circle the lake . but the base of these high walls consisted of broken soil over which there lay picturesque piles of volcanic blocks and enormous pumice stones . all these crumbling masses were covered with an enamel polished by the action of underground fires , and they glistened under the stream of electric light from our beacon . stirred up by our footsteps , the mica - rich dust on this beach flew into the air like a cloud of sparks .",2

"and this reaction was n't long in coming . for three months , during which each day seemed like a century , the abraham lincoln plowed all the northerly seas of the pacific , racing after whales sighted , abruptly veering off course , swerving sharply from one tack to another , stopping suddenly , putting on steam and reversing engines in quick succession , at the risk of stripping its gears , and it did n't leave a single point unexplored from the beaches of japan to the coasts of america . and we found nothing ! nothing except an immenseness of deserted waves ! nothing remotely resembling a gigantic narwhale , or an underwater islet , or a derelict shipwreck , or a runaway reef , or anything the least bit unearthly !",84
the nearest point of the beach he could reach was thus fully that distance off .,5
"as additional precaution , pencroft , neb , and ayrton drew it up on a little beach which bordered one of the sides of the grotto , in a spot where it could run no risk of harm .",16
"at six o'clock in the morning , january 8 , i climbed onto the platform . the morning shadows were lifting . the island was soon on view through the dissolving mists , first its beaches , then its summits .",35
"so the skiff did n't leave shipside that day , much to the displeasure of mr . land who could n't complete his provisions . the adroit canadian spent his time preparing the meat and flour products he had brought from gueboroa island . as for the savages , they went back to shore near eleven o'clock in the morning , when the heads of coral began to disappear under the waves of the rising tide . but i saw their numbers swell considerably on the beach . it was likely that they had come from neighboring islands or from the mainland of papua proper . however , i did n't see one local dugout canoe .",86
"however , it would be surprising , even in this case , that some of the masts or spars should not have been thrown on the beach , out of reach of the waves . """,26
"imagine the joy of the little crew of the "" bonadventure . "" in a few hours they would land on the beach of the island !",22
"twice , during one of these hurricanes , the mercy swelled to such a degree as to give reason to fear that the bridges would be swept away , and it was necessary to strengthen those on the shore , which disappeared under the foaming waters , when the sea beat against the beach .",53
"after our position fix , the nautilus 's latitude bearings were modulated to the southwest . our prow pointed to the indian ocean . where would captain nemo 's fancies take us ? would he head up to the shores of asia ? would he pull nearer to the beaches of europe ? unlikely choices for a man who avoided populated areas ! so would he go down south ? would he double the cape of good hope , then cape horn , and push on to the antarctic pole ? finally , would he return to the seas of the pacific , where his nautilus could navigate freely and easily ? time would tell .",49
""" i went along the coast for another two miles , carefully examining the beach , both at high and low water , and i had despaired of finding anything , when yesterday , above five in the evening , i saw footprints on the sand . """,14
"the canoe was hauled up on the beach near the chimneys , and all proceeded towards the ladder of granite house .",7
"we were walking on sand that was fine - grained and smooth , not wrinkled like beach sand , which preserves the impressions left by the waves . this dazzling carpet was a real mirror , throwing back the sun 's rays with startling intensity . the outcome : an immense vista of reflections that penetrated every liquid molecule . will anyone believe me if i assert that at this thirty - foot depth , i could see as if it was broad daylight ?",16
"but the vegetation did not extend far , and a long , sandy plain , which began at the foot of these slopes , reached to the beach .",27
"it was , therefore , much better to tow it to the beach at granite house .",12
"by means of the cord they would then be able to draw down the ladder to the ground , and so re - establish the communication between the beach and granite house .",28
"meanwhile i was carefully examining these unleashed breakers . they measured up to fifteen meters in height over a length of 150 to 175 meters , and the speed of their propagation ( half that of the wind ) was fifteen meters per second . their volume and power increased with the depth of the waters . i then understood the role played by these waves , which trap air in their flanks and release it in the depths of the sea where its oxygen brings life . their utmost pressure -- it has been calculated-- can build to 3,000 kilograms on every square foot of surface they strike . it was such waves in the hebrides that repositioned a stone block weighing 84,000 pounds . it was their relatives in the tidal wave on december 23 , 1854 , that toppled part of the japanese city of tokyo , then went that same day at 700 kilometers per hour to break on the beaches of america .",164
"there the ocean floor formed a valley 120 kilometers wide , into which you could fit mt . blanc without its summit poking above the surface of the waves . this valley is closed off to the east by a sheer wall 2,000 meters high . we arrived there on may 28 , and the nautilus lay no farther than 150 kilometers from ireland . would captain nemo head up north and beach us on the british isles ? no . much to my surprise , he went back down south and returned to european seas . as we swung around the emerald isle , i spotted cape clear for an instant , plus the lighthouse on fastnet rock that guides all those thousands of ships setting out from glasgow or liverpool .",72
"in the evening i took a short walk on the beach and returned at night to my plank - bed , where i slept soundly all night .",10
"the beach was strewn with mollusks : small mussels , limpets , smooth heart - shaped cockles , and especially some sea butterflies with oblong , membrane - filled bodies whose heads are formed from two rounded lobes . i also saw myriads of those northernmost sea butterflies three centimeters long , which a baleen whale can swallow by the thousands in one gulp . the open waters at the shoreline were alive with these delightful pteropods , true butterflies of the sea .",1
"the mediterranean , your ideal blue sea : to greeks simply "" the sea , "" to hebrews "" the great sea , "" to romans mare nostrum . bordered by orange trees , aloes , cactus , and maritime pine trees , perfumed with the scent of myrtle , framed by rugged mountains , saturated with clean , transparent air but continuously under construction by fires in the earth , this sea is a genuine battlefield where neptune and pluto still struggle for world domination . here on these beaches and waters , says the french historian michelet , a man is revived by one of the most invigorating climates in the world .",90
"the water became red with blood , and the body of the dugong , emerging from the sheet of scarlet which spread around , soon stranded on a little beach at the south angle of the lake .",29
the engineer and the reporter soon reached the little beach on which the dugong had been stranded .,9
