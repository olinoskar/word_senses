"the commanding officer of fort kearney was there . a hundred of his soldiers had placed themselves in a position to defend the station , should the sioux attack it .",2
"an officer who saw me , with a jealous eye , reading the lives of the saints to the mistress of the house , entered suddenly and without being announced .",1
"the officer waited for his reply , and seeing it so long coming , he burst into a laugh , turned upon his heel , and re - entered the house .",1
just then captain nemo and his chief officer appeared .,7
"as i expected , my officer was there . i went up to him as he was singing a love ditty and looking tenderly at a lady , and interrupted him exactly in the middle of the second couplet . ’ monsieur , ’ said i , ’ does it still displease you that i should frequent a certain house of la rue payenne ?",5
"the officer looked at me with astonishment , and then said , ’ what is your business with me , monsieur ?",1
"the captain said a few words to his chief officer who went out immediately . soon the nautilus reentered its liquid element , and the pressure gauge indicated that it was staying at a depth of thirty feet .",9
"this verse , into which the terrible enchantress threw her whole soul , completed the trouble which had seized the heart of the young officer . he opened the door quickly ; and milady saw him appear , pale as usual , but with his eye inflamed and almost wild .",24
"they looked in vain . the hope and the search passed right by vanikoro without stopping there ; and overall , this voyage was plagued by misfortune , ultimately costing the lives of rear admiral d'entrecasteaux , two of his subordinate officers , and several seamen from his crew .",41
"so captain dumont d'urville had put to sea in command of a vessel named after the astrolabe , and just two months after dillon had left vanikoro , dumont d'urville dropped anchor before hobart . there he heard about dillon 's findings , and he further learned that a certain james hobbs , chief officer on the union out of calcutta , had put to shore on an island located in latitude 8 degrees 18 ' south and longitude 156 degrees 30 ' east , and had noted the natives of those waterways making use of iron bars and red fabrics .",54
"this boat contained an officer , a mate , and eight rowers . the officer alone went on board , where he was received with all the deference inspired by the uniform .",14
"the officer conversed a few instants with the captain , gave him several papers , of which he was the bearer , to read , and upon the order of the merchant captain the whole crew of the vessel , both passengers and sailors , were called upon deck .",1
"during the examination of milady by the officer , as may well be imagined , milady on her part was not less scrutinizing in her glances .",7
"but on the 26th , appeased with gifts and seeing that they did n't need to fear any reprisals , the natives led the chief officer , mr . jacquinot , to the site of the shipwreck .",25
"and at these words , as if all her strength was exhausted , milady sank , weak and languishing , into the arms of the young officer , who , intoxicated with love , anger , and voluptuous sensations hitherto unknown , received her with transport , pressed her against his heart , all trembling at the breath from that charming mouth , bewildered by the contact with that palpitating bosom .",26
"i repaired to my stateroom . the captain and his chief officer stayed on the platform . the propeller was set in motion . the nautilus swiftly retreated , putting us outside the range of the vessel 's shells . but the chase continued , and captain nemo was content to keep his distance .",11
""" the custom , "" said the great officer , "" is to embrace the king and kiss him on each cheek . """,8
""" you may perceive , madame , by my uniform , that i am an officer in the english navy , "" replied the young man .",15
"the officer leaped to the pier , and offered his hand to milady .",1
"the officer saw that the baggage was fastened carefully behind the carriage ; and this operation ended , he took his place beside milady , and shut the door .",1
"papua is 400 leagues long by 130 leagues wide , with a surface area of 40,000 geographic leagues . it 's located between latitude 0 degrees 19 ' and 10 degrees 2 ' south , and between longitude 128 degrees 23 ' and 146 degrees 15 ' . at noon , while the chief officer was taking the sun 's altitude , i spotted the summits of the arfak mountains , rising in terraces and ending in sharp peaks .",54
"so strange a reception naturally gave milady ample matter for reflection ; so seeing that the young officer did not seem at all disposed for conversation , she reclined in her corner of the carriage , and one after the other passed in review all the surmises which presented themselves to her mind .",17
the young officer preserved silence .,2
no voice replied to hers ; the carriage continued to roll on with rapidity ; the officer seemed a statue .,16
"when i stood up , i saw captain nemo and his chief officer on the platform . they were examining the ship 's circumstances , exchanging a few words in their incomprehensible dialect .",12
"i estimate -- but perhaps i 'm mistaken -- that the nautilus 's haphazard course continued for fifteen or twenty days , and i 'm not sure how long this would have gone on without the catastrophe that ended our voyage . as for captain nemo , he was no longer in the picture . as for his chief officer , the same applied . not one crewman was visible for a single instant . the nautilus cruised beneath the waters almost continuously . when it rose briefly to the surface to renew our air , the hatches opened and closed as if automated . no more positions were reported on the world map . i did n't know where we were .",59
"the officer leaned forward , looked at her in his turn , and appeared surprised to see that face , just before so beautiful , distorted with passion and almost hideous .",1
"this said , captain nemo went below again to the nautilus 's interior , followed by his chief officer . as for our craft , it no longer stirred , staying as motionless as if these coral polyps had already walled it in with their indestructible cement .",18
""" still , then , i am a prisoner , "" said milady , looking around her , and bringing back her eyes with a most gracious smile to the young officer ; "" but i feel assured it will not be for long , "" added she . "" my own conscience and your politeness , sir , are the guarantees of that . """,31
""" it is some superior officer making his night rounds , "" said athos . "" what do you wish , gentlemen ? """,5
"the officer superintended all these details with the same calmness milady had constantly seen in him , never pronouncing a word himself , and making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his whistle .",1
""" your pardon , my officer , "" said athos ; "" but we were ignorant with whom we had to do , and you may see that we were good guard . """,5
"at noon the sun made a momentary appearance . taking advantage of this rift in the clouds , the chief officer took the orb 's altitude . then the sea grew turbulent , we went below again , and the hatch closed once more .",20
""" that person is here , madame , "" said the officer , leaving the entrance open , and drawing himself up in an attitude of respect .",11
"then , turning toward the door , and seeing that the young officer was waiting for his last orders , he said .",12
"as for the crew , they only wanted to encounter the unicorn , harpoon it , haul it on board , and carve it up . they surveyed the sea with scrupulous care . besides , commander farragut had mentioned that a certain sum of $ 2,000.00 was waiting for the man who first sighted the animal , be he cabin boy or sailor , mate or officer . i 'll let the reader decide whether eyes got proper exercise aboard the abraham lincoln .",67
he knew the engineer - officer by reputation ; he knew with what impatience that determined man chafed under his restraint .,5
milady mounted upon a chair and passed the upper part of her body through the window . she saw the young officer suspended over the abyss by a ladder of ropes .,21
"after two hours of energetic work , ned land reentered , exhausted . he and his companions were replaced by new workmen , including conseil and me . the nautilus 's chief officer supervised us .",32
"the door opened ; two guards received bonacieux in their arms from the officer who supported him . they carried him through an alley , up a flight of stairs , and deposited him in an antechamber .",13
"at this moment an officer with a pleasant face opened a door , continued to exchange some words with a person in the next chamber and then came up to the prisoner .",4
""" yes , monsieur officer , "" stammered the mercer , more dead than alive , "" at your service . """,4
"the officer took from the table the papers pointed out , gave them to him who asked for them , bowed to the ground , and retired .",1
"in order to make one ’s way amid these turbulent and conflicting waves , it was necessary to be an officer , a great noble , or a pretty woman .",20
"his lackey , who , by an unforeseen piece of ill luck , had quarreled with the officers , disguised as stable lads-- """,17
""" saved ! "" replied the young officer .",7
the young officer entered .,2
""" my lord , "" said the young officer , summoning to his mild countenance all the hatred he could find in his heart , "" my lord , i swear all shall be done as you desire . """,8
""" really , sir , "" replied the officer , "" i can not possibly wait on you farther than lower normandy . """,8
51 officer,1
""" but , "" cried the young officer , "" speak , then , speak ! """,7
""" the count is here , "" said the officer , "" and requests to speak with your eminence instantly . """,9
"the baron entered slowly , sending a scrutinizing glance from milady to the young officer .",14
"the streets at last became quiet , and the patrol , the officers of which , in their splendid costumes , and surrounded by their suites , passepartout thought seemed like ambassadors , succeeded the bustling crowd . each time a company passed , passepartout chuckled , and said to himself : "" good ! another japanese embassy departing for europe ! """,12
"by then all our past sufferings were forgotten . the memory of that imprisonment under the ice faded from our minds . we had thoughts only of the future . captain nemo no longer appeared , neither in the lounge nor on the platform . the positions reported each day on the world map were put there by the chief officer , and they enabled me to determine the nautilus 's exact heading . now then , that evening it became obvious , much to my satisfaction , that we were returning north by the atlantic route .",60
"the baron took the young officer by the arm , and turned his head over his shoulder , so as not to lose sight of milady till he was gone out .",5
""" officer ! "" cried grimaud .",1
""" are the english expected by land , or do the musketeers consider themselves superior officers ? """,15
""" monseigneur , "" replied athos , for amid the general fright he alone had preserved the noble calmness and coolness that never forsook him , "" monseigneur , the musketeers , when they are not on duty , or when their duty is over , drink and play at dice , and they are certainly superior officers to their lackeys . """,57
"at the name of lord de winter , who was known to be one of his grace ’s most intimate friends , the officer of the post gave orders to let felton pass , who , besides , wore the uniform of a naval officer .",44
""" but rest assured , "" i added , "" that between passengers , seamen , or officers , we do n't total one - tenth of that figure . """,17
""" what would you have , officer ? the papers were mistaken . """,6
the same officer appeared .,2
"m bonacieux was introduced afresh , and upon a sign from the cardinal , the officer retired .",15
""" holy virgin ! "" cried she , "" what will become of us ? a man killed in my apartment ! if the peace - officers come , we are undone . """,26

""" well , "" said she , returning the knife to the young officer , "" this is fine and good steel . you are a faithful friend , felton . """,13
the officer entered for the fourth time .,1
"the request was needless . the young officer stood upright before her , awaiting her words as if to devour them .",7
"but the nautilus wanted nothing to do with these nasty animals . timor island was visible for barely an instant at noon while the chief officer determined his position . i also caught only a glimpse of little roti island , part of this same group , whose women have a well - established reputation for beauty in the malaysian marketplace .",25
"the nautilus was certainly afloat , but it was no longer in motion . the blades of its propeller were n't churning the waves . a minute passed . followed by his chief officer , captain nemo entered the lounge .",33
"i had n't seen him for a good while . he looked gloomy to me . without speaking to us , without even seeing us perhaps , he went to the panel , stared at the devilfish , and said a few words to his chief officer . the latter went out . soon the panels closed . the ceiling lit up .",46
"the reporter and the lad secured a good store of the precious plant , and then returned to granite house , where they smuggled it in with as much precaution as if pencroft had been the most vigilant and severe of custom - house officers .",44
"i had climbed onto the platform just as the chief officer was taking his readings of hour angles . out of habit i waited for him to pronounce his daily phrase . but that day it was replaced by a different phrase , just as incomprehensible . almost at once i saw captain nemo appear , lift his spyglass , and inspect the horizon .",10
"the poor fellow was done for . who could tear him from such a powerful grip ? even so , captain nemo rushed at the devilfish and with a sweep of the ax hewed one more of its arms . his chief officer struggled furiously with other monsters crawling up the nautilus 's sides . the crew battled with flailing axes . the canadian , conseil , and i sank our weapons into these fleshy masses . an intense , musky odor filled the air . it was horrible .",42
"the chief officer kept lifting his spyglass and stubbornly examining the horizon , walking up and down , stamping his foot , in his nervous agitation a sharp contrast to his superior .",2
"just then the chief officer drew the captain 's attention anew . the latter interrupted his strolling and aimed his spyglass at the point indicated . he observed it a good while . as for me , deeply puzzled , i went below to the lounge and brought back an excellent long - range telescope i habitually used . leaning my elbows on the beacon housing , which jutted from the stern of the platform , i got set to scour that whole stretch of sky and sea . but no sooner had i peered into the eyepiece than the instrument was snatched from my hands .",4
"finally captain nemo regained his self - control . his facial appearance , so profoundly changed , now resumed its usual calm . he addressed a few words to his chief officer in their strange language , then he turned to me :",31
""" oh , do not kill me ! "" cried the bandit . "" pardon , pardon , my officer , and i will tell you all . """,19
"diana 's husband is a captain in the navy , a gallant officer and a good man .",12
""" tell me who this man was ! "" cried the young officer .",12
""" what diabolical villainy you have performed here , "" said porthos , when the officer had rejoined his companions and the four friends found themselves alone .",15
""" shall i give you the change , my officer ? "" said the host .",9
"after renewing its air , the nautilus stayed at an average depth of fifteen meters , enabling it to return quickly to the surface of the waves . and , contrary to custom , it executed such a maneuver several times during that day of january 19 . the chief officer would then climb onto the platform , and his usual phrase would ring through the ship 's interior .",50
"notice was given to the main guard , and immediately a paraguayan officer ran to throw himself at the feet of the commandant to impart this news to him .",12
"nevertheless , he did n't waste an instant . at his signal , the chief officer appeared . the two men held a quick exchange in their incomprehensible language , and either the chief officer had been alerted previously or he found the plan feasible , because he showed no surprise .",15
"nevertheless , he did n't waste an instant . at his signal , the chief officer appeared . the two men held a quick exchange in their incomprehensible language , and either the chief officer had been alerted previously or he found the plan feasible , because he showed no surprise .",34
"by the next morning , november 18 , i was fully recovered from my exhaustion of the day before , and i climbed onto the platform just as the nautilus 's chief officer was pronouncing his daily phrase . it then occurred to me that these words either referred to the state of the sea , or that they meant : "" there 's nothing in sight . """,32
"' --and just take his head off outside , ' the queen added to one of the officers : but the hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door .",28
""" i ? "" said she , with an accent of disdain in unison with that which she had remarked in the voice of the young officer , "" i , sir ? my mass ?",26
"over the ensuing days and weeks , captain nemo was very frugal with his visits . i saw him only at rare intervals . his chief officer regularly fixed the positions i found reported on the chart , and in such a way that i could exactly plot the nautilus 's course .",26
"the young officer , however , remained mute and motionless ; his look alone had spoken .",2
"that day , january 21 , 1868 , the chief officer went at noon to take the sun 's altitude . i climbed onto the platform , lit a cigar , and watched him at work . it seemed obvious to me that this man did n't understand french , because i made several remarks in a loud voice that were bound to provoke him to some involuntary show of interest had he understood them ; but he remained mute and emotionless .",10
"to convince you of the truth of what i say , take the habit he has on and carry it to the first barrier of the jesuits ' kingdom , and inquire whether my master did not kill one of their officers .",41
