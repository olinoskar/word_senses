""" hum ! someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements .

""" it is a formidable difficulty , and i fear that you ask too much when you expect me to solve it . the past and the present are within the field of my inquiry , but what a man may do in the future is a hard question to answer . mrs . stapleton has heard her husband discuss the problem on several occasions . there were three possible courses . he might claim the property from south america , establish his identity before the british authorities there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to england at all ; or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the short time that he need be in london ; or , again , he might furnish an accomplice with the proofs and papers , putting him in as heir , and retaining a claim upon some proportion of his income . we can not doubt from what we know of him that he would have found some way out of the difficulty . and now , my dear watson , we have had some weeks of severe work , and for one evening , i think , we may turn our thoughts into more pleasant channels . i have a box for ' les huguenots .

"few children can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey ; nor could i. bessie , having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and bread she had prepared for me , wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and put them into my bag ; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet , and wrapping herself in a shawl , she and i left the nursery .",46

"for years , dorian gray could not free himself from the influence of this book . or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never sought to free himself from it . he procured from paris no less than nine large - paper copies of the first edition , and had them bound in different colours , so that they might suit his various moods and the changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed , at times , to have almost entirely lost control . the hero , the wonderful young parisian in whom the romantic and the scientific temperaments were so strangely blended , became to him a kind of prefiguring type of himself . and , indeed , the whole book seemed to him to contain the story of his own life , written before he had lived it .",45
"but there were ample signs that i had not come upon a false scent . this was certainly where the man lived . some blankets rolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which neolithic man had once slumbered . the ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate . beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket half - full of water . a litter of empty tins showed that the place had been occupied for some time , and i saw , as my eyes became accustomed to the checkered light , a pannikin and a half - full bottle of spirits standing in the corner . in the middle of the hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table , and upon this stood a small cloth bundle -- the same , no doubt , which i had seen through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy . it contained a loaf of bread , a tinned tongue , and two tins of preserved peaches . as i set it down again , after having examined it , my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it . i raised it , and this was what i read , roughly scrawled in pencil:--",203
"in consequence thereof they had seized on a biscayan for marrying his godmother , and on two portuguese for taking out the bacon of a larded pullet they were eating ; after dinner they came and secured dr . pangloss , and his pupil candide , the one for speaking his mind , and the other for seeming to approve what he had said . they were conducted to separate apartments , extremely cool , where they were never incommoded with the sun . eight days afterwards they were each dressed in a sanbenito , and their heads were adorned with paper mitres . the mitre and sanbenito worn by candide were painted with flames reversed and with devils that had neither tails nor claws ; but dr . pangloss 's devils had both tails and claws , and his flames were upright .",101

"a square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall , approached by a double stair . from this central point two long corridors extended the whole length of the building , from which all the bedrooms opened . my own was in the same wing as baskerville 's and almost next door to it . these rooms appeared to be much more modern than the central part of the house , and the bright paper and numerous candles did something to remove the sombre impression which our arrival had left upon my mind .",77

"sir henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast , so that the time was propitious for my excursion . it was a pleasant walk of four miles along the edge of the moor , leading me at last to a small gray hamlet , in which two larger buildings , which proved to be the inn and the house of dr . mortimer , stood high above the rest . the postmaster , who was also the village grocer , had a clear recollection of the telegram .",4

"alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage , not much larger than a rat - hole : she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw . how she longed to get out of that dark hall , and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains , but she could not even get her head though the doorway ; ' and even if my head would go through , ' thought poor alice , ' it would be of very little use without my shoulders . oh , how i wish i could shut up like a telescope ! i think i could , if i only know how to begin . ' for , you see , so many out - of - the - way things had happened lately , that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible . there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door , so she went back to the table , half hoping she might find another key on it , or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes : this time she found a little bottle on it , ( ' which certainly was not here before , ' said alice , ) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label , with the words ' drink me ' beautifully printed on it in large letters .",243
