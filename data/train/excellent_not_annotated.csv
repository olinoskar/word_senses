"immediately two waiters and two servant - girls , dressed in cloth of gold , and their hair braided with ribbons of tissue , accosted the strangers and invited them to sit down to the ordinary . their dinner consisted of four dishes of different soups , each garnished with two young paroquets , a large dish of bouille that weighed two hundred weight , two roasted monkeys of a delicious flavor , three hundred hummingbirds in one dish , and six hundred flybirds in another ; some excellent ragouts , delicate tarts , and the whole served up in dishes of rock - crystal . several sorts of liquors , extracted from the sugarcane , were handed about by the servants who attended .",88

"like a covey of snipe over a marsh , there rose underfoot schools of unusual fish from the genus monopterus , whose members have no fin but their tail . i recognized the javanese eel , a genuine eight - decimeter serpent with a bluish gray belly , which , without the gold lines over its flanks , could easily be confused with the conger eel . from the butterfish genus , whose oval bodies are very flat , i observed several adorned in brilliant colors and sporting a dorsal fin like a sickle , edible fish that , when dried and marinated , make an excellent dish known by the name "" karawade "" ; then some sea poachers , fish belonging to the genus aspidophoroides , whose bodies are covered with scaly armor divided into eight lengthwise sections .",106

"and they opened amazingly wide . eyes and spyglasses ( a bit dazzled , it is true , by the vista of $ 2,000.00 ) did n't remain at rest for an instant . day and night we observed the surface of the ocean , and those with nyctalopic eyes , whose ability to see in the dark increased their chances by fifty percent , had an excellent shot at winning the prize .",67

"after leaving these delightful islands to the protection of the french flag , the nautilus covered about 2,000 miles from december 4 to the 11th . its navigating was marked by an encounter with an immense school of squid , unusual mollusks that are near neighbors of the cuttlefish . french fishermen give them the name "" cuckoldfish , "" and they belong to the class cephalopoda , family dibranchiata , consisting of themselves together with cuttlefish and argonauts . the naturalists of antiquity made a special study of them , and these animals furnished many ribald figures of speech for soapbox orators in the greek marketplace , as well as excellent dishes for the tables of rich citizens , if we 're to believe athenaeus , a greek physician predating galen .",111
