""" well , indeed , my worthy uncle , you are never at a loss for an answer . """,6
""" do n't talk to me about her , john : i told you not to go near her ; she is not worthy of notice ; i do not choose that either you or your sisters should associate with her . """,23
"when i saw myself thus far removed from all earthly help i had recourse to heavenly succour . the remembrance of my childhood , the recollection of my mother , whom i had only known in my tender early years , came back to me , and i knelt in prayer imploring for the divine help of which i was so little worthy . this return of trust in god 's providence allayed the turbulence of my fears , and i was enabled to concentrate upon my situation all the force of my intelligence .",62
"to this crib i always took my doll ; human beings must love something , and , in the dearth of worthier objects of affection , i contrived to find a pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image , shabby as a miniature scarecrow .",21
"yes , these men were worthy to reconcile captain nemo with that humanity which they represented so nobly in the island .",5
"i am admiring three magnificent horses which the stable boys are leading about . it would be a pleasure worthy of a prince to travel upon such horses . """,19
""" i do not speak to the feeble , or think of them : i address only such as are worthy of the work , and competent to accomplish it . """,20
"the reporter , to whom his tedious captivity did not offer a single incident worthy of note , could stand it no longer .",14
"she knew her brother - in - law to be a worthy gentleman , a bold hunter , an intrepid player , enterprising with women , but by no means remarkable for his skill in intrigues .",11
"we must mention here that pencroft , desirous to know if the clay thus prepared was worthy of its name of pipe - clay , made some large pipes , which he thought charming , but for which , alas ! he had no tobacco , and that was a great privation to pencroft .",16
""" for my part , i think what they say is very well said , and quite worthy of two gentlemen . """,17
""" madame , "" said he , with dignity , "" there will shortly be a ball at the hotel de ville . i wish , in order to honor our worthy aldermen , you should appear in ceremonial costume , and above all , ornamented with the diamond studs which i gave you on your birthday .",31
"it resulted from these antecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which they met ; besides , it would not be unlikely that they would have an opportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn , and for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always ready .",47
"her daughter was about seventeen years of age , fresh - colored , comely , plump , and desirable . the baron 's son seemed to be a youth in every respect worthy of the father he sprung from .",32
it may readily be understood that this similarity of tastes of jup and pencroft served to tighten the bonds of friendship which already existed between the honest ape and the worthy sailor .,30
"first of all , the worthy fellow had gone up to his room , and had extinguished the gas burner , which had been burning for eighty days . he had found in the letter - box a bill from the gas company , and he thought it more than time to put a stop to this expense , which he had been doomed to bear .",5
"and the worthy fellow returned the watch to its fob with a defiant gesture . after a few minutes silence , fix resumed : "" you left london hastily , then ? """,2
"he is a worthy , honest man who entertains neither love nor hatred for anybody .",3
"he brushed their clothes , he turned the spit , he waited at table , he swept the rooms , he gathered wood , and he performed another admirable piece of service which delighted pencroft -- he never went to sleep without first coming to tuck up the worthy sailor in his bed .",48
"the worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat as hearty a breakfast as possible before leaving the carnatic ; but , as he had been walking about all day , the demands of hunger were becoming importunate . he observed that the butchers stalls contained neither mutton , goat , nor pork ; and , knowing also that it is a sacrilege to kill cattle , which are preserved solely for farming , he made up his mind that meat was far from plentiful in yokohama -- nor was he mistaken ; and , in default of butcher 's meat , he could have wished for a quarter of wild boar or deer , a partridge , or some quails , some game or fish , which , with rice , the japanese eat almost exclusively . but he found it necessary to keep up a stout heart , and to postpone the meal he craved till the following morning . night came , and passepartout re - entered the native quarter , where he wandered through the streets , lit by vari - coloured lanterns , looking on at the dancers , who were executing skilful steps and boundings , and the astrologers who stood in the open air with their telescopes . then he came to the harbour , which was lit up by the resin torches of the fishermen , who were fishing from their boats .",1
"the worthy mercer had , immediately upon re - entering his house , informed his wife of his happy return , and his wife had replied by congratulating him , and telling him that the first moment she could steal from her duties should be devoted to paying him a visit .",1
"my heart really warmed to the worthy lady as i heard her talk ; and i drew my chair a little nearer to her , and expressed my sincere wish that she might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated .",6
"the host replied that he had no other worthy of their excellencies ; but the travelers declared they would sleep in the common chamber , each on a mattress which might be thrown upon the ground .",8
"what happened when the pilot - boat came in sight of shanghai will be easily guessed . the signals made by the tankadere had been seen by the captain of the yokohama steamer , who , espying the flag at half - mast , had directed his course towards the little craft . phileas fogg , after paying the stipulated price of his passage to john busby , and rewarding that worthy with the additional sum of five hundred and fifty pounds , ascended the steamer with aouda and fix ; and they started at once for nagasaki and yokohama .",71
"passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie . up to his arrival at bombay , he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there ; but , now that they were plainly whirling across india at full speed , a sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams . his old vagabond nature returned to him ; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took possession of him . he came to regard his master 's project as intended in good earnest , believed in the reality of the bet , and therefore in the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail within the designated period . already he began to worry about possible delays , and accidents which might happen on the way . he recognised himself as being personally interested in the wager , and trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable folly of the night before . being much less cool - headed than mr . fogg , he was much more restless , counting and recounting the days passed over , uttering maledictions when the train stopped , and accusing it of sluggishness , and mentally blaming mr . fogg for not having bribed the engineer . the worthy fellow was ignorant that , while it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer , it could not be done on the railway .",221
"there once more , through the panels opening into these caribbean waters ten meters below the surface of the waves , i found so many fascinating exhibits to describe in my daily notes ! among other zoophytes there were portuguese men - of - war known by the name physalia pelagica , like big , oblong bladders with a pearly sheen , spreading their membranes to the wind , letting their blue tentacles drift like silken threads ; to the eye delightful jellyfish , to the touch actual nettles that ooze a corrosive liquid . among the articulates there were annelid worms one and a half meters long , furnished with a pink proboscis , equipped with 1,700 organs of locomotion , snaking through the waters , and as they went , throwing off every gleam in the solar spectrum . from the fish branch there were manta rays , enormous cartilaginous fish ten feet long and weighing 600 pounds , their pectoral fin triangular , their midback slightly arched , their eyes attached to the edges of the face at the front of the head ; they floated like wreckage from a ship , sometimes fastening onto our windows like opaque shutters . there were american triggerfish for which nature has ground only black and white pigments , feather - shaped gobies that were long and plump with yellow fins and jutting jaws , sixteen - decimeter mackerel with short , sharp teeth , covered with small scales , and related to the albacore species . next came swarms of red mullet corseted in gold stripes from head to tail , their shining fins all aquiver , genuine masterpieces of jewelry , formerly sacred to the goddess diana , much in demand by rich romans , and about which the old saying goes : "" he who catches them does n't eat them ! "" finally , adorned with emerald ribbons and dressed in velvet and silk , golden angelfish passed before our eyes like courtiers in the paintings of veronese ; spurred gilthead stole by with their swift thoracic fins ; thread herring fifteen inches long were wrapped in their phosphorescent glimmers ; gray mullet thrashed the sea with their big fleshy tails ; red salmon seemed to mow the waves with their slicing pectorals ; and silver moonfish , worthy of their name , rose on the horizon of the waters like the whitish reflections of many moons .",392
"certainly , this man , whoever he was , might expect a somewhat too energetic embrace from the worthy pencroft !",18
"and you say in his leisure moments the worthy man was a poacher ? """,8
"at any rate the guilty man felt remorse , he repented , and his new friends would have cordially pressed the hand which they sought ; but he did not feel himself worthy to extend it to honest men !",32
"the worthy indian then gave some account of the victim , who , he said , was a celebrated beauty of the parsee race , and the daughter of a wealthy bombay merchant . she had received a thoroughly english education in that city , and , from her manners and intelligence , would be thought an european . her name was aouda . left an orphan , she was married against her will to the old rajah of bundelcund ; and , knowing the fate that awaited her , she escaped , was retaken , and devoted by the rajah 's relatives , who had an interest in her death , to the sacrifice from which it seemed she could not escape .",1
""" all right , herbert , and on that day our worthy companion will have nothing left to wish for in this world . """,11
"while the worthy frenchman was absorbed in the state of the sky and the depression of the temperature , aouda was experiencing fears from a totally different cause .",2
"passepartout was dispatched in search of the steward , and soon returned with two packs of cards , some pins , counters , and a shelf covered with cloth . the game commenced . aouda understood whist sufficiently well , and even received some compliments on her playing from mr . fogg . as for the detective , he was simply an adept , and worthy of being matched against his present opponent .",65
"how strange a chequer - work of providence is the life of man ! and by what secret different springs are the affections hurried about , as different circumstances present ! to - day we love what to - morrow we hate ; to - day we seek what to - morrow we shun ; to - day we desire what to - morrow we fear , nay , even tremble at the apprehensions of . this was exemplified in me , at this time , in the most lively manner imaginable ; for i , whose only affliction was that i seemed banished from human society , that i was alone , circumscribed by the boundless ocean , cut off from mankind , and condemned to what i call silent life ; that i was as one whom heaven thought not worthy to be numbered among the living , or to appear among the rest of his creatures ; that to have seen one of my own species would have seemed to me a raising me from death to life , and the greatest blessing that heaven itself , next to the supreme blessing of salvation , could bestow ; i say , that i should now tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a man , and was ready to sink into the ground at but the shadow or silent appearance of a man having set his foot in the island .",142
"what was detective fix , so unluckily drawn on from country to country , doing all this while ? he had managed to embark on the rangoon at calcutta without being seen by passepartout , after leaving orders that , if the warrant should arrive , it should be forwarded to him at hong kong ; and he hoped to conceal his presence to the end of the voyage . it would have been difficult to explain why he was on board without awakening passepartout 's suspicions , who thought him still at bombay . but necessity impelled him , nevertheless , to renew his acquaintance with the worthy servant , as will be seen .",108
