""" you 're mighty close about this affair , mr . holmes . what 's the game now ? """,16
""" a waiting game . """,3
the hunters were tempted by the aquatic game which took up their winter quarters there .,7
""" no , "" i heard her say : "" she looks too stupid for any game of the sort . "" ere long a bell tinkled , and the curtain drew up .",16
""" yes , professor , the sea supplies all my needs . sometimes i cast my nets in our wake , and i pull them up ready to burst . sometimes i go hunting right in the midst of this element that has long seemed so far out of man 's reach , and i corner the game that dwells in my underwater forests . like the flocks of old proteus , king neptune 's shepherd , my herds graze without fear on the ocean 's immense prairies . there i own vast properties that i harvest myself , and which are forever sown by the hand of the creator of all things . """,57
""" sir , i understand perfectly how your nets can furnish excellent fish for your table ; i understand less how you can chase aquatic game in your underwater forests ; but how a piece of red meat , no matter how small , can figure in your menu , that i do n't understand at all . """,25
""" it 's absurd ! "" cried stuart , who was beginning to be annoyed at the persistency of his friend . "" come , let 's go on with the game . """,31
""" exactly . he retained it in his hand after using it to set the hound upon the track . he fled when he knew the game was up , still clutching it . and he hurled it away at this point of his flight . we know at least that he came so far in safety . """,26
"in the evening the hunters returned , having enjoyed good sport , and being literally loaded with game ; indeed , they had as much as four men could possibly carry .",17
""" well ! i would soon make a bow and arrows , and then there could be plenty of game in the larder ! """,19
"the dwelling was filled with appetizing odors , which were emitted from the learned manipulation of neb and the reporter . but all the results of the chase were not made into preserved provisions ; and as the game kept perfectly in the intense cold , wild duck and other fowl were eaten fresh , and declared superior to all other aquatic birds in the known world .",38
""" you see , my friend , it 's an issue of the monster , the notorious narwhale . we 're going to rid the seas of it ! the author of a two - volume work , in quarto , on the mysteries of the great ocean depths has no excuse for not setting sail with commander farragut . it 's a glorious mission but also a dangerous one ! we do n't know where it will take us ! these beasts can be quite unpredictable ! but we 're going just the same ! we have a commander who 's game for anything !

""" then i dare n't delay , "" conseil replied . "" the hunt is on ! we absolutely must bag some game to placate this man - eater , or one of these mornings master wo n't find enough pieces of his manservant to serve him . """,22
"agouties , peccaries , capybaras , kangaroos , game of all sorts , actually swarmed there , and spilett and herbert were too good marksmen ever to throw away their shot uselessly .",8
this strange and sonorous cry was produced by a game bird called grouse in the united states .,9
""" dear me ! it is a stake for which a man might well play a desperate game . and one more question , dr . mortimer . supposing that anything happened to our young friend here -- you will forgive the unpleasant hypothesis!--who would inherit the estate ? """,17
"the colonists had paid visits also to the oyster bed , the warren , the coal and iron mines , and to the till then unexplored districts of the far west forest , which abounded in game .",36
"then she knew that he was one of the friends of m. de treville , and consequently , that he belonged body and soul to the king ; which would make him lose a part of his advantage , since when known to milady as he knew her , he played only an equal game with her .",54
"but i stayed out a few minutes longer with adele and pilot -- ran a race with her , and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock .",22
"seven months ago , when we landed on the island , you would have been only too glad to have met with such game ! """,23
"the worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat as hearty a breakfast as possible before leaving the carnatic ; but , as he had been walking about all day , the demands of hunger were becoming importunate . he observed that the butchers stalls contained neither mutton , goat , nor pork ; and , knowing also that it is a sacrilege to kill cattle , which are preserved solely for farming , he made up his mind that meat was far from plentiful in yokohama -- nor was he mistaken ; and , in default of butcher 's meat , he could have wished for a quarter of wild boar or deer , a partridge , or some quails , some game or fish , which , with rice , the japanese eat almost exclusively . but he found it necessary to keep up a stout heart , and to postpone the meal he craved till the following morning . night came , and passepartout re - entered the native quarter , where he wandered through the streets , lit by vari - coloured lanterns , looking on at the dancers , who were executing skilful steps and boundings , and the astrologers who stood in the open air with their telescopes . then he came to the harbour , which was lit up by the resin torches of the fishermen , who were fishing from their boats .",124
"but , if he thought of these possibilities , he did not betray the fact by any outward sign . always the same impassible member of the reform club , whom no incident could surprise , as unvarying as the ship 's chronometers , and seldom having the curiosity even to go upon the deck , he passed through the memorable scenes of the red sea with cold indifference ; did not care to recognise the historic towns and villages which , along its borders , raised their picturesque outlines against the sky ; and betrayed no fear of the dangers of the arabic gulf , which the old historians always spoke of with horror , and upon which the ancient navigators never ventured without propitiating the gods by ample sacrifices . how did this eccentric personage pass his time on the mongolia ? he made his four hearty meals every day , regardless of the most persistent rolling and pitching on the part of the steamer ; and he played whist indefatigably , for he had found partners as enthusiastic in the game as himself .",183
"then only d’artagnan remembered the languishing glances of kitty , her constantly meeting him in the antechamber , the corridor , or on the stairs , those touches of the hand every time she met him , and her deep sighs ; but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady , he had disdained the soubrette . he whose game is the eagle takes no heed of the sparrow .",61
"the game constituted the only dish at supper ; the meat was excellent , and pencroft and herbert , whose long excursion had rendered them very hungry , devoured it with infinite satisfaction .",1
"one minute more , and the wager would be won . andrew stuart and his partners suspended their game . they left their cards , and counted the seconds .",18
"i understand my game , kitty ; i have this one safe . """,3
"the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo : she succeeded in getting its body tucked away , comfortably enough , under her arm , with its legs hanging down , but generally , just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out , and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head , it would twist itself round and look up in her face , with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing : and when she had got its head down , and was going to begin again , it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself , and was in the act of crawling away : besides all this , there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to , and , as the doubled - up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground , alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed .",183
"the same day an odd fishing practice further increased the nautilus 's stores , so full of game were these seas . our trawl brought up in its meshes a number of fish whose heads were topped by little oval slabs with fleshy edges . these were suckerfish from the third family of the subbrachian malacopterygia . these flat disks on their heads consist of crosswise plates of movable cartilage , between which the animals can create a vacuum , enabling them to stick to objects like suction cups .",17
"alice waited till the eyes appeared , and then nodded . ' it 's no use speaking to it , ' she thought , ' till its ears have come , or at least one of them . ' in another minute the whole head appeared , and then alice put down her flamingo , and began an account of the game , feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her . the cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight , and no more of it appeared .",61
"the stronger among the girls ran about and engaged in active games , but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for shelter and warmth in the verandah ; and amongst these , as the dense mist penetrated to their shivering frames , i heard frequently the sound of a hollow cough .",11
"as the hour to wait upon the king was not till twelve , he had made a party with porthos and aramis to play a game at tennis in a tennis court situated near the stables of the luxembourg .",25
"d’artagnan remained , therefore , alone ; and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play it regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without counting .",17
""" you have given me a thrashing , "" said fix . "" good , i expected it . now , listen to me . up to this time i have been mr . fogg 's adversary . i am now in his game . """,43
"certainly , the former savage of tabor island could not be perplexed how to live in the forest , abounding in game , but was it not to be feared that he had resumed his habits , and that this freedom would revive in him his wild instincts ?",21
"you are in love with a woman whom the cardinal has caused to be shut up , and you wish to get her out of the hands of the cardinal . that ’s a match you are playing with his eminence ; this letter is your game .",46
why should you expose your game to your adversary ? that is never done .,5
""" yes , sometimes , "" the captain replied . "" these animals have been known to turn on their assailants and capsize their longboats . but with mr . land that danger is n't to be feared . his eye is sharp , his arm is sure . if i recommend that he aim carefully at this dugong , it 's because the animal is justly regarded as fine game , and i know mr . land does n't despise a choice morsel .

"from school duties she was exonerated : mrs . fairfax had pressed me into her service , and i was all day in the storeroom , helping ( or hindering ) her and the cook ; learning to make custards and cheese - cakes and french pastry , to truss game and garnish desert - dishes .",50

"she made her brother talk of himself , his hopes , his prospects . he spoke slowly and with effort . they passed words to each other as players at a game pass counters . sibyl felt oppressed . she could not communicate her joy . a faint smile curving that sullen mouth was all the echo she could win . after some time she became silent . suddenly she caught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing lips , and in an open carriage with two ladies dorian gray drove past .",31
"at a depth of ten meters , we walked amid a swarm of small fish from every species , more numerous than birds in the air , more agile too ; but no aquatic game worthy of a gunshot had yet been offered to our eyes .",34
"top , whose share had been very much to his taste , would know how to find some fresh game among the brushwood .",19
"he began to reassure aouda , telling her that blusterers were never to be feared , and begged fix to be his second at the approaching duel , a request which the detective could not refuse . mr . fogg resumed the interrupted game with perfect calmness .",43
"for some days we saw a large number of aquatic birds with webbed feet , known as gulls or sea mews . some were skillfully slain , and when cooked in a certain fashion , they make a very acceptable platter of water game . among the great wind riders -- carried over long distances from every shore and resting on the waves from their exhausting flights-- i spotted some magnificent albatross , birds belonging to the longipennes ( long - winged ) family , whose discordant calls sound like the braying of an ass . the totipalmes ( fully webbed ) family was represented by swift frigate birds , nimbly catching fish at the surface , and by numerous tropic birds of the genus phaeton , among others the red - tailed tropic bird , the size of a pigeon , its white plumage shaded with pink tints that contrasted with its dark - hued wings .",43
