"on leaving rejkiavik hans took us by the seashore . we passed lean pastures which were trying very hard , but in vain , to look green ; yellow came out best . the rugged peaks of the trachyte rocks presented faint outlines on the eastern horizon ; at times a few patches of snow , concentrating the vague light , glittered upon the slopes of the distant mountains ; certain peaks , boldly uprising , passed through the grey clouds , and reappeared above the moving mists , like breakers emerging in the heavens .",68
"we had long lost sight of the sea shore behind the hills of bones . the rash professor , careless of losing his way , hurried me forward . we advanced in silence , bathed in luminous electric fluid . by some phenomenon which i am unable to explain , it lighted up all sides of every object equally . such was its diffusiveness , there being no central point from which the light emanated , that shadows no longer existed . you might have thought yourself under the rays of a vertical sun in a tropical region at noonday and the height of summer . no vapour was visible . the rocks , the distant mountains , a few isolated clumps of forest trees in the distance , presented a weird and wonderful aspect under these totally new conditions of a universal diffusion of light . we were like hoffmann 's shadowless man .",116
"by nine o'clock we had pulled up to shore . the sky was growing brighter . clouds were fleeing to the south . mists were rising from the cold surface of the water . captain nemo headed toward the peak , which he no doubt planned to make his observatory . it was an arduous climb over sharp lava and pumice stones in the midst of air often reeking with sulfurous fumes from the smoke holes . for a man out of practice at treading land , the captain scaled the steepest slopes with a supple agility i could n't equal , and which would have been envied by hunters of pyrenees mountain goats .",112
""" jane is not such a weakling as you would make her , "" he would say : "" she can bear a mountain blast , or a shower , or a few flakes of snow , as well as any of us . her constitution is both sound and elastic;--better calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust . """,23
"candide and cacambo were placed on this machine , and they took with them two large red sheep , bridled and saddled , to ride upon , when they got on the other side of the mountains ; twenty others to serve as sumpters for carrying provisions ; thirty laden with presents of whatever was most curious in the country , and fifty with gold , diamonds , and other precious stones .",36
"prince dakkar , unable to find that death he courted , returned to the mountain fastnesses of bundelkund .",14
"we had no time to watch these phenomena ; we had to proceed on our way . soon at the foot of the mountains the boggy land reappeared , intersected by little lakes . our route now lay westward ; we had turned the great bay of faxa , and the twin peaks of snæfell rose white into the cloudy sky at the distance of at least five miles .",23
"papua is 400 leagues long by 130 leagues wide , with a surface area of 40,000 geographic leagues . it 's located between latitude 0 degrees 19 ' and 10 degrees 2 ' south , and between longitude 128 degrees 23 ' and 146 degrees 15 ' . at noon , while the chief officer was taking the sun 's altitude , i spotted the summits of the arfak mountains , rising in terraces and ending in sharp peaks .",69
"snæfell is 5,000 feet high . its double cone forms the limit of a trachytic belt which stands out distinctly in the mountain system of the island . from our starting point we could see the two peaks boldly projected against the dark grey sky ; i could see an enormous cap of snow coming low down upon the giant 's brow .",22
"but at a later period a wide chasm formed diagonally from south - west to north - east , through which was gradually forced out the trachyte which was to form a mountain chain . no violence accompanied this change ; the matter thrown out was in vast quantities , and the liquid material oozing out from the abysses of the earth slowly spread in extensive plains or in hillocky masses . to this period belong the felspar , syenites , and porphyries .",32
"after the exhaustion of the basalt , the volcano , the power of which grew by the extinction of the lesser craters , supplied an egress to lava , ashes , and scoriae , of which i could see lengthened screes streaming down the sides of the mountain like flowing hair .",47
"to judge by the distant appearance of the summit of snæfell , it would have seemed too steep to ascend on our side . fortunately , after an hour of fatigue and athletic exercises , in the midst of the vast surface of snow presented by the hollow between the two peaks , a kind of staircase appeared unexpectedly which greatly facilitated our ascent . it was formed by one of those torrents of stones flung up by the eruptions , called ' sting ' by the icelanders . if this torrent had not been arrested in its fall by the formation of the sides of the mountain , it would have gone on to the sea and formed more islands .",107
"and i too could feel the difference created by the water 's powerful density -- despite my heavy clothing , copper headpiece , and metal soles , i climbed the most impossibly steep gradients with all the nimbleness , i swear it , of a chamois or a pyrenees mountain goat !",49
"two hours after leaving the nautilus , we had cleared the timberline , and 100 feet above our heads stood the mountain peak , forming a dark silhouette against the brilliant glare that came from its far slope . petrified shrubs rambled here and there in sprawling zigzags . fish rose in a body at our feet like birds startled in tall grass . the rocky mass was gouged with impenetrable crevices , deep caves , unfathomable holes at whose far ends i could hear fearsome things moving around . my blood would curdle as i watched some enormous antenna bar my path , or saw some frightful pincer snap shut in the shadow of some cavity ! a thousand specks of light glittered in the midst of the gloom . they were the eyes of gigantic crustaceans crouching in their lairs , giant lobsters rearing up like spear carriers and moving their claws with a scrap - iron clanking , titanic crabs aiming their bodies like cannons on their carriages , and hideous devilfish intertwining their tentacles like bushes of writhing snakes .",21
"passepartout 's visage darkened with the skies , and for two days the poor fellow experienced constant fright . but phileas fogg was a bold mariner , and knew how to maintain headway against the sea ; and he kept on his course , without even decreasing his steam . the henrietta , when she could not rise upon the waves , crossed them , swamping her deck , but passing safely . sometimes the screw rose out of the water , beating its protruding end , when a mountain of water raised the stern above the waves ; but the craft always kept straight ahead .",89
"oh , why was i so short of time ! i would have gone down the steep slopes of this mountain , crossed this entire immense continent , which surely connects africa with america , and visited its great prehistoric cities . under my eyes there perhaps lay the warlike town of makhimos or the pious village of eusebes , whose gigantic inhabitants lived for whole centuries and had the strength to raise blocks of stone that still withstood the action of the waters . one day perhaps , some volcanic phenomenon will bring these sunken ruins back to the surface of the waves ! numerous underwater volcanoes have been sighted in this part of the ocean , and many ships have felt terrific tremors when passing over these turbulent depths . a few have heard hollow noises that announced some struggle of the elements far below , others have hauled in volcanic ash hurled above the waves . as far as the equator this whole seafloor is still under construction by plutonic forces . and in some remote epoch , built up by volcanic disgorgings and successive layers of lava , who knows whether the peaks of these fire - belching mountains may reappear above the surface of the atlantic !",202
"at an elevation of about thirty meters , the nature of the terrain changed without becoming any easier . pudding stones and trachyte gave way to black basaltic rock : here , lying in slabs all swollen with blisters ; there , shaped like actual prisms and arranged into a series of columns that supported the springings of this immense vault , a wonderful sample of natural architecture . then , among this basaltic rock , there snaked long , hardened lava flows inlaid with veins of bituminous coal and in places covered by wide carpets of sulfur . the sunshine coming through the crater had grown stronger , shedding a hazy light over all the volcanic waste forever buried in the heart of this extinct mountain .",126
"on leaving the forest , the mountain system of the country appeared before the explorers .",6

""" yes ; the number of active volcanoes on the surface of the globe is at the present time only about three hundred . but there is a very much larger number of extinct ones . now , snæfell is one of these . since historic times there has been but one eruption of this mountain , that of 1219 ; from that time it has quieted down more and more , and now it is no longer reckoned among active volcanoes . """,55
"the next day , april 1 , when the nautilus rose to the surface of the waves a few minutes before noon , we raised land to the west . it was tierra del fuego , the land of fire , a name given it by early navigators after they saw numerous curls of smoke rising from the natives ' huts . this land of fire forms a huge cluster of islands over thirty leagues long and eighty leagues wide , extending between latitude 53 degrees and 56 degrees south , and between longitude 67 degrees 50 ' and 77 degrees 15 ' west . its coastline looked flat , but high mountains rose in the distance . i even thought i glimpsed mt . sarmiento , whose elevation is 2,070 meters above sea level : a pyramid - shaped block of shale with a very sharp summit , which , depending on whether it 's clear or veiled in vapor , "" predicts fair weather or foul , "" as ned land told me .",112
"in the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the sierra blanco . as far as the eye can reach stretches the great flat plain - land , all dusted over with patches of alkali , and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes . on the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks , with their rugged summits flecked with snow . in this great stretch of country there is no sign of life , nor of anything appertaining to life . there is no bird in the steel - blue heaven , no movement upon the dull , grey earth — above all , there is absolute silence . listen as one may , there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness ; nothing but silence — complete and heart - subduing silence . it has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain . that is hardly true . looking down from the sierra blanco , one sees a pathway traced out across the desert , which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance . it is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers . here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun , and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali . approach , and examine them ! they are bones : some large and coarse , others smaller and more delicate . the former have belonged to oxen , and the latter to men . for fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside .",67
"the train entered the defiles of the sutpour mountains , which separate the khandeish from bundelcund , towards evening . the next day sir francis cromarty asked passepartout what time it was ; to which , on consulting his watch , he replied that it was three in the morning . this famous timepiece , always regulated on the greenwich meridian , which was now some seventy - seven degrees westward , was at least four hours slow . sir francis corrected passepartout 's time , whereupon the latter made the same remark that he had done to fix ; and upon the general insisting that the watch should be regulated in each new meridian , since he was constantly going eastward , that is in the face of the sun , and therefore the days were shorter by four minutes for each degree gone over , passepartout obstinately refused to alter his watch , which he kept at london time . it was an innocent delusion which could harm no one .",8
"once or twice in the daytime i thought i saw the pico of teneriffe , being the high top of the mountain teneriffe in the canaries , and had a great mind to venture out , in hopes of reaching thither ; but having tried twice , i was forced in again by contrary winds , the sea also going too high for my little vessel ; so , i resolved to pursue my first design , and keep along the shore .",21

"the young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion , and his dark eyes sparkled with pleasure . "" i 'll do so , "" he said , "" we 've been in the mountains for two months , and are not over and above in visiting condition . he must take us as he finds us . """,33
"in order to shorten the journey , the guide passed to the left of the line where the railway was still in process of being built . this line , owing to the capricious turnings of the vindhia mountains , did not pursue a straight course . the parsee , who was quite familiar with the roads and paths in the district , declared that they would gain twenty miles by striking directly through the forest .",38
"two hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me . the raft was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again , at a distance of twenty fathoms .",17
""" you can not now wonder , "" continued my master , "" that when you rose upon me so unexpectedly last night , i had difficulty in believing you any other than a mere voice and vision , something that would melt to silence and annihilation , as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted before . now , i thank god ! i know it to be otherwise .",53
"it was on this side that , at the time when the mountain was in a state of eruption , the discharge had worn away a passage , and a large heap of lava had spread to the narrow jaw which formed the northeastern gulf .",12
"on the morning which followed his interview with the mormon prophet , john ferrier went in to salt lake city , and having found his acquaintance , who was bound for the nevada mountains , he entrusted him with his message to jefferson hope . in it he told the young man of the imminent danger which threatened them , and how necessary it was that he should return . having done thus he felt easier in his mind , and returned home with a lighter heart .",33
"the exploration of the island was finished , its shape determined , its features made out , its extent calculated , the water and mountain systems ascertained .",24
""" we must make our start at once , "" said jefferson hope , speaking in a low but resolute voice , like one who realizes the greatness of the peril , but has steeled his heart to meet it .

"at eleven in the morning the train had reached the dividing ridge of the waters at bridger pass , seven thousand five hundred and twenty - four feet above the level of the sea , one of the highest points attained by the track in crossing the rocky mountains . after going about two hundred miles , the travellers at last found themselves on one of those vast plains which extend to the atlantic , and which nature has made so propitious for laying the iron road .",48
"on the declivity of the atlantic basin the first streams , branches of the north platte river , already appeared . the whole northern and eastern horizon was bounded by the immense semi - circular curtain which is formed by the southern portion of the rocky mountains , the highest being laramie peak . between this and the railway extended vast plains , plentifully irrigated . on the right rose the lower spurs of the mountainous mass which extends southward to the sources of the arkansas river , one of the great tributaries of the missouri .",46

"on november 26 , at three o'clock in the morning , the nautilus cleared the tropic of cancer at longitude 172 degrees . on the 27th it passed in sight of the hawaiian islands , where the famous captain cook met his death on february 14 , 1779 . by then we had fared 4,860 leagues from our starting point . when i arrived on the platform that morning , i saw the island of hawaii two miles to leeward , the largest of the seven islands making up this group . i could clearly distinguish the tilled soil on its outskirts , the various mountain chains running parallel with its coastline , and its volcanoes , crowned by mauna kea , whose elevation is 5,000 meters above sea level . among other specimens from these waterways , our nets brought up some peacock - tailed flabellarian coral , polyps flattened into stylish shapes and unique to this part of the ocean .",105
"while cruising along only a few cable lengths from the underpinning of reao island , i marveled at the gigantic piece of work accomplished by these microscopic laborers . these walls were the express achievements of madrepores known by the names fire coral , finger coral , star coral , and stony coral . these polyps grow exclusively in the agitated strata at the surface of the sea , and so it 's in the upper reaches that they begin these substructures , which sink little by little together with the secreted rubble binding them . this , at least , is the theory of mr . charles darwin , who thus explains the formation of atolls -- a theory superior , in my view , to the one that says these madreporic edifices sit on the summits of mountains or volcanoes submerged a few feet below sea level .",139
