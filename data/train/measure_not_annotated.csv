"in the northeast there emerged two volcanic islands of unequal size , surrounded by a coral reef whose circuit measured forty miles . we were facing the island of vanikoro proper , to which captain dumont d'urville had given the name "" island of the search "" ; we lay right in front of the little harbor of vana , located in latitude 16 degrees 4 ' south and longitude 164 degrees 32 ' east . its shores seemed covered with greenery from its beaches to its summits inland , crowned by mt . kapogo , which is 476 fathoms high .",19
"now in mineralogy there are many half - greek and half - latin terms , very hard to articulate , and which would be most trying to a poet 's measures . i do n't wish to say a word against so respectable a science , far be that from me . true , in the august presence of rhombohedral crystals , retinasphaltic resins , gehlenites , fassaites , molybdenites , tungstates of manganese , and titanite of zirconium , why , the most facile of tongues may make a slip now and then .",30

even pencroft lost in some measure the somber taciturnity occasioned by the devastation and ruin of his domain .,5
"after the works of art , natural rarities predominated . they consisted chiefly of plants , shells , and other exhibits from the ocean that must have been captain nemo 's own personal finds . in the middle of the lounge , a jet of water , electrically lit , fell back into a basin made from a single giant clam . the delicately festooned rim of this shell , supplied by the biggest mollusk in the class acephala , measured about six meters in circumference ; so it was even bigger than those fine giant clams given to king françois i by the republic of venice , and which the church of saint - sulpice in paris has made into two gigantic holy - water fonts .",80
"after we had passed the basaltic wall of the fiord of stapi we passed over a vegetable fibrous peat bog , left from the ancient vegetation of this peninsula . the vast quantity of this unworked fuel would be sufficient to warm the whole population of iceland for a century ; this vast turbary measured in certain ravines had in many places a depth of seventy feet , and presented layers of carbonized remains of vegetation alternating with thinner layers of tufaceous pumice .",54
""" sir , "" captain nemo said , showing me the instruments hanging on the walls of his stateroom , "" these are the devices needed to navigate the nautilus . here , as in the lounge , i always have them before my eyes , and they indicate my position and exact heading in the midst of the ocean . you 're familiar with some of them , such as the thermometer , which gives the temperature inside the nautilus ; the barometer , which measures the heaviness of the outside air and forecasts changes in the weather ; the humidistat , which indicates the degree of dryness in the atmosphere ; the storm glass , whose mixture decomposes to foretell the arrival of tempests ; the compass , which steers my course ; the sextant , which takes the sun 's altitude and tells me my latitude ; chronometers , which allow me to calculate my longitude ; and finally , spyglasses for both day and night , enabling me to scrutinize every point of the horizon once the nautilus has risen to the surface of the waves .

"yet hans did not think it prudent to spend the night upon the sides of the cone . we continued our zigzag climb . the fifteen hundred remaining feet took us five hours to clear ; the circuitous route , the diagonal and the counter marches , must have measured at least three leagues . i could stand it no longer . i was yielding to the effects of hunger and cold . the rarefied air scarcely gave play to the action of my lungs .",49
"suddenly , after a space of time that i could not measure , i felt a shock . the raft had not struck against any hard resistance , but had suddenly been checked in its fall . a waterspout , an immense liquid column , was beating upon the surface of the waters . i was suffocating ! i was drowning !",11

"the shellfish meleagrina , that womb for pearls whose valves are nearly equal in size , has the shape of a round shell with thick walls and a very rough exterior . some of these shells were furrowed with flaky , greenish bands that radiated down from the top . these were the young oysters . the others had rugged black surfaces , measured up to fifteen centimeters in width , and were ten or more years old .",63

"brightly lit , the engine room measured at least 20 meters in length . it was divided , by function , into two parts : the first contained the cells for generating electricity , the second that mechanism transmitting movement to the propeller .",6
"this stream of electricity dazzled my eyes , and after momentarily shutting them , i looked around . the nautilus was stationary . it was floating next to an embankment shaped like a wharf . as for the water now buoying the ship , it was a lake completely encircled by an inner wall about two miles in diameter , hence six miles around . its level -- as indicated by the pressure gauge -- would be the same as the outside level , because some connection had to exist between this lake and the sea . slanting inward over their base , these high walls converged to form a vault shaped like an immense upside - down funnel that measured 500 or 600 meters in height . at its summit there gaped the circular opening through which i had detected that faint glimmer , obviously daylight .",120

"a sandy beach unfolded before us , measuring 500 feet at its widest point between the waters of the lake and the foot of the mountain 's walls . via this strand you could easily circle the lake . but the base of these high walls consisted of broken soil over which there lay picturesque piles of volcanic blocks and enormous pumice stones . all these crumbling masses were covered with an enamel polished by the action of underground fires , and they glistened under the stream of electric light from our beacon . stirred up by our footsteps , the mica - rich dust on this beach flew into the air like a cloud of sparks .",7
it was now necessary to complete the observations of the evening before by measuring the height of the cliff above the level of the sea .,13
""" just so , herbert , "" replied the engineer ; "" and when we have measured the two first distances , knowing the height of the pole , we shall only have a sum in proportion to do , which will give us the height of the cliff , and will save us the trouble of measuring it directly . """,57
5000 / 15 = 333.3 from which it was proved that the granite cliff measured 333 feet in height .,14

"following the plan proposed by cyrus harding , the space was to be divided into five compartments looking out on the sea ; to the right , an entry with a door , which would meet the ladder ; then a kitchen , thirty feet long ; a dining - room , measuring forty feet ; a sleeping - room , of equal size ; and lastly , a "" visitor 's room , "" petitioned for by pencroft , and which was next to the great hall .",52

"this measure was distasteful to me . to my mind it would lead nowhere . we could hope for nothing from the nautilus 's commander but could depend only on ourselves . besides , for some time now the man had been gloomier , more withdrawn , less sociable . he seemed to be avoiding me . i encountered him only at rare intervals . he used to take pleasure in explaining the underwater wonders to me ; now he left me to my research and no longer entered the lounge .",1
"so i begged ned to let me think about it before taking action . if this measure proved fruitless , it could arouse the captain 's suspicions , make our circumstances even more arduous , and jeopardize the canadian 's plans . i might add that i could hardly use our state of health as an argument . except for that grueling ordeal under the ice bank at the south pole , we had never felt better , neither ned , conseil , nor i. the nutritious food , life - giving air , regular routine , and uniform temperature kept illness at bay ; and for a man who did n't miss his past existence on land , for a captain nemo who was at home here , who went where he wished , who took paths mysterious to others if not himself in attaining his ends , i could understand such a life . but we ourselves had n't severed all ties with humanity . for my part , i did n't want my new and unusual research to be buried with my bones . i had now earned the right to pen the definitive book on the sea , and sooner or later i wanted that book to see the light of day .",16

"i was in some degree settled in my measures for carrying on the plantation before my kind friend , the captain of the ship that took me up at sea , went back — for the ship remained there , in providing his lading and preparing for his voyage , nearly three months — when telling him what little stock i had left behind me in london , he gave me this friendly and sincere advice:—“seignior inglese , ” says he ( for so he always called me ) , “ if you will give me letters , and a procuration in form to me , with orders to the person who has your money in london to send your effects to lisbon , to such persons as i shall direct , and in such goods as are proper for this country , i will bring you the produce of them , god willing , at my return ; but , since human affairs are all subject to changes and disasters , i would have you give orders but for one hundred pounds sterling , which , you say , is half your stock , and let the hazard be run for the first ; so that , if it come safe , you may order the rest the same way , and , if it miscarry , you may have the other half to have recourse to for your supply . ”",8

"in an hour we had reached the islet . two hours later we had completed a full circle around it . it measured four to five miles in circumference . a narrow channel separated it from a considerable shore , perhaps a continent whose limits we could n't see . the existence of this shore seemed to bear out commander maury 's hypotheses . in essence , this ingenious american has noted that between the south pole and the 60th parallel , the sea is covered with floating ice of dimensions much greater than any found in the north atlantic . from this fact he drew the conclusion that the antarctic circle must contain considerable shores , since icebergs ca n't form on the high seas but only along coastlines . according to his calculations , this frozen mass enclosing the southernmost pole forms a vast ice cap whose width must reach 4,000 kilometers .",22
