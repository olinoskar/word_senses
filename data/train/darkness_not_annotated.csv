""" he must have been holding it as a signal , "" said i. "" let us see if there is any answer . "" i held it as he had done , and stared out into the darkness of the night . vaguely i could discern the black bank of the trees and the lighter expanse of the moor , for the moon was behind the clouds . and then i gave a cry of exultation , for a tiny pin - point of yellow light had suddenly transfixed the dark veil , and glowed steadily in the centre of the black square framed by the window .",38
i retraced my steps . i walked for a quarter of an hour . i gazed into the darkness . i shouted . no reply : my voice was lost in the midst of the cavernous echoes which alone replied to my call .,18
"as if in reply to the sailor 's observation , a bright light flashed in the darkness , and a cannon - shot was heard .",16
"as if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast gloom of the moor that strange cry which i had already heard upon the borders of the great grimpen mire . it came with the wind through the silence of the night , a long , deep mutter , then a rising howl , and then the sad moan in which it died away . again and again it sounded , the whole air throbbing with it , strident , wild , and menacing . the baronet caught my sleeve and his face glimmered white through the darkness .",101
"a terrible cry of anguish burst from me . upon earth , in the midst of the darkest night , light never abdicates its functions altogether . it is still subtle and diffusive , but whatever little there may be , the eye still catches that little . here there was not an atom ; the total darkness made me totally blind .",57
""" a dog ! "" said holmes . "" by jove , a curly - haired spaniel . poor mortimer will never see his pet again . well , i do not know that this place contains any secret which we have not already fathomed . he could hide his hound , but he could not hush its voice , and hence came those cries which even in daylight were not pleasant to hear . on an emergency he could keep the hound in the out - house at merripit , but it was always a risk , and it was only on the supreme day , which he regarded as the end of all his efforts , that he dared do it . this paste in the tin is no doubt the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed . it was suggested , of course , by the story of the family hell - hound , and by the desire to frighten old sir charles to death . no wonder the poor devil of a convict ran and screamed , even as our friend did , and as we ourselves might have done , when he saw such a creature bounding through the darkness of the moor upon his track . it was a cunning device , for , apart from the chance of driving your victim to his death , what peasant would venture to inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight of it , as many have done , upon the moor ? i said it in london , watson , and i say it again now , that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more dangerous man than he who is lying yonder""--he swept his long arm towards the huge mottled expanse of green - splotched bog which stretched away until it merged into the russet slopes of the moor .",206
"the trees met like a bower overhead , and caused a half - darkness .",13
"when i came to myself , i was stretched in half darkness , covered with thick coats and blankets . my uncle was watching over me , to discover the least sign of life . at my first sigh he took my hand ; when i opened my eyes he uttered a cry of joy .",11

chapter xlii . headlong speed upward through the horrors of darkness,10
"after a season of darkness and struggling , light broke and relief fell : my cramped existence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds -- my powers heard a call from heaven to rise , gather their full strength , spread their wings , and mount beyond ken .",4
"athos , in his hours of gloom -- and these hours were frequent -- was extinguished as to the whole of the luminous portion of him , and his brilliant side disappeared as into profound darkness .",35
"neb , who was watching near the poultry - yard , had not hesitated to fire at one of the pirates , who was about to cross the stream ; but in the darkness he could not tell whether the man had been hit or not .",33
"and he was right . imagine the large development attained by these plants , which prefer a warm , moist climate . i knew that the _ lycopodon giganteum _ attains , according to bulliard , a circumference of eight or nine feet ; but here were pale mushrooms , thirty to forty feet high , and crowned with a cap of equal diameter . there they stood in thousands . no light could penetrate between their huge cones , and complete darkness reigned beneath those giants ; they formed settlements of domes placed in close array like the round , thatched roofs of a central african city .",82
"it was possible that something might be found here , but darkness came on , and the further exploration had to be put off to the next day .",11
"and thus , as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit , the more bitterly did i perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness , as if an inherent positive quality , poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe in one unceasing radiation of gloom .",38
"during those nineteen days just mentioned , no unique incidents distinguished our voyage . i saw little of the captain . he was at work . in the library i often found books he had left open , especially books on natural history . he had thumbed through my work on the great ocean depths , and the margins were covered with his notes , which sometimes contradicted my theories and formulations . but the captain remained content with this method of refining my work , and he rarely discussed it with me . sometimes i heard melancholy sounds reverberating from the organ , which he played very expressively , but only at night in the midst of the most secretive darkness , while the nautilus slumbered in the wilderness of the ocean .",121
this unforeseen spectacle was most charming to eyes long used to underground darkness .,12
"to - night i was to be miss miller 's bed - fellow ; she helped me to undress : when laid down i glanced at the long rows of beds , each of which was quickly filled with two occupants ; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished , and amidst silence and complete darkness i fell asleep .",56
"ned land was just pronouncing these last words when we were suddenly plunged into darkness , utter darkness . the ceiling lights went out so quickly , my eyes literally ached , just as if we had experienced the opposite sensation of going from the deepest gloom to the brightest sunlight .",14

"just then the locomotive gave a sharp screech , and the train passed out into the darkness of the night .",16
the darkness was intense .,1
"i heard a noise : the wind , i thought , shook the door . no ; it was st . john rivers , who , lifting the latch , came in out of the frozen hurricane -- the howling darkness -- and stood before me : the cloak that covered his tall figure all white as a glacier .",40
"all , towards the evening after dinner , were seated under the veranda on the edge of prospect heights , and they were watching the darkness creeping up from the horizon .",25
my mind appeared to strive in vain to shake off the heavy darkness of the sleep from which i could not rouse myself .,12
"we were alone . where ? i could n't say , could barely even imagine . all was darkness , but such utter darkness that after several minutes , my eyes were still unable to catch a single one of those hazy gleams that drift through even the blackest nights .",18
"we were alone . where ? i could n't say , could barely even imagine . all was darkness , but such utter darkness that after several minutes , my eyes were still unable to catch a single one of those hazy gleams that drift through even the blackest nights .",23
"yet in what darkness , what dense ignorance , was the mental battle fought ! i could not answer the ceaseless inward question--_why _ i thus suffered ; now , at the distance of -- i will not say how many years , i see it clearly .",3
"night came on ; the train passed on at full speed , in the midst of the roaring of the tigers , bears , and wolves which fled before the locomotive ; and the marvels of bengal , golconda ruined gour , murshedabad , the ancient capital , burdwan , hugly , and the french town of chandernagor , where passepartout would have been proud to see his country 's flag flying , were hidden from their view in the darkness .",80
"after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance , and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming . it was the white rabbit returning , splendidly dressed , with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other : he came trotting along in a great hurry , muttering to himself as he came , ' oh ! the duchess , the duchess ! oh ! wo n't she be savage if i 've kept her waiting ! ' alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one ; so , when the rabbit came near her , she began , in a low , timid voice , ' if you please , sir-- ' the rabbit started violently , dropped the white kid gloves and the fan , and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go .",154
""" at length i saw the lamp rise softly , and disappear in the depths of the ceiling ; my chamber was filled with darkness and obscurity , but i made a strong effort to penetrate this darkness and obscurity .",37
""" it was nearer one than twelve , and a wild , bleak night , blowing hard and raining in torrents . dismal as it was outside , i was glad within — so glad that i could have shouted out from pure exultation . if any of you gentlemen have ever pined for a thing , and longed for it during twenty long years , and then suddenly found it within your reach , you would understand my feelings . i lit a cigar , and puffed at it to steady my nerves , but my hands were trembling , and my temples throbbing with excitement . as i drove , i could see old john ferrier and sweet lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me , just as plain as i see you all in this room . all the way they were ahead of me , one on each side of the horse until i pulled up at the house in the brixton road .",127
"then they passed by lonely brickfields . the fog was lighter here , and he could see the strange , bottle- shaped kilns with their orange , fanlike tongues of fire . a dog barked as they went by , and far away in the darkness some wandering sea - gull screamed . the horse stumbled in a rut , then swerved aside and broke into a gallop .",45
i thought i had taken a wrong direction and lost my way . the darkness of natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me .,14
