"it was better to be with cyrus in a desert island , than without him in the most flourishing town in the united states .",19
"i consulted the map to see where gardär was . i saw there was a small town of that name on the banks of the hvalfiord , four miles from rejkiavik . i showed it to my uncle .",16
""" very true , "" said cacambo , "" but we have still two sheep remaining , with more treasure than ever the king of spain will be possessed of ; and i espy a town at a distance , which i take to be surinam , a town belonging to the dutch .",48
"as they drew near the town they saw a negro stretched on the ground with only one half of his habit , which was a kind of linen frock ; for the poor man had lost his left leg and his right hand .",5
"athos then arose from his chair , girded on his sword , enveloped himself in his cloak , and left the hotel . it was nearly ten o’clock . at ten o’clock in the evening , it is well known , the streets in provincial towns are very little frequented .",45
"meanwhile the reddish light guiding us had expanded and inflamed the horizon . the presence of this furnace under the waters had me extremely puzzled . was it some sort of electrical discharge ? was i approaching some natural phenomenon still unknown to scientists on shore ? or , rather ( and this thought did cross my mind ) , had the hand of man intervened in that blaze ? had human beings fanned those flames ? in these deep strata would i meet up with more of captain nemo 's companions , friends he was about to visit who led lives as strange as his own ? would i find a whole colony of exiles down here , men tired of the world 's woes , men who had sought and found independence in the ocean 's lower depths ? all these insane , inadmissible ideas dogged me , and in this frame of mind , continually excited by the series of wonders passing before my eyes , i would n't have been surprised to find on this sea bottom one of those underwater towns captain nemo dreamed about !",185
"i had one morsel of bread yet : the remnant of a roll i had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a stray penny -- my last coin . i saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and there , like jet beads in the heath : i gathered a handful and ate them with the bread .",18
"to say canadian is to say french , and as unsociable as ned land was , i must admit he took a definite liking to me . no doubt it was my nationality that attracted him . it was an opportunity for him to speak , and for me to hear , that old rabelaisian dialect still used in some canadian provinces . the harpooner 's family originated in quebec , and they were already a line of bold fishermen back in the days when this town still belonged to france .",86
"oh , why was i so short of time ! i would have gone down the steep slopes of this mountain , crossed this entire immense continent , which surely connects africa with america , and visited its great prehistoric cities . under my eyes there perhaps lay the warlike town of makhimos or the pious village of eusebes , whose gigantic inhabitants lived for whole centuries and had the strength to raise blocks of stone that still withstood the action of the waters . one day perhaps , some volcanic phenomenon will bring these sunken ruins back to the surface of the waves ! numerous underwater volcanoes have been sighted in this part of the ocean , and many ships have felt terrific tremors when passing over these turbulent depths . a few have heard hollow noises that announced some struggle of the elements far below , others have hauled in volcanic ash hurled above the waves . as far as the equator this whole seafloor is still under construction by plutonic forces . and in some remote epoch , built up by volcanic disgorgings and successive layers of lava , who knows whether the peaks of these fire - belching mountains may reappear above the surface of the atlantic !",50
"among those who did him the honors of the place was a little spruce abbe of perigord , one of those insinuating , busy , fawning , impudent , necessary fellows , that lay wait for strangers on their arrival , tell them all the scandal of the town , and offer to minister to their pleasures at various prices .",48
"these dates were inscribed in an itinerary divided into columns , indicating the month , the day of the month , and the day for the stipulated and actual arrivals at each principal point paris , brindisi , suez , bombay , calcutta , singapore , hong kong , yokohama , san francisco , new york , and london -- from the 2nd of october to the 21st of december ; and giving a space for setting down the gain made or the loss suffered on arrival at each locality . this methodical record thus contained an account of everything needed , and mr . fogg always knew whether he was behind - hand or in advance of his time . on this friday , october 9th , he noted his arrival at suez , and observed that he had as yet neither gained nor lost . he sat down quietly to breakfast in his cabin , never once thinking of inspecting the town , being one of those englishmen who are wo nt to see foreign countries through the eyes of their domestics .",163
the streets of the town were deserted .,4
"at five o'clock he rang his bell for his servant and gave him orders to pack his things for the night - express to town , and to have the brougham at the door by eight - thirty . he was determined not to sleep another night at selby royal . it was an ill - omened place . death walked there in the sunlight . the grass of the forest had been spotted with blood .",24
""" in master 's little apartment , "" conseil answered . "" in master 's museum ! and by now i would have classified master 's fossils . and master 's babirusa would be ensconced in its cage at the zoo in the botanical gardens , and it would have attracted every curiosity seeker in town ! """,55
""" his name is mason , sir ; and he comes from the west indies ; from spanish town , in jamaica , i think . """,18
"it was a flat tableland like that above cape town at the cape of good hope , but of reduced proportions ; at least so it appeared seen from the islet .",9
"candide , cunegund , and the old woman , after passing through lucina , chellas , and letrixa , arrived at length at cadiz . a fleet was then getting ready , and troops were assembling in order to induce the reverend fathers , jesuits of paraguay , who were accused of having excited one of the indian tribes in the neighborhood of the town of the holy sacrament , to revolt against the kings of spain and portugal .",64
""" yes , "" returned sir francis , "" burned alive . and , if she were not , you can not conceive what treatment she would be obliged to submit to from her relatives . they would shave off her hair , feed her on a scanty allowance of rice , treat her with contempt ; she would be looked upon as an unclean creature , and would die in some corner , like a scurvy dog . the prospect of so frightful an existence drives these poor creatures to the sacrifice much more than love or religious fanaticism . sometimes , however , the sacrifice is really voluntary , and it requires the active interference of the government to prevent it . several years ago , when i was living at bombay , a young widow asked permission of the governor to be burned along with her husband 's body ; but , as you may imagine , he refused . the woman left the town , took refuge with an independent rajah , and there carried out her self - devoted purpose . """,167
"through the ingenuousness of her age beamed an ardent mind , not of the woman , but of the poet . she did not please ; she intoxicated . she lived in a small town with her brother , who was a curate .",34
""" you will when you are out of the country : when you get back to spanish town , you may think of her as dead and buried -- or rather , you need not think of her at all . """,17
"at this cry all the crowd re - entered the apartment , and throughout the palace and town there was nothing but consternation and tumult .",17
""" it was at my advice that sir charles was about to go to london . his heart was , i knew , affected , and the constant anxiety in which he lived , however chimerical the cause of it might be , was evidently having a serious effect upon his health . i thought that a few months among the distractions of town would send him back a new man . mr . stapleton , a mutual friend who was much concerned at his state of health , was of the same opinion . at the last instant came this terrible catastrophe .",63
""" dear lady narborough , "" murmured dorian , smiling , "" i have not been in love for a whole week -- not , in fact , since madame de ferrol left town . """,33
"night came on ; the train passed on at full speed , in the midst of the roaring of the tigers , bears , and wolves which fled before the locomotive ; and the marvels of bengal , golconda ruined gour , murshedabad , the ancient capital , burdwan , hugly , and the french town of chandernagor , where passepartout would have been proud to see his country 's flag flying , were hidden from their view in the darkness .",55
"mr . fogg , aouda , and passepartout were conducted to a palkigahri , a sort of four - wheeled carriage , drawn by two horses , in which they took their places and were driven away . no one spoke during the twenty minutes which elapsed before they reached their destination . they first passed through the "" black town , "" with its narrow streets , its miserable , dirty huts , and squalid population ; then through the "" european town , "" which presented a relief in its bright brick mansions , shaded by coconut - trees and bristling with masts , where , although it was early morning , elegantly dressed horsemen and handsome equipages were passing back and forth .",60
"we had , first and last , killed about threescore of them , and had it been daylight we had killed many more . the field of battle being thus cleared , we made forward again , for we had still near a league to go . we heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the woods as we went several times , and sometimes we fancied we saw some of them ; but the snow dazzling our eyes , we were not certain . in about an hour more we came to the town where we were to lodge , which we found in a terrible fright and all in arms ; for , it seems , the night before the wolves and some bears had broken into the village , and put them in such terror that they were obliged to keep guard night and day , but especially in the night , to preserve their cattle , and indeed their people .",95
my father said nothing about her money ; but he told me miss mason was the boast of spanish town for her beauty : and this was no lie .,19
""" there , "" he added , "" out there lies true existence ! and i can imagine the founding of nautical towns , clusters of underwater households that , like the nautilus , would return to the surface of the sea to breathe each morning , free towns if ever there were , independent cities ! then again , who knows whether some tyrant . . .
