""" there is really not much to tell , "" cried dorian as they took their seats at the small round table . "" what happened was simply this . after i left you yesterday evening , harry , i dressed , had some dinner at that little italian restaurant in rupert street you introduced me to , and went down at eight o'clock to the theatre . sibyl was playing rosalind . of course , the scenery was dreadful and the orlando absurd . but sibyl ! you should have seen her ! when she came on in her boy 's clothes , she was perfectly wonderful . she wore a moss - coloured velvet jerkin with cinnamon sleeves , slim , brown , cross - gartered hose , a dainty little green cap with a hawk 's feather caught in a jewel , and a hooded cloak lined with dull red . she had never seemed to me more exquisite . she had all the delicate grace of that tanagra figurine that you have in your studio , basil . her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round a pale rose . as for her acting -- well , you shall see her to - night . she is simply a born artist .",74
"i sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled . i forgot that i was in london and in the nineteenth century . i was away with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen . after the performance was over , i went behind and spoke to her . as we were sitting together , suddenly there came into her eyes a look that i had never seen there before . my lips moved towards hers . we kissed each other . i ca n't describe to you what i felt at that moment . it seemed to me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of rose - coloured joy . she trembled all over and shook like a white narcissus . then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands . i feel that i should not tell you all this , but i ca n't help it . of course , our engagement is a dead secret . she has not even told her own mother . i do n't know what my guardians will say . lord radley is sure to be furious . i do n't care . i shall be of age in less than a year , and then i can do what i like . i have been right , basil , have n't i , to take my love out of poetry and to find my wife in shakespeare 's plays ? lips that shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear . i have had the arms of rosalind around me , and kissed juliet on the mouth .

"over the ensuing days and weeks , captain nemo was very frugal with his visits . i saw him only at rare intervals . his chief officer regularly fixed the positions i found reported on the chart , and in such a way that i could exactly plot the nautilus 's course .",51
""" too much of yourself in it ! upon my word , basil , i did n't know you were so vain ; and i really ca n't see any resemblance between you , with your rugged strong face and your coal - black hair , and this young adonis , who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose - leaves . why , my dear basil , he is a narcissus , and you-- well , of course you have an intellectual expression and all that . but beauty , real beauty , ends where an intellectual expression begins . intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration , and destroys the harmony of any face . the moment one sits down to think , one becomes all nose , or all forehead , or something horrid . look at the successful men in any of the learned professions . how perfectly hideous they are ! except , of course , in the church . but then in the church they do n't think . a bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen , and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful .",82

""" you do n't understand me , harry , "" answered the artist . "" of course i am not like him . i know that perfectly well . indeed , i should be sorry to look like him . you shrug your shoulders ? i am telling you the truth . there is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction , the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings . it is better not to be different from one 's fellows . the ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world . they can sit at their ease and gape at the play . if they know nothing of victory , they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat . they live as we all should live -- undisturbed , indifferent , and without disquiet . they neither bring ruin upon others , nor ever receive it from alien hands . your rank and wealth , harry ; my brains , such as they are -- my art , whatever it may be worth ; dorian gray 's good looks -- we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us , suffer terribly .

"lord henry looked across the table . "" dorian is never annoyed with me , "" he answered . "" i asked the question for the best reason possible , for the only reason , indeed , that excuses one for asking any question-- simple curiosity . i have a theory that it is always the women who propose to us , and not we who propose to the women . except , of course , in middle - class life . but then the middle classes are not modern .

"lord henry shrugged his shoulders . "" my dear fellow , mediaeval art is charming , but mediaeval emotions are out of date . one can use them in fiction , of course . but then the only things that one can use in fiction are the things that one has ceased to use in fact . believe me , no civilized man ever regrets a pleasure , and no uncivilized man ever knows what a pleasure is .

"but she was greatly embarrassed . she did not know whether the abbess was a royalist or a cardinalist ; she therefore confined herself to a prudent middle course . but the abbess , on her part , maintained a reserve still more prudent , contenting herself with making a profound inclination of the head every time the fair traveler pronounced the name of his eminence .",28
