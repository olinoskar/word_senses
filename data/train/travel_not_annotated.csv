"had he travelled ? it was likely , for no one seemed to know the world more familiarly ; there was no spot so secluded that he did not appear to have an intimate acquaintance with it . he often corrected , with a few clear words , the thousand conjectures advanced by members of the club as to lost and unheard - of travellers , pointing out the true probabilities , and seeming as if gifted with a sort of second sight , so often did events justify his predictions . he must have travelled everywhere , at least in the spirit .",95

"this time there could be no doubt ; d’artagnan was really insulted . full , then , of this conviction , he pulled his cap down over his eyes , and endeavoring to copy some of the court airs he had picked up in gascony among young traveling nobles , he advanced with one hand on the hilt of his sword and the other resting on his hip .",47

"on april 13 , 1867 , with a smooth sea and a moderate breeze , the scotia lay in longitude 15 degrees 12 ' and latitude 45 degrees 37 ' . it was traveling at a speed of 13.43 knots under the thrust of its 1,000-horsepower engines . its paddle wheels were churning the sea with perfect steadiness . it was then drawing 6.7 meters of water and displacing 6,624 cubic meters .",33
"now then , justly or unjustly , it was the "" monster "" who stood accused of their disappearance ; and since , thanks to it , travel between the various continents had become more and more dangerous , the public spoke up and demanded straight out that , at all cost , the seas be purged of this fearsome cetacean .",27

"but this hypothesis of a war machine collapsed in the face of formal denials from the various governments . since the public interest was at stake and transoceanic travel was suffering , the sincerity of these governments could not be doubted . besides , how could the assembly of this underwater boat have escaped public notice ? keeping a secret under such circumstances would be difficult enough for an individual , and certainly impossible for a nation whose every move is under constant surveillance by rival powers .",28

"the transparency of salt water has long been recognized . its clarity is believed to exceed that of spring water . the mineral and organic substances it holds in suspension actually increase its translucency . in certain parts of the caribbean sea , you can see the sandy bottom with startling distinctness as deep as 145 meters down , and the penetrating power of the sun 's rays seems to give out only at a depth of 300 meters . but in this fluid setting traveled by the nautilus , our electric glow was being generated in the very heart of the waves . it was no longer illuminated water , it was liquid light .",85

"the aspect of the country , as well as the manners and distinctions of race , is daily changing . formerly one was obliged to travel in india by the old cumbrous methods of going on foot or on horseback , in palanquins or unwieldy coaches ; now fast steamboats ply on the indus and the ganges , and a great railway , with branch lines joining the main line at many points on its route , traverses the peninsula from bombay to calcutta in three days .",25
