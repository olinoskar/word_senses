"i confess that such discussions with the canadian always baffled me . i did n't want to restrict my companions ' freedom in any way , and yet i had no desire to leave captain nemo . thanks to him and his submersible , i was finishing my undersea research by the day , and i was rewriting my book on the great ocean depths in the midst of its very element . would i ever again have such an opportunity to observe the ocean 's wonders ? absolutely not ! so i could n't entertain this idea of leaving the nautilus before completing our course of inquiry .",7,"('canadian', 'canadien', 'canadiense')",0
"i went below to the cabin occupied by ned land and conseil , and i informed them of the captain 's decision . i 'll let the reader decide how this news was received by the canadian . in any case , there was no time for explanations . four crewmen were waiting at the door , and they led us to the cell where we had spent our first night aboard the nautilus .",36,"('canadian', 'canadien', 'canadiense')",0

"that 's how we ended this conversation , which later was to have such serious consequences . at first , i must say , events seemed to confirm my forecasts , much to the canadian 's despair . did captain nemo view us with distrust in these heavily traveled seas , or did he simply want to hide from the sight of those ships of every nation that plowed the mediterranean ? i have no idea , but usually he stayed in midwater and well out from any coast . either the nautilus surfaced only enough to let its pilothouse emerge , or it slipped away to the lower depths , although , between the greek islands and asia minor , we did n't find bottom even at 2,000 meters down .",34,"('canadian', 'canadien', 'canadiense')",0
