"as i looked at his lofty forehead , still and pale as a white stone -- at his fine lineaments fixed in study -- i comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband : that it would be a trying thing to be his wife .",22
"the officer who had stopped in front of her and studied her with so much care might have been twenty - five or twenty - six years of age . he was of pale complexion , with clear blue eyes , rather deeply set ; his mouth , fine and well cut , remained motionless in its correct lines ; his chin , strongly marked , denoted that strength of will which in the ordinary britannic type denotes mostly nothing but obstinacy ; a brow a little receding , as is proper for poets , enthusiasts , and soldiers , was scarcely shaded by short thin hair which , like the beard which covered the lower part of his face , was of a beautiful deep chestnut color .",10
""" now , allow me to finish what i have to tell you . i 've heard of you , professor aronnax . you , if not your companions , wo n't perhaps complain too much about the stroke of fate that has brought us together . among the books that make up my favorite reading , you 'll find the work you 've published on the great ocean depths . i 've pored over it . you 've taken your studies as far as terrestrial science can go . but you do n't know everything because you have n't seen everything . let me tell you , professor , you wo n't regret the time you spend aboard my vessel . you 're going to voyage through a land of wonders . stunned amazement will probably be your habitual state of mind . it will be a long while before you tire of the sights constantly before your eyes . i 'm going to make another underwater tour of the world-- perhaps my last , who knows?--and i 'll review everything i 've studied in the depths of these seas that i 've crossed so often , and you can be my fellow student . starting this very day , you 'll enter a new element , you 'll see what no human being has ever seen before-- since my men and i no longer count -- and thanks to me , you 're going to learn the ultimate secrets of our planet .

"and i rushed into my redoubtable master 's study . otto liedenbrock had no mischief in him , i willingly allow that ; but unless he very considerably changes as he grows older , at the end he will be a most original character .",8
"that study of his was a museum , and nothing else . specimens of everything known in mineralogy lay there in their places in perfect order , and correctly named , divided into inflammable , metallic , and lithoid minerals .",1
"as our mutual happiness ( _ i.e. _ , diana 's , mary 's , and mine ) settled into a quieter character , and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies , st . john stayed more at home : he sat with us in the same room , sometimes for hours together .",32

"we had been left to ourselves for twenty minutes , trying to detect the tiniest noises inside the nautilus , when captain nemo entered . he did n't seem to see us . his facial features , usually so emotionless , revealed a certain uneasiness . he studied the compass and pressure gauge in silence , then went and put his finger on the world map at a spot in the sector depicting the southernmost seas .",47
""" the writing on the wall was done with a man 's forefinger dipped in blood . my glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing it , which would not have been the case if the man 's nail had been trimmed . i gathered up some scattered ash from the floor . it was dark in colour and flakey — such an ash as is only made by a trichinopoly . i have made a special study of cigar ashes — in fact , i have written a monograph upon the subject . i flatter myself that i can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand , either of cigar or of tobacco . it is just in such details that the skilled detective differs from the gregson and lestrade type .

"it was a library . tall , black - rosewood bookcases , inlaid with copperwork , held on their wide shelves a large number of uniformly bound books . these furnishings followed the contours of the room , their lower parts leading to huge couches upholstered in maroon leather and curved for maximum comfort . light , movable reading stands , which could be pushed away or pulled near as desired , allowed books to be positioned on them for easy study . in the center stood a huge table covered with pamphlets , among which some newspapers , long out of date , were visible . electric light flooded this whole harmonious totality , falling from four frosted half globes set in the scrollwork of the ceiling . i stared in genuine wonderment at this room so ingeniously laid out , and i could n't believe my eyes .",81
""" where could one find greater silence or solitude , professor ? "" captain nemo replied . "" did your study at the museum afford you such a perfect retreat ? """,20
"i could barely glimpse the swift passing of longnose sharks , hammerhead sharks , spotted dogfish that frequent these waters , big eagle rays , swarms of seahorse looking like knights on a chessboard , eels quivering like fireworks serpents , armies of crab that fled obliquely by crossing their pincers over their carapaces , finally schools of porpoise that held contests of speed with the nautilus . but by this point observing , studying , and classifying were out of the question .",74
""" for six hundred years snæfell has been dumb ; but he may speak again . now , eruptions are always preceded by certain well - known phenomena . i have therefore examined the natives , i have studied external appearances , and i can assure you , axel , that there will be no eruption . """,38
"i mused on all the consequences of this situation . captain nemo did n't stop studying the pressure gauge . since the toppling of this iceberg , the nautilus had risen about 150 feet , but it still stayed at the same angle to the perpendicular .",15
""" well , sir , i thought no more of the matter , and never would have done had it not been for my wife . only a few weeks ago she was cleaning out sir charles 's study -- it had never been touched since his death -- and she found the ashes of a burned letter in the back of the grate . the greater part of it was charred to pieces , but one little slip , the end of a page , hung together , and the writing could still be read , though it was gray on a black ground . it seemed to us to be a postscript at the end of the letter , and it said : ' please , please , as you are a gentleman , burn this letter , and be at the gate by ten o clock . beneath it were signed the initials l. l.

"i have studied how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride ; and , only the other day , i had a pleasing proof of my success .",2
there looked down upon me the faithful companion of my labours and my recreations . every day she helped me to arrange my uncle 's precious specimens ; she and i labelled them together . mademoiselle gräuben was an accomplished mineralogist ; she could have taught a few things to a savant . she was fond of investigating abstruse scientific questions . what pleasant hours we have spent in study ; and how often i envied the very stones which she handled with her charming fingers .,69
"all the rest of the furniture indicated that the dweller in this house occupied himself with the study of natural science . there were large bottles filled with serpents , ticketed according to their species ; dried lizards shone like emeralds set in great squares of black wood , and bunches of wild odoriferous herbs , doubtless possessed of virtues unknown to common men , were fastened to the ceiling and hung down in the corners of the apartment .",17
"the skiff advanced toward mannar island , which curved to the south . captain nemo stood up from his thwart and studied the sea .",21
"the hours passed . i often studied the instruments hanging on the lounge wall . the pressure gauge indicated that the nautilus stayed at a constant depth of 300 meters , the compass that it kept heading south , the log that it was traveling at a speed of twenty miles per hour , an excessive speed in such a cramped area . but captain nemo knew that by this point there was no such thing as too fast , since minutes were now worth centuries .",6

"but still further , his education had been so little neglected , even with respect to scholastic studies , so rare at this time among gentlemen , that he smiled at the scraps of latin which aramis sported and which porthos pretended to understand . two or three times , even , to the great astonishment of his friends , he had , when aramis allowed some rudimental error to escape him , replaced a verb in its right tense and a noun in its case .",17
""" this is all very fine , dear aramis , "" murmured d’artagnan . "" ah , monsieur hypocrite , i understand how you study theology . """,24
"the son , who had been his father 's secretary , had resigned along with his chief , somewhat foolishly as was thought at the time , and on succeeding some months later to the title , had set himself to the serious study of the great aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing . he had two large town houses , but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble , and took most of his meals at his club . he paid some attention to the management of his collieries in the midland counties , excusing himself for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of burning wood on his own hearth .",43
"not one of the former colonists of lincoln island was absent , for they had sworn to live always together . neb was with his master ; ayrton was there ready to sacrifice himself for all ; pencroft was more a farmer than he had ever been a sailor ; herbert , who completed his studies under the superintendence of cyrus harding , and gideon spilett , who founded the new lincoln herald , the best - informed journal in the world .",55
"i do n't suppose the maddest geologist under such circumstances would have studied the nature of the rocks that we were passing . i am sure i did trouble my head about them . pliocene , miocene , eocene , cretaceous , jurassic , triassic , permian , carboniferous , devonian , silurian , or primitive was all one to me . but the professor , no doubt , was pursuing his observations or taking notes , for in one of our halts he said to me :",12
"is there not one face you study ? one figure whose movements you follow with at least curiosity ? """,6
""" yes , professor , "" he answered me . "" i studied in london , paris , and new york back in the days when i was a resident of the earth 's continents . """,12
"d’artagnan , a little recovered from his first surprise , had now leisure to study costumes and physiognomy .",14
"then the nautilus drew near the beaches of africa , where the sea is considerably deeper . there , through the open panels and in a midwater of crystal clarity , our ship enabled us to study wonderful bushes of shining coral and huge chunks of rock wrapped in splendid green furs of algae and fucus . what an indescribable sight , and what a variety of settings and scenery where these reefs and volcanic islands leveled off by the libyan coast ! but soon the nautilus hugged the eastern shore where these tree forms appeared in all their glory . this was off the coast of tihama , and there such zoophyte displays not only flourished below sea level but they also fashioned picturesque networks that unreeled as high as ten fathoms above it ; the latter were more whimsical but less colorful than the former , which kept their bloom thanks to the moist vitality of the waters .",36
"after his first depression , passepartout became calmer , and began to study his situation . it was certainly not an enviable one . he found himself on the way to japan , and what should he do when he got there ? his pocket was empty ; he had not a solitary shilling , not so much as a penny . his passage had fortunately been paid for in advance ; and he had five or six days in which to decide upon his future course . he fell to at meals with an appetite , and ate for mr . fogg , aouda , and himself . he helped himself as generously as if japan were a desert , where nothing to eat was to be looked for .",12

"as soon as i was dressed , i made my way to the main lounge . it was deserted . i dove into studying the conchological treasures amassed inside the glass cases . i also investigated the huge plant albums that were filled with the rarest marine herbs , which , although they were pressed and dried , still kept their wonderful colors . among these valuable water plants , i noted various seaweed : some cladostephus verticillatus , peacock 's tails , fig - leafed caulerpa , grain - bearing beauty bushes , delicate rosetangle tinted scarlet , sea colander arranged into fan shapes , mermaid 's cups that looked like the caps of squat mushrooms and for years had been classified among the zoophytes ; in short , a complete series of algae .",23

"passepartout , about nine o'clock , went out upon the platform to take the air . the weather was cold , the heavens grey , but it was not snowing . the sun 's disc , enlarged by the mist , seemed an enormous ring of gold , and passepartout was amusing himself by calculating its value in pounds sterling , when he was diverted from this interesting study by a strange - looking personage who made his appearance on the platform .",68

"before she went to bed she had pondered , analyzed , turned on all sides , examined on all points , the words , the steps , the gestures , the signs , and even the silence of her interlocutors ; and of this profound , skillful , and anxious study the result was that felton , everything considered , appeared the more vulnerable of her two persecutors .",50
"so i did n't allude to this event when , that evening , i chanced to be alone with the captain in the lounge . besides , he seemed silent and preoccupied . then , contrary to custom , he ordered that both panels in the lounge be opened , and going from the one to the other , he carefully observed the watery mass . for what purpose ? i had n't a guess , and for my part , i spent my time studying the fish that passed before my eyes .",85
"the fact is that our friend , the baronet , begins to display a considerable interest in our fair neighbour . it is not to be wondered at , for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an active man like him , and she is a very fascinating and beautiful woman . there is something tropical and exotic about her which forms a singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother . yet he also gives the idea of hidden fires . he has certainly a very marked influence over her , for i have seen her continually glance at him as she talked as if seeking approbation for what she said . i trust that he is kind to her . there is a dry glitter in his eyes , and a firm set of his thin lips , which goes with a positive and possibly a harsh nature . you would find him an interesting study .",159

"after leaving these delightful islands to the protection of the french flag , the nautilus covered about 2,000 miles from december 4 to the 11th . its navigating was marked by an encounter with an immense school of squid , unusual mollusks that are near neighbors of the cuttlefish . french fishermen give them the name "" cuckoldfish , "" and they belong to the class cephalopoda , family dibranchiata , consisting of themselves together with cuttlefish and argonauts . the naturalists of antiquity made a special study of them , and these animals furnished many ribald figures of speech for soapbox orators in the greek marketplace , as well as excellent dishes for the tables of rich citizens , if we 're to believe athenaeus , a greek physician predating galen .",87

"it was a delightful animal whose discovery , according to the ancients , is a sign of good luck . aristotle , athenaeus , pliny , and oppian studied its habits and lavished on its behalf all the scientific poetry of greece and italy . they called it "" nautilus "" and "" pompilius .
