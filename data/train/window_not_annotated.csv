"going back under the waters , the nautilus drew near the coast , cruising along it for only a few miles . through the lounge windows i could see long creepers and gigantic fucus plants , bulb - bearing seaweed of which the open sea at the pole had revealed a few specimens ; with their smooth , viscous filaments , they measured as much as 300 meters long ; genuine cables more than an inch thick and very tough , they 're often used as mooring lines for ships . another weed , known by the name velp and boasting four - foot leaves , was crammed into the coral concretions and carpeted the ocean floor . it served as both nest and nourishment for myriads of crustaceans and mollusks , for crabs and cuttlefish . here seals and otters could indulge in a sumptuous meal , mixing meat from fish with vegetables from the sea , like the english with their irish stews .",25

"there once more , through the panels opening into these caribbean waters ten meters below the surface of the waves , i found so many fascinating exhibits to describe in my daily notes ! among other zoophytes there were portuguese men - of - war known by the name physalia pelagica , like big , oblong bladders with a pearly sheen , spreading their membranes to the wind , letting their blue tentacles drift like silken threads ; to the eye delightful jellyfish , to the touch actual nettles that ooze a corrosive liquid . among the articulates there were annelid worms one and a half meters long , furnished with a pink proboscis , equipped with 1,700 organs of locomotion , snaking through the waters , and as they went , throwing off every gleam in the solar spectrum . from the fish branch there were manta rays , enormous cartilaginous fish ten feet long and weighing 600 pounds , their pectoral fin triangular , their midback slightly arched , their eyes attached to the edges of the face at the front of the head ; they floated like wreckage from a ship , sometimes fastening onto our windows like opaque shutters . there were american triggerfish for which nature has ground only black and white pigments , feather - shaped gobies that were long and plump with yellow fins and jutting jaws , sixteen - decimeter mackerel with short , sharp teeth , covered with small scales , and related to the albacore species . next came swarms of red mullet corseted in gold stripes from head to tail , their shining fins all aquiver , genuine masterpieces of jewelry , formerly sacred to the goddess diana , much in demand by rich romans , and about which the old saying goes : "" he who catches them does n't eat them ! "" finally , adorned with emerald ribbons and dressed in velvet and silk , golden angelfish passed before our eyes like courtiers in the paintings of veronese ; spurred gilthead stole by with their swift thoracic fins ; thread herring fifteen inches long were wrapped in their phosphorescent glimmers ; gray mullet thrashed the sea with their big fleshy tails ; red salmon seemed to mow the waves with their slicing pectorals ; and silver moonfish , worthy of their name , rose on the horizon of the waters like the whitish reflections of many moons .",199

"it was a squid of colossal dimensions , fully eight meters long . it was traveling backward with tremendous speed in the same direction as the nautilus . it gazed with enormous , staring eyes that were tinted sea green . its eight arms ( or more accurately , feet ) were rooted in its head , which has earned these animals the name cephalopod ; its arms stretched a distance twice the length of its body and were writhing like the serpentine hair of the furies . you could plainly see its 250 suckers , arranged over the inner sides of its tentacles and shaped like semispheric capsules . sometimes these suckers fastened onto the lounge window by creating vacuums against it . the monster 's mouth -- a beak made of horn and shaped like that of a parrot -- opened and closed vertically . its tongue , also of horn substance and armed with several rows of sharp teeth , would flicker out from between these genuine shears . what a freak of nature ! a bird 's beak on a mollusk ! its body was spindle - shaped and swollen in the middle , a fleshy mass that must have weighed 20,000 to 25,000 kilograms . its unstable color would change with tremendous speed as the animal grew irritated , passing successively from bluish gray to reddish brown .",117
"snow began to fall an hour after they started , a fine snow , however , which happily could not obstruct the train ; nothing could be seen from the windows but a vast , white sheet , against which the smoke of the locomotive had a greyish aspect .",30

"this homeric slaughter dragged on for an hour , and the long - skulled predators could n't get away . several times ten or twelve of them teamed up , trying to crush the nautilus with their sheer mass . through the windows you could see their enormous mouths paved with teeth , their fearsome eyes . losing all self - control , ned land hurled threats and insults at them . you could feel them clinging to the submersible like hounds atop a wild boar in the underbrush . but by forcing the pace of its propeller , the nautilus carried them off , dragged them under , or brought them back to the upper level of the waters , untroubled by their enormous weight or their powerful grip .",42
"for several hours the nautilus drifted in this brilliant tide , and our wonderment grew when we saw huge marine animals cavorting in it , like the fire - dwelling salamanders of myth . in the midst of these flames that did n't burn , i could see swift , elegant porpoises , the tireless pranksters of the seas , and sailfish three meters long , those shrewd heralds of hurricanes , whose fearsome broadswords sometimes banged against the lounge window . then smaller fish appeared : miscellaneous triggerfish , leather jacks , unicornfish , and a hundred others that left stripes on this luminous atmosphere in their course .",80
