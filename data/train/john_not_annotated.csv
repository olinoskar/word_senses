st . john arrived first .,2
""" mr . john ? """,3
st . john was a good man ; but i began to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold .,2
"while the driver and hannah brought in the boxes , they demanded st . john . at this moment he advanced from the parlour .",14
"st . john said these words as he pronounced his sermons , with a quiet , deep voice ; with an unflushed cheek , and a coruscating radiance of glance .",2
"st . john did not rebuke our vivacity ; but he escaped from it : he was seldom in the house ; his parish was large , the population scattered , and he found daily business in visiting the sick and poor in its different districts .",2
"just then my eye was caught by some etchings hanging on the wall , which i had n't noticed during my first visit . they were portraits of great men of history who had spent their lives in perpetual devotion to a great human ideal : thaddeus kosciusko , the hero whose dying words had been finis poloniae ; markos botzaris , for modern greece the reincarnation of sparta 's king leonidas ; daniel o'connell , ireland 's defender ; george washington , founder of the american union ; daniele manin , the italian patriot ; abraham lincoln , dead from the bullet of a believer in slavery ; and finally , that martyr for the redemption of the black race , john brown , hanging from his gallows as victor hugo 's pencil has so terrifyingly depicted .",122
"the name of liedenbrock was honourably mentioned in colleges and learned societies . humphry davy , [ 2 ] humboldt , captain sir john franklin , general sabine , never failed to call upon him on their way through hamburg . becquerel , ebelman , brewster , dumas , milne - edwards , saint - claire - deville frequently consulted him upon the most difficult problems in chemistry , a science which was indebted to him for considerable discoveries , for in 1853 there had appeared at leipzig an imposing folio by otto liedenbrock , entitled , "" a treatise upon transcendental chemistry , "" with plates ; a work , however , which failed to cover its expenses .",23
"as our mutual happiness ( _ i.e. _ , diana 's , mary 's , and mine ) settled into a quieter character , and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies , st . john stayed more at home : he sat with us in the same room , sometimes for hours together .",36
"st . john was not a man to be lightly refused : you felt that every impression made on him , either for pain or pleasure , was deep - graved and permanent . i consented .",2
"when diana and mary returned , the former found her scholar transferred from her to her brother : she laughed , and both she and mary agreed that st . john should never have persuaded them to such a step .",30
"st . john looks quiet , jane ; but he hides a fever in his vitals .",2
""" st . john ! you used to call jane your third sister , but you do n't treat her as such : you should kiss her too . """,3
"i thought diana very provoking , and felt uncomfortably confused ; and while i was thus thinking and feeling , st . john bent his head ; his greek face was brought to a level with mine , his eyes questioned my eyes piercingly -- he kissed me .",22
"i felt a little embarrassed . perhaps i had too rashly over - leaped conventionalities ; and he , like st . john , saw impropriety in my inconsiderateness .",22
st . john passed the window reading a letter . he entered .,2
"in the course of my necessary correspondence with mr . briggs about the will , i had inquired if he knew anything of mr . rochester 's present residence and state of health ; but , as st . john had conjectured , he was quite ignorant of all concerning him .",39
st . john called me to his side to read ; in attempting to do this my voice failed me : words were lost in sobs .,2
john rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression .,0
"mary and i would have esteemed ourselves rich with a thousand pounds each ; and to st . john such a sum would have been valuable , for the good it would have enabled him to do . """,18
i took a seat : st . john stood near me .,7
"i stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a hireling , and it was given me by you : i asked a question , expecting john 's wife to answer me , and your voice spoke at my ear . """,28
""" and what does _ your _ heart say ? "" demanded st . john .",14
"a dog -- old carlo , mr . rivers ' pointer , as i saw in a moment -- was pushing the gate with his nose , and st . john himself leant upon it with folded arms ; his brow knit , his gaze , grave almost to displeasure , fixed on me .",30
""" oh , st . john ! "" i cried , "" have some mercy ! """,5
st . john continued--,2
what did st . john rivers think of this earthly angel ?,4
"if i join st . john , i abandon half myself : if i go to india , i go to premature death . and how will the interval between leaving england for india , and india for the grave , be filled ? oh , i know well !",5
""" it is , "" said st . john .",8
"that , too , is very clear to my vision . by straining to satisfy st . john till my sinews ache , i _ shall _ satisfy him -- to the finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations .",17
"john does not at all resemble his father , and i am glad of it : john is like me and like my brothers -- he is quite a gibson .",0
"it seemed to me that mr . st . john 's under lip protruded , and his upper lip curled a moment .",9
""" st . john , "" i returned , "" i regard you as a brother -- you , me as a sister : so let us continue . """,3
"of course , st . john rivers ' name came in frequently in the progress of my tale .",5
""" this st . john , then , is your cousin ? """,4
""" it is not a seasonable hour to intrude on mr . oliver , "" answered st . john .",18
""" seek one elsewhere than in me , st . john : seek one fitted to you . """,10
""" st john was only twenty - nine , sir . """,2
mr . st . john spoke almost like an automaton : himself only knew the effort it cost him thus to refuse .,4
"i had silently feared st . john till now , because i had not understood him .",6
""" st . john ! "" i exclaimed , when i had got so far in my meditation .",3
""" st . john is an accomplished and profound scholar . """,3
""" st . john dresses well . he is a handsome man : tall , fair , with blue eyes , and a grecian profile . """,3
""" missis looks stout and well enough in the face , but i think she 's not quite easy in her mind : mr . john 's conduct does not please her -- he spends a deal of money . """,25
"john bunsby long examined the threatening aspect of the heavens , muttering indistinctly between his teeth . at last he said in a low voice to mr . fogg , "" shall i speak out to your honour ? """,0
""" i scorn the counterfeit sentiment you offer : yes , st . john , and i scorn you when you offer it . """,13
""" oh , if you take it that way , "" said john bunsby , "" i 've nothing more to say . """,12
""" forgive me the words , st . john ; but it is your own fault that i have been roused to speak so unguardedly .",8
""" st . john made you schoolmistress of morton before he knew you were his cousin ? """,3
"st . john , no doubt , would have given the world to follow , recall , retain her , when she thus left him ; but he would not give one chance of heaven , nor relinquish , for the elysium of her love , one hope of the true , eternal paradise . besides , he could not bind all that he had in his nature -- the rover , the aspirant , the poet , the priest -- in the limits of a single passion .",2
""" well said , "" cried aramis ; "" you do nâ€™t often speak , athos , but when you do speak , it is like st . john of the golden mouth .",28
"a very different sort of mind was hers from that , for instance , of the sisters of st . john .",20
""" good - night , st . john , "" said i.",7
"all on board feared that it could not be done , and every one -- phileas fogg , no doubt , excepted -- felt his heart beat with impatience . the boat must keep up an average of nine miles an hour , and the wind was becoming calmer every moment ! it was a capricious breeze , coming from the coast , and after it passed the sea became smooth . still , the tankadere was so light , and her fine sails caught the fickle zephyrs so well , that , with the aid of the currents john bunsby found himself at six o'clock not more than ten miles from the mouth of shanghai river . shanghai itself is situated at least twelve miles up the stream . at seven they were still three miles from shanghai . the pilot swore an angry oath ; the reward of two hundred pounds was evidently on the point of escaping him . he looked at mr . fogg . mr . fogg was perfectly tranquil ; and yet his whole fortune was at this moment at stake .",99
""" john eyre , madeira . """,1
"not that st . john harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness -- not that he would have injured a hair of my head , if it had been fully in his power to do so .",4
"it appeared , then , that her father would throw no obstacle in the way of rosamond 's union with st . john . mr . oliver evidently regarded the young clergyman 's good birth , old name , and sacred profession as sufficient compensation for the want of fortune .",22
"i was absorbed in the execution of these nice details , when , after one rapid tap , my door unclosed , admitting st . john rivers .",25
""" st . john , i am unhappy because you are still angry with me . let us be friends . """,3
""" no , st . john , we are not friends as we were .",5
""" must we part in this way , st . john ? and when you go to india , will you leave me so , without a kinder word than you have yet spoken ? """,10
""" no . st . john , i will not marry you . i adhere to my resolution . """,5
""" no , jane , you are not comfortable there , because your heart is not with me : it is with this cousin -- this st . john .",28
"i wonder when st . john will come home . """,5
""" keep to common sense , st . john : you are verging on nonsense .",8
""" you know -- this st . john rivers . """,7
"ah , childer ! that 's t ' last o ' t ' old stock -- for ye and mr . st . john is like of different soart to them ' at 's gone ; for all your mother wor mich i ' your way , and a'most as book - learned . she wor the pictur ' o ' ye , mary : diana is more like your father . """,23
""" ye'll want your supper , i am sure , "" observed hannah ; "" and so will mr . st . john when he comes in . """,22
"i heard a noise : the wind , i thought , shook the door . no ; it was st . john rivers , who , lifting the latch , came in out of the frozen hurricane -- the howling darkness -- and stood before me : the cloak that covered his tall figure all white as a glacier .",21
""" is it you , mr . st . john ? "" cried hannah .",9
"but the morning passed just as usual : nothing happened to interrupt the quiet course of adele 's studies ; only soon after breakfast , i heard some bustle in the neighbourhood of mr . rochester 's chamber , mrs . fairfax 's voice , and leah 's , and the cook's -- that is , john 's wife -- and even john 's own gruff tones .",56
""" and yet st . john is a good man , "" said diana .",5
"the two ladies , their brother , mr . st . john , the old servant , were all gazing at me .",11
""" st . john , who is it ? "" i heard one ask .",3
"henceforward , i knew what fate st . john feared for me .",8
""" a little more , st . john -- look at the avidity in her eyes . """,7
"the impossible--_i.e . _ , my marriage with st . john -- was fast becoming the possible . all was changing utterly with a sudden sweep .",10
""" my prayers are heard ! "" ejaculated st . john .",10
i began once more to know myself ; and when mr . st . john demanded an account -- which at present i was far too weak to render -- i said after a brief pause--,14
"all the house was still ; for i believe all , except st . john and myself , were now retired to rest .",14
""" what have you heard ? what do you see ? "" asked st . john .",15
""" hannah , "" said mr . st . john , at last , "" let her sit there at present , and ask her no questions ; in ten minutes more , give her the remainder of that milk and bread .",9
"he was passing through the door , when he turned , with flushed face and flashing eyes . "" it were better for you , john ferrier , "" he thundered , "" that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the sierra blanco , than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of the holy four ! "" with a threatening gesture of his hand , he turned from the door , and ferrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path .",25
"i broke from st . john , who had followed , and would have detained me .",5
"i mounted to my chamber ; locked myself in ; fell on my knees ; and prayed in my way -- a different way to st . john 's , but effective in its own fashion . i seemed to penetrate very near a mighty spirit ; and my soul rushed out in gratitude at his feet .",27
"mr . st . john came but once : he looked at me , and said my state of lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted fatigue .",4
"we were parted : i heard the words-- "" dear ! dear ! what a fury to fly at master john ! """,20
""" far otherwise , "" responded diana . "" to speak truth , st . john , my heart rather warms to the poor little soul . i wish we may be able to benefit her permanently . """,15
"meantime , i heard st . john quit his room .",6
""" she is so ill , st . john . """,8
"--yours , st . john . """,4
"how st . john received the news , i do n't know : he never answered the letter in which i communicated it : yet six months after he wrote to me , without , however , mentioning mr . rochester 's name or alluding to my marriage .",3
"thus day followed day ; and as sure as morning came he found that his unseen enemies had kept their register , and had marked up in some conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the month of grace . sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls , sometimes upon the floors , occasionally they were on small placards stuck upon the garden gate or the railings . with all his vigilance john ferrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded . a horror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of them . he became haggard and restless , and his eyes had the troubled look of some hunted creature . he had but one hope in life now , and that was for the arrival of the young hunter from nevada .",78
"what was that ? in the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound â€” low , but very distinct in the quiet of the night . it came from the door of the house . ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently . there was a pause for a few moments , and then the low insidious sound was repeated . someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the panels of the door . was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal ? or was it some agent who was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived . john ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook his nerves and chilled his heart . springing forward he drew the bolt and threw the door open .",114
""" and the gentleman who lives here is called mr . st . john ? """,13
""" the name , then , of that gentleman , is mr . st . john rivers ? """,15
""" aye ; st . john is like his kirstened name . """,5
"as to st . john rivers , he left england : he went to india . he entered on the path he had marked for himself ; he pursues it still .",4
st . john is unmarried : he never will marry now .,2
""" here he is ! "" said she . "" well , john "" ( leaning out ) , "" any news ? """,12
"no fear of death will darken st . john 's last hour : his mind will be unclouded , his heart will be undaunted , his hope will be sure , his faith steadfast .",8
""" then i should love mrs . reed , which i can not do ; i should bless her son john , which is impossible . """,20
""" you are not , perhaps , aware that i am your namesake?--that i was christened st . john eyre rivers ? """,18
st . john smiled .,2
"she closed the door , leaving me solus with mr . st . john , who sat opposite , a book or newspaper in his hand .",13
""" it was nearer one than twelve , and a wild , bleak night , blowing hard and raining in torrents . dismal as it was outside , i was glad within â€” so glad that i could have shouted out from pure exultation . if any of you gentlemen have ever pined for a thing , and longed for it during twenty long years , and then suddenly found it within your reach , you would understand my feelings . i lit a cigar , and puffed at it to steady my nerves , but my hands were trembling , and my temples throbbing with excitement . as i drove , i could see old john ferrier and sweet lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me , just as plain as i see you all in this room . all the way they were ahead of me , one on each side of the horse until i pulled up at the house in the brixton road .",116
""" tell me where i can get you a glass of water , "" said st . john ; "" you must really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings . """,17
""" why , she ca n't be above seventeen or eighteen years old , st . john , "" said she .",16
""" you are too inquisitive , st . john , "" murmured mary in a low voice ; but he leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and piercing look .",8
""" which , if you like , you have , in my opinion , a right to keep , both from st . john and every other questioner , "" remarked diana .",23
"the instruments of transfer were drawn out : st . john , diana , mary , and i , each became possessed of a competency .",10
"on the morning which followed his interview with the mormon prophet , john ferrier went in to salt lake city , and having found his acquaintance , who was bound for the nevada mountains , he entrusted him with his message to jefferson hope . in it he told the young man of the imminent danger which threatened them , and how necessary it was that he should return . having done thus he felt easier in his mind , and returned home with a lighter heart .",12
st . john smiled slightly : still he was dissatisfied .,2
but when st . john had mused a few moments he recommenced as imperturbably and with as much acumen as ever .,4
""" she has already said that she is willing to do anything honest she can do , "" answered diana for me ; "" and you know , st . john , she has no choice of helpers : she is forced to put up with such crusty people as you . """,30
""" right , "" said mr . st . john , quite coolly . "" if such is your spirit , i promise to aid you , in my own time and way . """,9
