"a rap at this moment sounded on the door of the cosy apartment where phileas fogg was seated , and james forster , the dismissed servant , appeared .",12
"and louis xiii , opening the door of communication , passed into the corridor which led from his apartments to those of anne of austria .",18
""" oh , he wo n’t return ; and if he should , he will be told that i have brought a woman with me , and that woman is in his apartment . """,32
""" pardon , my dear monsieur bonacieux , if i do n’t stand upon ceremony , "" said d’artagnan , "" but nothing makes one so thirsty as want of sleep . i am parched with thirst . allow me to take a glass of water in your apartment ; you know that is never refused among neighbors . """,48
"on leaving the convent he entered into the magistracy , became president on the place of his uncle , embraced the cardinal ’s party , which did not prove want of sagacity , became chancellor , served his eminence with zeal in his hatred against the queen - mother and his vengeance against anne of austria , stimulated the judges in the affair of calais , encouraged the attempts of m. de laffemas , chief gamekeeper of france ; then , at length , invested with the entire confidence of the cardinal -- a confidence which he had so well earned -- he received the singular commission for the execution of which he presented himself in the queen ’s apartments .",119
"i will now go up into my apartment . i will make planchet brush my boots ; and when he has done , i will , if you like , send him to you to brush your shoes . """,7
"but he was never to be found at home ; he never invited anybody to go up with him , and no one could form an idea of what his sumptuous apartment contained in the shape of real riches .",31
on his part the king returned to his apartment .,8
in another moment i was within that apartment .,7
"athos required no more . he arose , bowed , went out , returned by the same way he came , re - entered the hotel , and went to his apartment .",31
"the next day , when felton entered milady ’s apartment he found her standing , mounted upon a chair , holding in her hands a cord made by means of torn cambric handkerchiefs , twisted into a kind of rope one with another , and tied at the ends . at the noise felton made in entering , milady leaped lightly to the ground , and tried to conceal behind her the improvised cord she held in her hand .",9
"in this apartment a continued buzzing prevailed from morning till night , while m. de treville , in his office contiguous to this antechamber , received visits , listened to complaints , gave his orders , and like the king in his balcony at the louvre , had only to place himself at the window to review both his men and arms .",2
"no sooner did she enter his apartment than she cried out , "" how , monsieur candide , have you quite forgot your pacquette ? do you not know her again ? """,6
"in consequence thereof they had seized on a biscayan for marrying his godmother , and on two portuguese for taking out the bacon of a larded pullet they were eating ; after dinner they came and secured dr . pangloss , and his pupil candide , the one for speaking his mind , and the other for seeming to approve what he had said . they were conducted to separate apartments , extremely cool , where they were never incommoded with the sun . eight days afterwards they were each dressed in a sanbenito , and their heads were adorned with paper mitres . the mitre and sanbenito worn by candide were painted with flames reversed and with devils that had neither tails nor claws ; but dr . pangloss 's devils had both tails and claws , and his flames were upright .",70
"he walked six or seven times round the place royale , turning at every ten steps to look at the light in milady ’s apartment , which was to be seen through the blinds . it was evident that this time the young woman was not in such haste to retire to her apartment as she had been the first .",53
"at this announcement , during which the door remained open , everyone became mute , and amid the general silence the young man crossed part of the length of the antechamber , and entered the apartment of the captain of the musketeers , congratulating himself with all his heart at having so narrowly escaped the end of this strange quarrel .",35
by eight o’clock in the morning he was at the apartment of athos .,10
"the vault in which we placed it ( and which had been so long unopened that our torches , half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere , gave us little opportunity for investigation ) was small , damp , and entirely without means of admission for light ; lying , at great depth , immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment .",66
"we replaced and screwed down the lid , and , having secured the door of iron , made our way , with toil , into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house .",29
""" yes ; this is the dining - room . i have just opened the window , to let in a little air and sunshine ; for everything gets so damp in apartments that are seldom inhabited ; the drawing - room yonder feels like a vault . """,32
""" holy virgin ! "" cried she , "" what will become of us ? a man killed in my apartment ! if the peace - officers come , we are undone . """,20
felton entered milady ’s apartment .,4
"overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror , unaccountable yet unendurable , i threw on my clothes with haste ( for i felt that i should sleep no more during the night ) , and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which i had fallen , by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment .",57
""" no ; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back ; no one ever sleeps here : one would almost say that , if there were a ghost at thornfield hall , this would be its haunt . """,9
"she then tried to seize the sword with her hands ; but d’artagnan kept it free from her grasp , and presenting the point , sometimes at her eyes , sometimes at her breast , compelled her to glide behind the bedstead , while he aimed at making his retreat by the door which led to kitty ’s apartment .",58
"yes , our brave settlers had reason to be satisfied , and pencroft was lavish in his praise of what he humorously called , "" his apartments on the fifth floor above the ground ! """,26
"motionless , with her burning and fixed glances , in her solitary apartment , how well the outbursts of passion which at times escape from the depths of her chest with her respiration , accompany the sound of the surf which rises , growls , roars , and breaks itself like an eternal and powerless despair against the rocks on which is built this dark and lofty castle !",12
i had heard mr . rochester assign him an apartment below -- what brought him here !,9
"the chamber was evidently furnished for the reception of a woman ; and the most finished coquette could not have formed a wish , but on casting her eyes about the apartment , she would have found that wish accomplished .",31
"he crossed the court , ran up the two flights to athos ’s apartment , and knocked at the door enough to break it down .",13
""" come in , gentlemen , come in , "" called d’artagnan ; "" you are here in my apartment , and we are all faithful servants of the king and cardinal . """,19
"at this cry all the crowd re - entered the apartment , and throughout the palace and town there was nothing but consternation and tumult .",10
""" in there , "" pointing to the apartment she had left ; and i went in , and there he stood .",8
"he passed through several apartments , of an elegance of which even the greatest nobles of france had not even an idea , and arrived at length in a bedchamber which was at once a miracle of taste and of richness .",4
"as to d’artagnan , he did not budge from his apartment .",10
everything in the apartment gave evidence of a violent and desperate struggle .,3
"at half - past eight the door opened , the policeman appeared , and , requesting them to follow him , led the way to an adjoining hall . it was evidently a court - room , and a crowd of europeans and natives already occupied the rear of the apartment .",50
"bessie went into the housemaid 's apartment , which was near . i heard her say--",6
"we descended . fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing - room than that through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner . we found the apartment vacant ; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth , and wax candles shining in bright solitude , amid the exquisite flowers with which the tables were adorned .",29
"a fire was lit in an apartment upstairs , and there i carried our books , and arranged it for the future schoolroom .",6
""" well , go and fetch them , and come to my apartment . we will snatch some supper ; we shall perhaps travel part of the night , and must keep our strength up . """,12
"milady ran up to her apartment quickly ; she there found rochefort ’s lackey , and gave him his instructions .",5
"the grotto was an immense apartment . along its granite floor ran our faithful stream . at this distance from its spring the water was scarcely tepid , and we drank of it with pleasure .",5
i sit in the shade -- if any shade there be in this brilliantly - lit apartment ; the window - curtain half hides me . again the arch yawns ; they come .,16
"terror recalled me to myself . "" he entered the apartment followed by a man in a mask .",10
""" never mind . let us return to your apartment . we shall be safer there than in the doorway . """,9
the young man then entered the apartment of aramis .,6
he gazed into the apartment .,4
