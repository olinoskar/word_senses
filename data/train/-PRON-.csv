"i had no reply to this , and i feared that captain nemo would n't take us homeward but rather into that huge ocean washing the shores of both asia and america . in this way he would complete his underwater tour of the world , going back to those seas where the nautilus enjoyed the greatest freedom . but if we returned to the pacific , far from every populated shore , what would happen to ned land 's plans ?",39,"('-PRON-', 'son', 'su')",0
i shared the results of my observations with the canadian and conseil .,5,"('-PRON-', 'mon', 'mi')",1
"we did n't leave these patagonian waterways until april 3 , sometimes cruising under the ocean , sometimes on its surface . the nautilus passed the wide estuary formed by the mouth of the rio de la plata , and on april 4 we lay abreast of uruguay , albeit fifty miles out . keeping to its northerly heading , it followed the long windings of south america . by then we had fared 16,000 leagues since coming on board in the seas of japan .",56,"('-PRON-', 'son', 'su')",0
"we cut the equator . twenty miles to the west lay guiana , french territory where we could easily have taken refuge . but the wind was blowing a strong gust , and the furious billows would not allow us to face them in a mere skiff . no doubt ned land understood this because he said nothing to me . for my part , i made no allusion to his escape plans because i did n't want to push him into an attempt that was certain to misfire .",62,"('-PRON-', 'mon', 'mi')",1

"i was readily compensated for this delay by fascinating research . during those two days of april 11 - 12 , the nautilus did n't leave the surface of the sea , and its trawl brought up a simply miraculous catch of zoophytes , fish , and reptiles .",33,"('-PRON-', 'son', 'su')",0
"poor conseil had assaulted an electric ray of the most dangerous species , the cumana . living in a conducting medium such as water , this bizarre animal can electrocute other fish from several meters away , so great is the power of its electric organ , an organ whose two chief surfaces measure at least twenty - seven square feet .",43,"('-PRON-', 'son', 'su')",0
"the same day an odd fishing practice further increased the nautilus 's stores , so full of game were these seas . our trawl brought up in its meshes a number of fish whose heads were topped by little oval slabs with fleshy edges . these were suckerfish from the third family of the subbrachian malacopterygia . these flat disks on their heads consist of crosswise plates of movable cartilage , between which the animals can create a vacuum , enabling them to stick to objects like suction cups .",27,"('-PRON-', 'son', 'su')",0
"the canadian was quite disheartened , having counted on putting his plans into execution in the gulf , either by reaching shore or by pulling alongside one of the many boats plying a coastal trade from one island to another . an escape attempt would have been quite feasible , assuming ned land managed to seize the skiff without the captain 's knowledge . but in midocean it was unthinkable .",10,"('-PRON-', 'son', 'su')",0
"this measure was distasteful to me . to my mind it would lead nowhere . we could hope for nothing from the nautilus 's commander but could depend only on ourselves . besides , for some time now the man had been gloomier , more withdrawn , less sociable . he seemed to be avoiding me . i encountered him only at rare intervals . he used to take pleasure in explaining the underwater wonders to me ; now he left me to my research and no longer entered the lounge .",83,"('-PRON-', 'mon', 'mi')",1
"what changes had come over him ? from what cause ? i had no reason to blame myself . was our presence on board perhaps a burden to him ? even so , i cherished no hopes that the man would set us free .",5,"('-PRON-', 'lui', 'Ã©l')",2
"there once more , through the panels opening into these caribbean waters ten meters below the surface of the waves , i found so many fascinating exhibits to describe in my daily notes ! among other zoophytes there were portuguese men - of - war known by the name physalia pelagica , like big , oblong bladders with a pearly sheen , spreading their membranes to the wind , letting their blue tentacles drift like silken threads ; to the eye delightful jellyfish , to the touch actual nettles that ooze a corrosive liquid . among the articulates there were annelid worms one and a half meters long , furnished with a pink proboscis , equipped with 1,700 organs of locomotion , snaking through the waters , and as they went , throwing off every gleam in the solar spectrum . from the fish branch there were manta rays , enormous cartilaginous fish ten feet long and weighing 600 pounds , their pectoral fin triangular , their midback slightly arched , their eyes attached to the edges of the face at the front of the head ; they floated like wreckage from a ship , sometimes fastening onto our windows like opaque shutters . there were american triggerfish for which nature has ground only black and white pigments , feather - shaped gobies that were long and plump with yellow fins and jutting jaws , sixteen - decimeter mackerel with short , sharp teeth , covered with small scales , and related to the albacore species . next came swarms of red mullet corseted in gold stripes from head to tail , their shining fins all aquiver , genuine masterpieces of jewelry , formerly sacred to the goddess diana , much in demand by rich romans , and about which the old saying goes : "" he who catches them does n't eat them ! "" finally , adorned with emerald ribbons and dressed in velvet and silk , golden angelfish passed before our eyes like courtiers in the paintings of veronese ; spurred gilthead stole by with their swift thoracic fins ; thread herring fifteen inches long were wrapped in their phosphorescent glimmers ; gray mullet thrashed the sea with their big fleshy tails ; red salmon seemed to mow the waves with their slicing pectorals ; and silver moonfish , worthy of their name , rose on the horizon of the waters like the whitish reflections of many moons .",30,"('-PRON-', 'mon', 'mi')",1
"how many other marvelous new specimens i still could have observed if , little by little , the nautilus had n't settled to the lower strata ! its slanting fins drew it to depths of 2,000 and 3,500 meters . there animal life was represented by nothing more than sea lilies , starfish , delightful crinoids with bell - shaped heads like little chalices on straight stems , top - shell snails , blood - red tooth shells , and fissurella snails , a large species of coastal mollusk .",27,"('-PRON-', 'son', 'su')",0

"it was a squid of colossal dimensions , fully eight meters long . it was traveling backward with tremendous speed in the same direction as the nautilus . it gazed with enormous , staring eyes that were tinted sea green . its eight arms ( or more accurately , feet ) were rooted in its head , which has earned these animals the name cephalopod ; its arms stretched a distance twice the length of its body and were writhing like the serpentine hair of the furies . you could plainly see its 250 suckers , arranged over the inner sides of its tentacles and shaped like semispheric capsules . sometimes these suckers fastened onto the lounge window by creating vacuums against it . the monster 's mouth -- a beak made of horn and shaped like that of a parrot -- opened and closed vertically . its tongue , also of horn substance and armed with several rows of sharp teeth , would flicker out from between these genuine shears . what a freak of nature ! a bird 's beak on a mollusk ! its body was spindle - shaped and swollen in the middle , a fleshy mass that must have weighed 20,000 to 25,000 kilograms . its unstable color would change with tremendous speed as the animal grew irritated , passing successively from bluish gray to reddish brown .",41,"('-PRON-', 'son', 'su')",0
"what was irritating this mollusk ? no doubt the presence of the nautilus , even more fearsome than itself , and which it could n't grip with its mandibles or the suckers on its arms . and yet what monsters these devilfish are , what vitality our creator has given them , what vigor in their movements , thanks to their owning a triple heart !",33,"('-PRON-', 'son', 'su')",0

"unshaken by these squalls , captain nemo stationed himself on the platform . he was lashed around the waist to withstand the monstrous breakers foaming over the deck . i hoisted and attached myself to the same place , dividing my wonderment between the storm and this incomparable man who faced it head - on .",40,"('-PRON-', 'mon', 'mi')",1
"the rain was followed by a downpour of fire . droplets of water changed into exploding tufts . you would have thought captain nemo was courting a death worthy of himself , seeking to be struck by lightning . in one hideous pitching movement , the nautilus reared its steel spur into the air like a lightning rod , and i saw long sparks shoot down it .",30,"('-PRON-', 'lui', 'Ã©l')",2

"the sea is of no great depth at the grand banks . a few hundred fathoms at best . but to the south there is a deep , suddenly occurring depression , a 3,000-meter pit . here the gulf stream widens . its waters come to full bloom . it loses its speed and temperature , but it turns into a sea .",42,"('-PRON-', 'son', 'su')",0
"among the fish that the nautilus startled on its way , i 'll mention a one - meter lumpfish , blackish on top with orange on the belly and rare among its brethren in that it practices monogamy , a good - sized eelpout , a type of emerald moray whose flavor is excellent , wolffish with big eyes in a head somewhat resembling a canine 's , viviparous blennies whose eggs hatch inside their bodies like those of snakes , bloated gobio ( or black gudgeon ) measuring two decimeters , grenadiers with long tails and gleaming with a silvery glow , speedy fish venturing far from their high arctic seas .",8,"('-PRON-', 'son', 'su')",0

"the operation proceeded apace . yet there was one hitch . as they gradually unrolled this third cable , the electricians observed on several occasions that someone had recently driven nails into it , trying to damage its core . captain anderson , his officers , and the engineers put their heads together , then posted a warning that if the culprit were detected , he would be thrown overboard without a trial . after that , these villainous attempts were not repeated .",43,"('-PRON-', 'son', 'su')",0
"by july 23 the great eastern was lying no farther than 800 kilometers from newfoundland when it received telegraphed news from ireland of an armistice signed between prussia and austria after the battle of sadova . through the mists on the 27th , it sighted the port of heart 's content . the undertaking had ended happily , and in its first dispatch , young america addressed old europe with these wise words so rarely understood : "" glory to god in the highest , and peace on earth to men of good will .

"there the ocean floor formed a valley 120 kilometers wide , into which you could fit mt . blanc without its summit poking above the surface of the waves . this valley is closed off to the east by a sheer wall 2,000 meters high . we arrived there on may 28 , and the nautilus lay no farther than 150 kilometers from ireland . would captain nemo head up north and beach us on the british isles ? no . much to my surprise , he went back down south and returned to european seas . as we swung around the emerald isle , i spotted cape clear for an instant , plus the lighthouse on fastnet rock that guides all those thousands of ships setting out from glasgow or liverpool .",20,"('-PRON-', 'son', 'su')",0
"an important question then popped into my head . would the nautilus dare to tackle the english channel ? ned land ( who promptly reappeared after we hugged shore ) never stopped questioning me . what could i answer him ? captain nemo remained invisible . after giving the canadian a glimpse of american shores , was he about to show me the coast of france ?",6,"('-PRON-', 'mon', 'mi')",1

' she was close behind it when she turned the corner , but the rabbit was no longer to be seen : she found herself in a long , low hall , which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof . there were doors all round the hall , but they were all locked ; and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other , trying every door , she walked sadly down the middle , wondering how she was ever to get out again .",31,"('-PRON-', 'lui', 'Ã©l')",2

"' you ought to be ashamed of yourself , ' said alice , ' a great girl like you , ' ( she might well say this ) , ' to go on crying in this way ! stop this moment , i tell you !

"as she said these words her foot slipped , and in another moment , splash ! she was up to her chin in salt water . her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea , ' and in that case i can go back by railway , ' she said to herself . ( alice had been to the seaside once in her life , and had come to the general conclusion , that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea , some children digging in the sand with wooden spades , then a row of lodging houses , and behind them a railway station . ) however , she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high .",66,"('-PRON-', 'son', 'su')",0
"' i wish i had n't cried so much ! ' said alice , as she swam about , trying to find her way out . ' i shall be punished for it now , i suppose , by being drowned in my own tears ! that will be a queer thing , to be sure ! however , everything is queer to - day . '",42,"('-PRON-', 'mon', 'mi')",1

"' mary ann ! mary ann ! ' said the voice . ' fetch me my gloves this moment !

"she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could , and waited till she heard a little animal ( she could n't guess of what sort it was ) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her : then , saying to herself ' this is bill , ' she gave one sharp kick , and waited to see what would happen next .",41,"('-PRON-', 'lui', 'Ã©l')",2
"so she swallowed one of the cakes , and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly . as soon as she was small enough to get through the door , she ran out of the house , and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside . the poor little lizard , bill , was in the middle , being held up by two guinea - pigs , who were giving it something out of a bottle . they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared ; but she ran off as hard as she could , and soon found herself safe in a thick wood .",92,"('-PRON-', 'lui', 'Ã©l')",2
"an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes , and feebly stretching out one paw , trying to touch her . ' poor little thing !

"alice thought she might as well wait , as she had nothing else to do , and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing . for some minutes it puffed away without speaking , but at last it unfolded its arms , took the hookah out of its mouth again , and said , ' so you think you 're changed , do you ?

"' there might be some sense in your knocking , ' the footman went on without attending to her , ' if we had the door between us . for instance , if you were inside , you might knock , and i could let you out , you know .

"alice caught the baby with some difficulty , as it was a queer- shaped little creature , and held out its arms and legs in all directions , ' just like a star - fish , ' thought alice . the poor little thing was snorting like a steam - engine when she caught it , and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again , so that altogether , for the first minute or two , it was as much as she could do to hold it .",52,"('-PRON-', 'lui', 'Ã©l')",2
"so she set the little creature down , and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood .

"five and seven said nothing , but looked at two . two began in a low voice , ' why the fact is , you see , miss , this here ought to have been a red rose - tree , and we put a white one in by mistake ; and if the queen was to find it out , we should all have our heads cut off , you know . so you see , miss , we 're doing our best , afore she comes , to-- ' at this moment five , who had been anxiously looking across the garden , called out ' the queen ! the queen !

"alice began to feel very uneasy : to be sure , she had not as yet had any dispute with the queen , but she knew that it might happen any minute , ' and then , ' thought she , ' what would become of me ? they 're dreadfully fond of beheading people here ; the great wonder is , that there 's any one left alive !

"alice waited till the eyes appeared , and then nodded . ' it 's no use speaking to it , ' she thought , ' till its ears have come , or at least one of them .

"the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog , which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other : the only difficulty was , that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden , where alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree .",33,"('-PRON-', 'son', 'su')",0
"by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back , the fight was over , and both the hedgehogs were out of sight : ' but it does n't matter much , ' thought alice , ' as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground .
