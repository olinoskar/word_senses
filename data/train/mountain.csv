"that night my sleep was fitful . hope and fear besieged me by turns . i got up several times . the nautilus continued groping . near three o'clock in the morning , i observed that we encountered the ice bank 's underbelly at a depth of only fifty meters . so only 150 feet separated us from the surface of the water . little by little the ice bank was turning into an ice field again . the mountains were changing back into plains .",79,"('mountain', 'montagne', 'montaña')",0
"the nautilus kept to its southeasterly heading . on december 1 it cut the equator at longitude 142 degrees , and on the 4th of the same month , after a quick crossing marked by no incident , we raised the marquesas islands . three miles off , in latitude 8 degrees 57 ' south and longitude 139 degrees 32 ' west , i spotted martin point on nuku hiva , chief member of this island group that belongs to france . i could make out only its wooded mountains on the horizon , because captain nemo hated to hug shore . there our nets brought up some fine fish samples : dolphinfish with azure fins , gold tails , and flesh that 's unrivaled in the entire world , wrasse from the genus hologymnosus that were nearly denuded of scales but exquisite in flavor , knifejaws with bony beaks , yellowish albacore that were as tasty as bonito , all fish worth classifying in the ship 's pantry .",89,"('mountain', 'montagne', 'montaña')",0
"the panorama of the islands , as they steamed by them , was superb . vast forests of palms , arecs , bamboo , teakwood , of the gigantic mimosa , and tree - like ferns covered the foreground , while behind , the graceful outlines of the mountains were traced against the sky ; and along the coasts swarmed by thousands the precious swallows whose nests furnish a luxurious dish to the tables of the celestial empire . the varied landscape afforded by the andaman islands was soon passed , however , and the rangoon rapidly approached the straits of malacca , which gave access to the china seas .",48,"('mountain', 'montagne', 'montaña')",0
"the mediterranean , your ideal blue sea : to greeks simply "" the sea , "" to hebrews "" the great sea , "" to romans mare nostrum . bordered by orange trees , aloes , cactus , and maritime pine trees , perfumed with the scent of myrtle , framed by rugged mountains , saturated with clean , transparent air but continuously under construction by fires in the earth , this sea is a genuine battlefield where neptune and pluto still struggle for world domination . here on these beaches and waters , says the french historian michelet , a man is revived by one of the most invigorating climates in the world .",53,"('mountain', 'montagne', 'montaña')",0
"loud peals of thunder broke , and could scarcely be distinguished from the rumblings of the mountain , whose mouth vomited forth ignited rocks , which , hurled to more than a thousand feet , burst in the air like shells .",16,"('mountain', 'montagne', 'montaña')",0
"it was only a large stream , deep and clear , formed of the mountain water , which , half river , half torrent , here rippling peacefully over the sand , there falling against the rocks or dashing down in a cascade , ran towards the lake , over a distance of a mile and a half , its breadth varying from thirty to forty feet .",14,"('mountain', 'montagne', 'montaña')",0
