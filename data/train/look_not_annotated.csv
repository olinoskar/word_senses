"looking down on this very scene , there stood upon the fourth of may , eighteen hundred and forty - seven , a solitary traveller . his appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region . an observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty . his face was lean and haggard , and the brown parchment - like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones ; his long , brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white ; his eyes were sunken in his head , and burned with an unnatural lustre ; while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton . as he stood , he leaned upon his weapon for support , and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution . his gaunt face , however , and his clothes , which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs , proclaimed what it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance . the man was dying — dying from hunger and from thirst .",0

"but more than that we were never destined to know , though there was much which we might surmise . there was no chance of finding footsteps in the mire , for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon them , but as we at last reached firmer ground beyond the morass we all looked eagerly for them . but no slightest sign of them ever met our eyes . if the earth told a true story , then stapleton never reached that island of refuge towards which he struggled through the fog upon that last night . somewhere in the heart of the great grimpen mire , down in the foul slime of the huge morass which had sucked him in , this cold and cruel - hearted man is forever buried .",54
"from the bosom of his robe he then produced a casket , opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and earrings ; she acted astonishment and admiration ; kneeling , he laid the treasure at her feet ; incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks and gestures ; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the rings in her ears .",44

"mr . fogg left the hotel alone , after giving passepartout instructions to await his return , and inform aouda to be ready at an instant 's notice . he proceeded to the banks of the hudson , and looked about among the vessels moored or anchored in the river , for any that were about to depart . several had departure signals , and were preparing to put to sea at morning tide ; for in this immense and admirable port there is not one day in a hundred that vessels do not set out for every quarter of the globe . but they were mostly sailing vessels , of which , of course , phileas fogg could make no use .",39

"on closer examination , you detected something in his face that displeased , or rather that failed to please . his features were regular , but too relaxed : his eye was large and well cut , but the life looking out of it was a tame , vacant life -- at least so i thought . the sound of the dressing - bell dispersed the party .",40
"but i liked his physiognomy even less than before : it struck me as being at the same time unsettled and inanimate . his eye wandered , and had no meaning in its wandering : this gave him an odd look , such as i never remembered to have seen .",40
"for a handsome and not an unamiable - looking man , he repelled me exceedingly : there was no power in that smooth - skinned face of a full oval shape : no firmness in that aquiline nose and small cherry mouth ; there was no thought on the low , even forehead ; no command in that blank , brown eye .",8
"the queen entered the great hall ; and it was remarked that , like the king , she looked dull and even weary .",18

"i took one last look at the natural wonders and artistic treasures amassed in the museum , this unrivaled collection doomed to perish someday in the depths of the seas , together with its curator . i wanted to establish one supreme impression in my mind . i stayed there an hour , basking in the aura of the ceiling lights , passing in review the treasures shining in their glass cases . then i returned to my stateroom . there i dressed in sturdy seafaring clothes . i gathered my notes and packed them tenderly about my person . my heart was pounding mightily . i could n't curb its pulsations . my anxiety and agitation would certainly have given me away if captain nemo had seen me .",4

"but the clerks were not the dupes of this deceit , and their lugubrious looks settled down into resigned countenances .",14

the king looked at the cardinal as if to interrogate him ; but he had not time to address any question to him -- a cry of admiration burst from every mouth .,2

"but as beautiful as it was , i could get only a quick look at this basin whose surface area comprises 2,000,000 square kilometers . even captain nemo 's personal insights were denied me , because that mystifying individual did n't appear one single time during our high - speed crossing . i estimate that the nautilus covered a track of some 600 leagues under the waves of this sea , and this voyage was accomplished in just twenty - four hours times two . departing from the waterways of greece on the morning of february 16 , we cleared the strait of gibraltar by sunrise on the 18th .",13

""" harry , "" said basil hallward , looking him straight in the face , "" every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist , not of the sitter . the sitter is merely the accident , the occasion . it is not he who is revealed by the painter ; it is rather the painter who , on the coloured canvas , reveals himself . the reason i will not exhibit this picture is that i am afraid that i have shown in it the secret of my own soul .

"in the midst of the watery mass , brightly lit by our electric beams , there snaked past those one - meter lampreys that are common to nearly every clime . a type of ray from the genus oxyrhynchus , five feet wide , had a white belly with a spotted , ash - gray back and was carried along by the currents like a huge , wide - open shawl . other rays passed by so quickly i could n't tell if they deserved that name "" eagle ray "" coined by the ancient greeks , or those designations of "" rat ray , "" "" bat ray , "" and "" toad ray "" that modern fishermen have inflicted on them . dogfish known as topes , twelve feet long and especially feared by divers , were racing with each other . looking like big bluish shadows , thresher sharks went by , eight feet long and gifted with an extremely acute sense of smell . dorados from the genus sparus , some measuring up to thirteen decimeters , appeared in silver and azure costumes encircled with ribbons , which contrasted with the dark color of their fins ; fish sacred to the goddess venus , their eyes set in brows of gold ; a valuable species that patronizes all waters fresh or salt , equally at home in rivers , lakes , and oceans , living in every clime , tolerating any temperature , their line dating back to prehistoric times on this earth yet preserving all its beauty from those far - off days . magnificent sturgeons , nine to ten meters long and extremely fast , banged their powerful tails against the glass of our panels , showing bluish backs with small brown spots ; they resemble sharks , without equaling their strength , and are encountered in every sea ; in the spring they delight in swimming up the great rivers , fighting the currents of the volga , danube , po , rhine , loire , and oder , while feeding on herring , mackerel , salmon , and codfish ; although they belong to the class of cartilaginous fish , they rate as a delicacy ; they 're eaten fresh , dried , marinated , or salt - preserved , and in olden times they were borne in triumph to the table of the roman epicure lucullus . but whenever the nautilus drew near the surface , those denizens of the mediterranean i could observe most productively belonged to the sixty - third genus of bony fish . these were tuna from the genus scomber , blue - black on top , silver on the belly armor , their dorsal stripes giving off a golden gleam . they are said to follow ships in search of refreshing shade from the hot tropical sun , and they did just that with the nautilus , as they had once done with the vessels of the count de la pérouse . for long hours they competed in speed with our submersible . i could n't stop marveling at these animals so perfectly cut out for racing , their heads small , their bodies sleek , spindle - shaped , and in some cases over three meters long , their pectoral fins gifted with remarkable strength , their caudal fins forked . like certain flocks of birds , whose speed they equal , these tuna swim in triangle formation , which prompted the ancients to say they 'd boned up on geometry and military strategy . and yet they ca n't escape the provençal fishermen , who prize them as highly as did the ancient inhabitants of turkey and italy ; and these valuable animals , as oblivious as if they were deaf and blind , leap right into the marseilles tuna nets and perish by the thousands .",144
