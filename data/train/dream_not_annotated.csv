"the next day bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her little sister . of late i had often recalled this saying and this incident ; for during the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not brought with it a dream of an infant , which i sometimes hushed in my arms , sometimes dandled on my knee , sometimes watched playing with daisies on a lawn , or again , dabbling its hands in running water .",48
"after a few moments of silence , which none of us would have dreamed of interrupting :",13
"well , did anybody ever dream of calling aramis a coward ?",5
"a quarter of an hour afterwards , amidst an extraordinary turmoil of applause , sibyl vane stepped on to the stage . yes , she was certainly lovely to look at-- one of the loveliest creatures , lord henry thought , that he had ever seen . there was something of the fawn in her shy grace and startled eyes . a faint blush , like the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver , came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded enthusiastic house . she stepped back a few paces and her lips seemed to tremble . basil hallward leaped to his feet and began to applaud . motionless , and as one in a dream , sat dorian gray , gazing at her . lord henry peered through his glasses , murmuring , "" charming ! charming ! """,121
"but her sister sat still just as she left her , leaning her head on her hand , watching the setting sun , and thinking of little alice and all her wonderful adventures , till she too began dreaming after a fashion , and this was her dream:--",38
"i stayed in my stateroom . i wanted to avoid the captain , to hide from his eyes the agitation overwhelming me . what an agonizing day i spent , torn between my desire to regain my free will and my regret at abandoning this marvelous nautilus , leaving my underwater research incomplete ! how could i relinquish this ocean--""my own atlantic , "" as i liked to call it -- without observing its lower strata , without wresting from it the kinds of secrets that had been revealed to me by the seas of the east indies and the pacific ! i was putting down my novel half read , i was waking up as my dream neared its climax ! how painfully the hours passed , as i sometimes envisioned myself safe on shore with my companions , or , despite my better judgment , as i sometimes wished that some unforeseen circumstances would prevent ned land from carrying out his plans .",117
"gentle , soft dream , nestling in my arms now , you will fly , too , as your sisters have all fled before you : but kiss me before you go -- embrace me , jane . """,3
"as he often remembered afterwards , and always with no small wonder , he found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost scientific interest . that such a change should have taken place was incredible to him . and yet it was a fact . was there some subtle affinity between the chemical atoms that shaped themselves into form and colour on the canvas and the soul that was within him ? could it be that what that soul thought , they realized?--that what it dreamed , they made true ? or was there some other , more terrible reason ? he shuddered , and felt afraid , and , going back to the couch , lay there , gazing at the picture in sickened horror .",90

"i dreamed it would be nameless bliss , as i loved , loved to be ; and to this object did i press as blind as eagerly .",1
"on sped my rainbow , fast as light ; i flew as in a dream ; for glorious rose upon my sight that child of shower and gleam .",14
"three seconds before the arrival of j. b. hobson 's letter , i no more dreamed of chasing the unicorn than of trying for the northwest passage . three seconds after reading this letter from the honorable secretary of the navy , i understood at last that my true vocation , my sole purpose in life , was to hunt down this disturbing monster and rid the world of it .",15
"i was transported in thought to the scenes of childhood : i dreamt i lay in the red - room at gateshead ; that the night was dark , and my mind impressed with strange fears . the light that long ago had struck me into syncope , recalled in this vision , seemed glidingly to mount the wall , and tremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured ceiling .",12
so i answered after i had waked from the trance - like dream .,12
ned land could n't conceal his glee . he was a prisoner escaping from prison and never dreaming he would need to reenter it .,17
"when i consulted the chart an hour later , i saw that the nautilus 's position was marked at longitude 16 degrees 17 ' and latitude 33 degrees 22 ' , a good 150 leagues from the nearest coast . it would n't do to even dream of escaping , and i 'll let the reader decide how promptly the canadian threw a tantrum when i ventured to tell him our situation .",46
""" you , sir , are the most phantom - like of all : you are a mere dream . """,18
"meanwhile the reddish light guiding us had expanded and inflamed the horizon . the presence of this furnace under the waters had me extremely puzzled . was it some sort of electrical discharge ? was i approaching some natural phenomenon still unknown to scientists on shore ? or , rather ( and this thought did cross my mind ) , had the hand of man intervened in that blaze ? had human beings fanned those flames ? in these deep strata would i meet up with more of captain nemo 's companions , friends he was about to visit who led lives as strange as his own ? would i find a whole colony of exiles down here , men tired of the world 's woes , men who had sought and found independence in the ocean 's lower depths ? all these insane , inadmissible ideas dogged me , and in this frame of mind , continually excited by the series of wonders passing before my eyes , i would n't have been surprised to find on this sea bottom one of those underwater towns captain nemo dreamed about !",188
"supper was rapidly devoured , and the little company housed themselves as best they could . the bed was hard , the shelter not very substantial , and our position an anxious one , at five thousand feet above the sea level . yet i slept particularly well ; it was one of the best nights i had ever had , and i did not even dream .",66
"last january , rid of all mistresses -- in a harsh , bitter frame of mind , the result of a useless , roving , lonely life -- corroded with disappointment , sourly disposed against all men , and especially against all womankind ( for i began to regard the notion of an intellectual , faithful , loving woman as a mere dream ) , recalled by business , i came back to england .",62
just now we ca n't even dream of returning to france . travel between upper norway and the south is limited . so i have to wait for the arrival of a steamboat that provides bimonthly service from north cape .,6
"i looked upon the scene before me — upon the mere house , and the simple landscape features of the domain — upon the bleak walls — upon the vacant eye - like windows — upon a few rank sedges — and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees — with an utter depression of soul which i can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after - dream of the reveller upon opium — the bitter lapse into every - day life — the hideous dropping off of the veil .",72
"as i mused in this way , trying to establish in my memory every detail of this impressive landscape , captain nemo was leaning his elbows on a moss - covered monument , motionless as if petrified in some mute trance . was he dreaming of those lost generations , asking them for the secret of human destiny ? was it here that this strange man came to revive himself , basking in historical memories , reliving that bygone life , he who had no desire for our modern one ? i would have given anything to know his thoughts , to share them , understand them !",44
"i was glad when it ceased . on sleeping , i continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night . i continued also the wish to be with you , and experienced a strange , regretful consciousness of some barrier dividing us .",13
""" and these dreams weigh on your spirits now , jane , when i am close to you ? little nervous subject !",3
"no ! the storm did not abate , and neither jonathan forster nor his companions dreamed of confronting it in that frail car .",15
""" i dreamt another dream , sir : that thornfield hall was a dreary ruin , the retreat of bats and owls . i thought that of all the stately front nothing remained but a shell - like wall , very high and very fragile - looking . i wandered , on a moonlight night , through the grass- grown enclosure within : here i stumbled over a marble hearth , and there over a fallen fragment of cornice .",2

"he shuddered , and for a moment he regretted that he had not told basil the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away . basil would have helped him to resist lord henry 's influence , and the still more poisonous influences that came from his own temperament . the love that he bore him -- for it was really love-- had nothing in it that was not noble and intellectual . it was not that mere physical admiration of beauty that is born of the senses and that dies when the senses tire . it was such love as michelangelo had known , and montaigne , and winckelmann , and shakespeare himself . yes , basil could have saved him . but it was too late now . the past could always be annihilated . regret , denial , or forgetfulness could do that . but the future was inevitable . there were passions in him that would find their terrible outlet , dreams that would make the shadow of their evil real .",168

"his eye fell on the yellow book that lord henry had sent him . what was it , he wondered . he went towards the little , pearl - coloured octagonal stand that had always looked to him like the work of some strange egyptian bees that wrought in silver , and taking up the volume , flung himself into an arm - chair and began to turn over the leaves . after a few minutes he became absorbed . it was the strangest book that he had ever read . it seemed to him that in exquisite raiment , and to the delicate sound of flutes , the sins of the world were passing in dumb show before him . things that he had dimly dreamed of were suddenly made real to him . things of which he had never dreamed were gradually revealed .",126

"it was a poisonous book . the heavy odour of incense seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain . the mere cadence of the sentences , the subtle monotony of their music , so full as it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately repeated , produced in the mind of the lad , as he passed from chapter to chapter , a form of reverie , a malady of dreaming , that made him unconscious of the falling day and creeping shadows .",74
"his warm and fickle imagination , which in gascony had rendered formidable to young chambermaids , and even sometimes their mistresses , had never dreamed , even in moments of delirium , of half the amorous wonders or a quarter of the feats of gallantry which were here set forth in connection with names the best known and with details the least concealed .",24
"we were stretched out in this delightful cave for an hour . our conversation , lively at the outset , then languished . a definite drowsiness overcame us . since i saw no good reason to resist the call of sleep , i fell into a heavy doze . i dreamed -- one does n't choose his dreams -- that my life had been reduced to the vegetating existence of a simple mollusk . it seemed to me that this cave made up my double - valved shell . . . .",50

"passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie . up to his arrival at bombay , he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there ; but , now that they were plainly whirling across india at full speed , a sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams . his old vagabond nature returned to him ; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took possession of him . he came to regard his master 's project as intended in good earnest , believed in the reality of the bet , and therefore in the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail within the designated period . already he began to worry about possible delays , and accidents which might happen on the way . he recognised himself as being personally interested in the wager , and trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable folly of the night before . being much less cool - headed than mr . fogg , he was much more restless , counting and recounting the days passed over , uttering maledictions when the train stopped , and accusing it of sluggishness , and mentally blaming mr . fogg for not having bribed the engineer . the worthy fellow was ignorant that , while it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer , it could not be done on the railway .",50
