"in search of a place proper for this , i found a little plain on the side of a rising hill , whose front towards this little plain was steep as a house - side , so that nothing could come down upon me from the top . on the one side of the rock there was a hollow place , worn a little way in , like the entrance or door of a cave but there was not really any cave or way into the rock at all .",19
"i endeavored to believe that much , if not all of what i felt , was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the room — of the dark and tattered draperies , which , tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest , swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls , and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed .",46
"hans pointed with his finger at a dark mass six hundred yards away , rising and falling alternately with heavy plunges . i looked and cried :",14
"and in fact two liquid columns were rising to a considerable height above the sea . we stood amazed , thunderstruck , at the presence of such a herd of marine monsters . they were of supernatural dimensions ; the smallest of them would have crunched our raft , crew and all , at one snap of its huge jaws . hans wants to tack to get away from this dangerous neighbourhood ; but he sees on the other hand enemies not less terrible ; a tortoise forty feet long , and a serpent of thirty , lifting its fearful head and gleaming eyes above the flood .",7
flight was out of the question now . the reptiles rose ; they wheeled around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express trains . they described around us gradually narrowing circles . i took up my rifle . but what could a ball do against the scaly armour with which these enormous beasts were clad ?,10
"on the contrary this was a uniform mass of verdure , out of which rose two or three hills of no great height .",14
"the plesiosaurus , a serpent with a cylindrical body and a short tail , has four flappers or paddles to act like oars . its body is entirely covered with a thick armour of scales , and its neck , as flexible as a swan 's , rises thirty feet above the waves .",47
"the sailor ascertained that at this time -- that is to say , at low tide , when the rising floods did not reach it -- it was sweet .",19
""" yes , yes ! "" he cried . "" i see a vast inverted cone rising from the surface . """,16
"suddenly hans rises , and pointing with his finger at the menacing object , he says :",2
"and if nothing happens without his knowledge , he knows that i am here , and am in this dreadful condition ; and if nothing happens without his appointment , he has appointed all this to befall me . nothing occurred to my thought to contradict any of these conclusions , and therefore it rested upon me with the greater force , that it must needs be that god had appointed all this to befall me ; that i was brought into this miserable circumstance by his direction , he having the sole power , not of me only , but of everything that happened in the world . immediately it followed : why has god done this to me ? what have i done to be thus used ? my conscience presently checked me in that inquiry , as if i had blasphemed , and methought it spoke to me like a voice : “ wretch ! dost _ thou _ ask what thou hast done ? look back upon a dreadful misspent life , and ask thyself what thou hast _ not _ done ? ask , why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed ? why wert thou not drowned in yarmouth roads ; killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the sallee man - of - war ; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of africa ; or drowned _ here _ , when all the crew perished but thyself ? dost _ thou _ ask , what have i done ? ” i was struck dumb with these reflections , as one astonished , and had not a word to say — no , not to answer to myself , but rose up pensive and sad , walked back to my retreat , and went up over my wall , as if i had been going to bed ; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed , and i had no inclination to sleep ; so i sat down in my chair , and lighted my lamp , for it began to be dark . now , as the apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me very much , it occurred to my thought that the brazilians take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers , and i had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests , which was quite cured , and some also that was green , and not quite cured .",293

"_ friday , august 21_.--on the morrow the magnificent geyser has disappeared . the wind has risen , and has rapidly carried us away from axel island . the roarings become lost in the distance .",16
"there was another tree and a little thicket beyond it , about fifty yards nearer to them than the place where i was , which , by going a little way about , i saw i might come at undiscovered , and that then i should be within half a shot of them ; so i withheld my passion , though i was indeed enraged to the highest degree ; and going back about twenty paces , i got behind some bushes , which held all the way till i came to the other tree , and then came to a little rising ground , which gave me a full view of them at the distance of about eighty yards .",102
"' in that case , ' said the dodo solemnly , rising to its feet , ' i move that the meeting adjourn , for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies-- '",11
""" then do not let us lose time , "" said herbert , rising .",13
"but as the bushes shrank , the tree forms magnified . actual petrified thickets and long alcoves from some fantastic school of architecture kept opening up before our steps . captain nemo entered beneath a dark gallery whose gentle slope took us to a depth of 100 meters . the light from our glass coils produced magical effects at times , lingering on the wrinkled roughness of some natural arch , or some overhang suspended like a chandelier , which our lamps flecked with fiery sparks . amid these shrubs of precious coral , i observed other polyps no less unusual : melita coral , rainbow coral with jointed outgrowths , then a few tufts of genus corallina , some green and others red , actually a type of seaweed encrusted with limestone salts , which , after long disputes , naturalists have finally placed in the vegetable kingdom . but as one intellectual has remarked , "" here , perhaps , is the actual point where life rises humbly out of slumbering stone , but without breaking away from its crude starting point .

"during that day a fearsome school of sharks provided us with an escort . dreadful animals that teem in these seas and make them extremely dangerous . there were port jackson sharks with a brown back , a whitish belly , and eleven rows of teeth , bigeye sharks with necks marked by a large black spot encircled in white and resembling an eye , and isabella sharks whose rounded snouts were strewn with dark speckles . often these powerful animals rushed at the lounge window with a violence less than comforting . by this point ned land had lost all self - control . he wanted to rise to the surface of the waves and harpoon the monsters , especially certain smooth - hound sharks whose mouths were paved with teeth arranged like a mosaic , and some big five - meter tiger sharks that insisted on personally provoking him . but the nautilus soon picked up speed and easily left astern the fastest of these man - eaters .",108
""" i daresay you hardly remember me , miss , "" he said , rising as i entered ; "" but my name is leaven : i lived coachman with mrs . reed when you were at gateshead , eight or nine years since , and i live there still . """,14
"buckingham pressed his lips passionately to that beautiful hand , and then rising , said , "" within six months , if i am not dead , i shall have seen you again , madame -- even if i have to overturn the world . """,12
"mrs . reed was rather a stout woman ; but , on hearing this strange and audacious declaration , she ran nimbly up the stair , swept me like a whirlwind into the nursery , and crushing me down on the edge of my crib , dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place , or utter one syllable during the remainder of the day .",53
"the latter rose from the front of the window , upon the sill of which he had leaned with his elbow , and knitted his brow like a man disquieted .",2
"my credit rises by the fall of that of the comte de wardes . """,2
"at six o'clock the day broke suddenly , with that speed unique to tropical regions , which experience no real dawn or dusk . the sun 's rays pierced the cloud curtain gathered on the easterly horizon , and the radiant orb rose swiftly .",42
"the waters of the mercy flowed under a roof of ice , which , at each rising and ebbing of the tide , broke up with loud crashes .",16
"on the left bank , the ground , which was flat and marshy , rose imperceptibly towards the interior .",14
"like a covey of snipe over a marsh , there rose underfoot schools of unusual fish from the genus monopterus , whose members have no fin but their tail . i recognized the javanese eel , a genuine eight - decimeter serpent with a bluish gray belly , which , without the gold lines over its flanks , could easily be confused with the conger eel . from the butterfish genus , whose oval bodies are very flat , i observed several adorned in brilliant colors and sporting a dorsal fin like a sickle , edible fish that , when dried and marinated , make an excellent dish known by the name "" karawade "" ; then some sea poachers , fish belonging to the genus aspidophoroides , whose bodies are covered with scaly armor divided into eight lengthwise sections .",10
"however , the snow soon disappeared , quickly dissolving under the influence of the rising temperature .",14
"and he pointed to a thick smoke rising from the mill , the sheds , and the buildings at the poultry - yard .",7
"but we could n't stop . we had to follow the captain , who headed down trails seemingly known only to himself . the seafloor rose noticeably , and when i lifted my arms , sometimes they would pass above the surface of the sea . then the level of the oysterbank would lower unpredictably . often we went around tall , pointed rocks rising like pyramids . in their dark crevices huge crustaceans , aiming their long legs like heavy artillery , watched us with unblinking eyes , while underfoot there crept millipedes , bloodworms , aricia worms , and annelid worms , whose antennas and tubular tentacles were incredibly long .",64
i rose .,1
"the hunters then rose , and using their sticks like scythes , they mowed down whole rows of these couroucous , who never thought of flying away , and stupidly allowed themselves to be knocked off .",3
"meanwhile ned land pulled the captain clear . uninjured , the latter stood up , went right to the indian , quickly cut the rope binding the man to his stone , took the fellow in his arms , and with a vigorous kick of the heel , rose to the surface of the sea .",48
"still the temperature kept rising , and i felt myself steeped in a broiling atmosphere . i could only compare it to the heat of a furnace at the moment when the molten metal is running into the mould . gradually we had been obliged to throw aside our coats and waistcoats , the lightest covering became uncomfortable and even painful .",4

"i knew quite well that according to the best received theories the mineral covering of the globe is never at absolute rest ; the changes brought about by the chemical decomposition of its component parts , the agitation caused by great liquid torrents , and the magnetic currents , are continually tending to disturb it -- even when living beings upon its surface may fancy that all is quiet below . a phenomenon of this kind would not have greatly alarmed me , or at any rate it would not have given rise to dreadful apprehensions .",92

"at the sight of his friend , porthos uttered a loud cry of joy ; and mousqueton , rising respectfully , yielded his place to him , and went to give an eye to the two stewpans , of which he appeared to have the particular inspection .",18

"the next day , february 10 , several ships appeared , running on our opposite tack . the nautilus resumed its underwater navigating ; but at the moment of our noon sights , the sea was deserted and the ship rose again to its waterline .",40

"just as they rose from table , in came four serene highnesses , who had also been stripped of their territories by the fortune of war , and had come to spend the remainder of the carnival at venice . candide took no manner of notice of them ; for his thoughts were wholly employed on his voyage to constantinople , where he intended to go in search of his lovely miss cunegund .",3
