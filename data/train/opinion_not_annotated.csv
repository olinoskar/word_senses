"indoors we agreed equally well . they were both more accomplished and better read than i was ; but with eagerness i followed in the path of knowledge they had trodden before me . i devoured the books they lent me : then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what i had perused during the day . thought fitted thought ; opinion met opinion : we coincided , in short , perfectly .",66

"it is true that this theory met with a most obstinate opponent in m. elie de beaumont . this high authority maintained that the soil of moulin quignon was not diluvial at all , but was of much more recent formation ; and , agreeing in that with cuvier , he refused to admit that the human species could be contemporary with the animals of the quaternary period . my uncle liedenbrock , along with the great body of the geologists , had maintained his ground , disputed , and argued , until m. elie de beaumont stood almost alone in his opinion .",102
""" however , we shall see , "" replied pencroft , "" and i am anxious to know what opinion captain harding will have of our savage .",19
"the rest of the day was passed in calculations and in conversations . i remained a steadfast adherent of the opinions of professor liedenbrock , and i envied the stolid indifference of hans , who , without going into causes and effects , went on with his eyes shut wherever his destiny guided him .",20
""" and you , my boy , give us your opinion , "" said the engineer , turning to herbert .",10
""" ye gods , "" conseil replied , "" i hardly know what to tell master . we 're certainly seeing some unusual things , and for two months we 've had no time for boredom . the latest wonder is always the most astonishing , and if this progression keeps up , i ca n't imagine what its climax will be . in my opinion , we 'll never again have such an opportunity .

"public opinion being pronounced , the states of the union were the first in the field . in new york preparations were under way for an expedition designed to chase this narwhale . a high - speed frigate , the abraham lincoln , was fitted out for putting to sea as soon as possible . the naval arsenals were unlocked for commander farragut , who pressed energetically forward with the arming of his frigate .",1
impossible to reply to this in the affirmative : my little world held a contrary opinion : i was silent .,15
athos counseled d’artagnan to dismiss the fellow ; porthos was of opinion that he should give him a good thrashing first ; and aramis contended that a master should never attend to anything but the civilities paid to him .,11
"at length he determined in favor of a poor scholar , who had labored ten years for the booksellers at amsterdam : being of opinion that no employment could be more detestable .",24
"the result of these reflections was that d’artagnan , without asking information of any kind , alighted , commended the horses to the care of his lackey , entered a small room destined to receive those who wished to be alone , and desired the host to bring him a bottle of his best wine and as good a breakfast as possible -- a desire which further corroborated the high opinion the innkeeper had formed of the traveler at first sight .",70
""" and pray , "" said he to martin , "" what is your opinion of the whole of this system ? what notion have you of moral and natural evil ? """,14
""" hum ! "" observed the reporter , who had not given any decided opinion .",14
"again she regarded me so icily , i felt at once that her opinion of me -- her feeling towards me -- was unchanged and unchangeable .",13
"candide listened to this discourse with great attention , and conceived a high opinion of the person who delivered it ; and as the marchioness had taken care to place him near her side , he took the liberty to whisper her softly in the ear and ask who this person was that spoke so well .",13
""" oh the great man , "" cried candide , "" he is a second pangloss . "" then turning towards him , "" sir , "" said he , "" you are doubtless of opinion that everything is for the best in the physical and moral world , and that nothing could be otherwise than it is ? """,35
"the sailor considered the apparatus ; then he gazed at the engineer without saying a word , only a look plainly expressed his opinion that if cyrus harding was not a magician , he was certainly no ordinary man .",23

"yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many his strange and dangerous charm . his great wealth was a certain element of security . society -- civilized society , at least-- is never very ready to believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and fascinating . it feels instinctively that manners are of more importance than morals , and , in its opinion , the highest respectability is of much less value than the possession of a good chef . and , after all , it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has given one a bad dinner , or poor wine , is irreproachable in his private life . even the cardinal virtues can not atone for half - cold entrées , as lord henry remarked once , in a discussion on the subject , and there is possibly a good deal to be said for his view . for the canons of good society are , or should be , the same as the canons of art . form is absolutely essential to it . it should have the dignity of a ceremony , as well as its unreality , and should combine the insincere character of a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us . is insincerity such a terrible thing ? i think not . it is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities .",69
""" then , it is your opinion that our friend has perished in the waves ? "" again asked the reporter .",6

""" the flame flickers in the eye ; the eye shines like dew ; it looks soft and full of feeling ; it smiles at my jargon : it is susceptible ; impression follows impression through its clear sphere ; where it ceases to smile , it is sad ; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid : that signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness . it turns from me ; it will not suffer further scrutiny ; it seems to deny , by a mocking glance , the truth of the discoveries i have already made,--to disown the charge both of sensibility and chagrin : its pride and reserve only confirm me in my opinion .",114

""" you see , axel , "" he added , "" the condition of the terrestrial nucleus has given rise to various hypotheses among geologists ; there is no proof at all for this internal heat ; my opinion is that there is no such thing , it can not be ; besides we shall see for ourselves , and , like arne saknussemm , we shall know exactly what to hold as truth concerning this grand question .

""" and she is not to be despised , in my opinion . """,11
"this was said with a careless , abstracted indifference , which showed that my solicitude was , at least in his opinion , wholly superfluous .",21
"yes , a dangerous matter — so dangerous that even the most saintly dared only whisper their religious opinions with bated breath , lest something which fell from their lips might be misconstrued , and bring down a swift retribution upon them . the victims of persecution had now turned persecutors on their own account , and persecutors of the most terrible description . not the inquisition of seville , nor the german vehm - gericht , nor the secret societies of italy , were ever able to put a more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over the state of utah .",18
it was very evident that no decided opinion could be pronounced on this question until after a complete exploration of the island .,7
"mr . miles , the master , affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home ; but the mother 's heart turned from an opinion so harsh , and inclined rather to the more refined idea that john 's sallowness was owing to over - application and , perhaps , to pining after home .",34
"now , as the debate between these two nobles might last a long time , each becoming , naturally , more firm in his own opinion , m. de treville thought of an expedient which might terminate it quietly . this was to go himself to m. de la tremouille .",25
"whatever might be the sailor 's opinion , the expedition projected by the engineer was settled for the next day .",6
"these opinions he delivered in a few words , in a quiet , low voice ; and added , after a pause , in the tone of a man little accustomed to expansive comment , "" rather an unusual physiognomy ; certainly , not indicative of vulgarity or degradation . """,1
