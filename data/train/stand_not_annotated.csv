"and so it turned out . the nautilus took full advantage of this countercurrent . it advanced swiftly through this narrow passageway . for an instant i could glimpse the wonderful ruins of the temple of hercules , buried undersea , as pliny and avianus have mentioned , together with the flat island they stand on ; and a few minutes later , we were floating on the waves of the atlantic .",54

""" the man was elderly and infirm . we can understand his taking an evening stroll , but the ground was damp and the night inclement . is it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes , as dr . mortimer , with more practical sense than i should have given him credit for , deduced from the cigar ash ?

"he put out his hand with a quick gesture , but not seeing where i stood , he did not touch me .",15

""" now is my time to make peace with this gallant man , "" said d’artagnan to himself , having stood on one side during the whole of the latter part of the conversation ; and with this good feeling drawing near to aramis , who was departing without paying any attention to him , "" monsieur , "" said he , "" you will excuse me , i hope .

"as usual , dinner was served me in my stateroom . full of anxiety , i ate little . i left the table at seven o'clock . 120 minutes-- i was keeping track of them -- still separated me from the moment i was to rejoin ned land . my agitation increased . my pulse was throbbing violently . i could n't stand still . i walked up and down , hoping to calm my troubled mind with movement . the possibility of perishing in our reckless undertaking was the least of my worries ; my heart was pounding at the thought that our plans might be discovered before we had left the nautilus , at the thought of being hauled in front of captain nemo and finding him angered , or worse , saddened by my deserting him .",62

"it is true that the old house stood slightly off the perpendicular , and bulged out a little towards the street ; its roof sloped a little to one side , like the cap over the left ear of a tugendbund student ; its lines wanted accuracy ; but after all , it stood firm , thanks to an old elm which buttressed it in front , and which often in spring sent its young sprays through the window panes .",7

"now then , although the latter hypothesis was completely admissible , it could n't stand up to inquiries conducted in both the new world and the old . that a private individual had such a mechanism at his disposal was less than probable . where and when had he built it , and how could he have built it in secret ?",14

"when we got back , it was after moonrise : a pony , which we knew to be the surgeon 's , was standing at the garden door . mary ann remarked that she supposed some one must be very ill , as mr . bates had been sent for at that time of the evening .",23
"for nearly ten minutes he stood there , motionless , with parted lips and eyes strangely bright . he was dimly conscious that entirely fresh influences were at work within him . yet they seemed to him to have come really from himself . the few words that basil 's friend had said to him -- words spoken by chance , no doubt , and with wilful paradox in them-- had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before , but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses .",5
"and then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had been infused into it concerning heaven and hell ; and for the first time it recoiled , baffled ; and for the first time glancing behind , on each side , and before it , it saw all round an unfathomed gulf : it felt the one point where it stood -- the present ; all the rest was formless cloud and vacant depth ; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering , and plunging amid that chaos .",63

"the captain stood up and invited me to follow him . i 'd had time to collect myself . i did so . the lounge was dark , but the sea 's waves sparkled through the transparent windows . i stared .",2
"dorian gray frowned and turned his head away . he could not help liking the tall , graceful young man who was standing by him . his romantic , olive - coloured face and worn expression interested him . there was something in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating . his cool , white , flowerlike hands , even , had a curious charm . they moved , as he spoke , like music , and seemed to have a language of their own .",22
"felton remained standing , motionless and undecided .",2
"in the meantime , porthos had come up , waved his hand to athos , and then turning toward d’artagnan , stood quite astonished .",21

"miss temple , through all changes , had thus far continued superintendent of the seminary : to her instruction i owed the best part of my acquirements ; her friendship and society had been my continual solace ; she had stood me in the stead of mother , governess , and , latterly , companion .",40
"in the midst of the stone mazes furrowing this atlantic seafloor , captain nemo moved forward without hesitation . he knew this dark path . no doubt he had often traveled it and was incapable of losing his way . i followed him with unshakeable confidence . he seemed like some spirit of the sea , and as he walked ahead of me , i marveled at his tall figure , which stood out in black against the glowing background of the horizon .",72
"how i wished sleep would silence her . it seemed as if , could i but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as i stood at the window , some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief .",29
"a lad of fourteen , with a bright , keen face , had obeyed the summons of the manager . he stood now gazing with great reverence at the famous detective .",21
"the water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his dependence ; just as if a royal eagle , chained to a perch , should be forced to entreat a sparrow to become its purveyor .",2
"just then the moon appeared for an instant through the watery mass , casting a few pale rays over this submerged continent . it was only a fleeting glimmer , but its effect was indescribable . the captain stood up and took one last look at these immense plains ; then his hand signaled me to follow him .",38
"these words redoubled the eagerness of d’artagnan , who urged his horse , though he stood in need of no incitement , and they proceeded at a rapid pace .",15
"felton turned his eyes toward the part of the wall of the apartment before which he had found milady standing in the armchair in which she was now seated , and over her head he perceived a gilt - headed screw , fixed in the wall for the purpose of hanging up clothes or weapons .",19
"by the fire stood a little fellow of three years old , in plaid frock and trousers .",3
the blast blew so strong i could not stand .,8
felton stood before this strange apparition like one petrified .,1
"according to the laws of dueling at that period , d’artagnan was at liberty to assist whom he pleased . while he was endeavoring to find out which of his companions stood in greatest need , he caught a glance from athos .",31
"at certain turns in the trail we were going along , the lake appeared in its full expanse . the ship 's beacon lit up that whole placid surface , which experienced neither ripples nor undulations . the nautilus lay perfectly still . on its platform and on the embankment , crewmen were bustling around , black shadows that stood out clearly in the midst of the luminous air .",59
"by then we were forced to go back down to the beach because the ridge had become impossible . above us , the yawning crater looked like the wide mouth of a well . from where we stood , the sky was pretty easy to see , and i watched clouds race by , disheveled by the west wind , letting tatters of mist trail over the mountain 's summit . proof positive that those clouds kept at a moderate altitude , because this volcano did n't rise more than 1,800 feet above the level of the ocean .",37
""" no , mr . holmes , i have not . i 've had no time , for it was only yesterday that i learned how matters stood . but in any case i feel that the money should go with the title and estate . that was my poor uncle 's idea . how is the owner going to restore the glories of the baskervilles if he has not money enough to keep up the property ? house , land , and dollars must go together .

"d’artagnan did the same . then , assisted by bicarat , the only one left standing , he bore jussac , cahusac , and one of aramis ’s adversaries who was only wounded , under the porch of the convent .",15
"however that might be , on this evening no fire was lighted on these yet unknown shores , which formed the entrance to the gulf , and the little vessel stood off during the night .",30
"before i had time to express the surprise this new proposition caused me , a camera was carried into the lounge at captain nemo 's request . the liquid setting , electrically lit , unfolded with perfect clarity through the wide - open panels . no shadows , no blurs , thanks to our artificial light . not even sunshine could have been better for our purposes . with the thrust of its propeller curbed by the slant of its fins , the nautilus stood still . the camera was aimed at the scenery on the ocean floor , and in a few seconds we had a perfect negative .",84

"i attach a print of the positive . in it you can view these primordial rocks that have never seen the light of day , this nether granite that forms the powerful foundation of our globe , the deep caves cut into the stony mass , the outlines of incomparable distinctness whose far edges stand out in black as if from the brush of certain flemish painters . in the distance is a mountainous horizon , a wondrously undulating line that makes up the background of this landscape . the general effect of these smooth rocks is indescribable : black , polished , without moss or other blemish , carved into strange shapes , sitting firmly on a carpet of sand that sparkled beneath our streams of electric light .",54
"as my uncle was now taking his stand upon hypotheses , of course , there was nothing to be said .",7
"the hall - door , which was half of glass , stood open ; i stepped over the threshold .",11
"a little hamlet , whose roofs were blent with trees , straggled up the side of one of these hills ; the church of the district stood nearer thornfield : its old tower - top looked over a knoll between the house and gates .",26
"my conjecture had been correct : the strangers had slipped in before us , and they now stood by the vault of the rochesters , their backs towards us , viewing through the rails the old time - stained marble tomb , where a kneeling angel guarded the remains of damer de rochester , slain at marston moor in the time of the civil wars , and of elizabeth , his wife .",17
"fix , who had followed mr . fogg to the station , and saw that he was really going to leave bombay , was there , upon the platform . he had resolved to follow the supposed robber to calcutta , and farther , if necessary . passepartout did not observe the detective , who stood in an obscure corner ; but fix heard him relate his adventures in a few words to mr . fogg .",55
"the clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute ; the clerk did the same ; mr . rochester moved slightly , as if an earthquake had rolled under his feet : taking a firmer footing , and not turning his head or eyes , he said , "" proceed . """,8
"mr . rochester heard , but heeded not : he stood stubborn and rigid , making no movement but to possess himself of my hand .",10
"i looked back at the platform when we had left it far behind , and saw the tall , austere figure of holmes standing motionless and gazing after us .",23
"i do n't know what i expected , but i went out and wandered eastward , soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black grassless squares . about half - past eight i passed by an absurd little theatre , with great flaring gas - jets and gaudy play - bills . a hideous jew , in the most amazing waistcoat i ever beheld in my life , was standing at the entrance , smoking a vile cigar . he had greasy ringlets , and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled shirt . 'have a box , my lord ? ' he said , when he saw me , and he took off his hat with an air of gorgeous servility .",73

"the night was cold . the parsee lit a fire in the bungalow with a few dry branches , and the warmth was very grateful , provisions purchased at kholby sufficed for supper , and the travellers ate ravenously . the conversation , beginning with a few disconnected phrases , soon gave place to loud and steady snores . the guide watched kiouni , who slept standing , bolstering himself against the trunk of a large tree . nothing occurred during the night to disturb the slumberers , although occasional growls from panthers and chatterings of monkeys broke the silence ; the more formidable beasts made no cries or hostile demonstration against the occupants of the bungalow . sir francis slept heavily , like an honest soldier overcome with fatigue . passepartout was wrapped in uneasy dreams of the bouncing of the day before . as for mr . fogg , he slumbered as peacefully as if he had been in his serene mansion in saville row .",66
"near one o'clock in the morning , i was overcome with tremendous exhaustion . my limbs stiffened in the grip of intense cramps . conseil had to keep me going , and attending to our self - preservation became his sole responsibility . i soon heard the poor lad gasping ; his breathing became shallow and quick . i did n't think he could stand such exertions for much longer .",64
"a fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report : the clothed hyena rose up , and stood tall on its hind - feet .",20
"i pressed her in my arms and took my place in the carriage . martha and the young girl , standing at the door , waved their last farewell . then the horses , roused by the driver 's whistling , darted off at a gallop on the road to altona .",20
"sir henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast , so that the time was propitious for my excursion . it was a pleasant walk of four miles along the edge of the moor , leading me at last to a small gray hamlet , in which two larger buildings , which proved to be the inn and the house of dr . mortimer , stood high above the rest . the postmaster , who was also the village grocer , had a clear recollection of the telegram .",65
"yes , i thank god ! "" he put me off his knee , rose , and reverently lifting his hat from his brow , and bending his sightless eyes to the earth , he stood in mute devotion .",35

""" you will , i am sure , excuse my presumption , dr . watson , "" said he , as he came panting up to where i stood .

"now , the islet was not so far distant from lincoln island , but that a vessel , standing for the one , could pass in sight of the other .",18
"cyrus harding stood still , without saying a word .",2
"the inanimate victim was borne along by the vigorous arms which supported her , and which she did not seem in the least to burden . mr . fogg and sir francis stood erect , the parsee bowed his head , and passepartout was , no doubt , scarcely less stupefied .",32
""" you must just stand on one side , "" he answered as he rose , first to his knees , and then to his feet .",4
"on the 11th we reached cape portland . the clear open weather gave us a good view of myrdals jokul , which overhangs it . the cape is merely a low hill with steep sides , standing lonely by the beach .",36
""" thank you : i shall do : i have no broken bones,--only a sprain ; "" and again he stood up and tried his foot , but the result extorted an involuntary "" ugh ! """,20
"i obeyed him ; then he put the glass on the table , stood before me , and looked at me attentively .",13
"i felt no fear of him , and but little shyness . had he been a handsome , heroic- looking young gentleman , i should not have dared to stand thus questioning him against his will , and offering my services unasked .",29
"we might give to that vast bay on the east the name of union bay , for example ; to that large hollow on the south , washington bay ; to the mountain upon which we are standing , that of mount franklin ; to that lake which is extended under our eyes , that of lake grant ; nothing could be better , my friends .",37
for an hour it was impossible to say with any certainty whether the vessel was or was not standing towards lincoln island .,18
"a small fly or moth had fluttered across our path , and in an instant stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it . to my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire , and my acquaintance never paused for an instant , bounding from tuft to tuft behind it , his green net waving in the air . his gray clothes and jerky , zigzag , irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself . i was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the treacherous mire , when i heard the sound of steps , and turning round found a woman near me upon the path . she had come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of merripit house , but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close .",86
she looked at him in horror . he repeated his words . they cut the air like a dagger . the people round began to gape . a lady standing close to her tittered .,29
"pencroft , after a minute examination , was able positively to affirm that the vessel was rigged as a brig , and that she was standing obliquely towards the coast , on the starboard tack , under her topsails and top - gallant - sails .",25
"two wax candles stood lighted on the table , and two on the mantelpiece ; basking in the light and heat of a superb fire , lay pilot -- adele knelt near him .",3
"barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against the glass . his profile was half turned towards me , and his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the moor . for some minutes he stood watching intently . then he gave a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light . instantly i made my way back to my room , and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing once more upon their return journey . long afterwards when i had fallen into a light sleep i heard a key turn somewhere in a lock , but i could not tell whence the sound came . what it all means i can not guess , but there is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of . i do not trouble you with my theories , for you asked me to furnish you only with facts . i have had a long talk with sir henry this morning , and we have made a plan of campaign founded upon my observations of last night . i will not speak about it just now , but it should make my next report interesting reading .",46
"i felt rather indignant at having two characters whom i had admired treated in this cavalier style . i walked over to the window , and stood looking out into the busy street . "" this fellow may be very clever , "" i said to myself , "" but he is certainly very conceited . """,26
""" yes , "" echoed dorian , leaning back in his chair and looking at lord henry over the heavy clusters of purple - lipped irises that stood in the centre of the table , "" what do you mean by good , harry ? """,27
"the boat slowly approached it , cyrus harding stood up in the bows .",8
"we had arranged no plan of campaign , but the baronet is a man to whom the most direct way is always the most natural . he walked into the room , and as he did so barrymore sprang up from the window with a sharp hiss of his breath and stood , livid and trembling , before us . his dark eyes , glaring out of the white mask of his face , were full of horror and astonishment as he gazed from sir henry to me .",51
"i was surly ; but the thing would not go : it stood by me with strange perseverance , and looked and spoke with a sort of authority . i must be aided , and by that hand : and aided i was .",12
"at these words ned land stood up quickly . nearly strangled , the steward staggered out at a signal from his superior ; but such was the commander 's authority aboard his vessel , not one gesture gave away the resentment that this man must have felt toward the canadian . in silence we waited for the outcome of this scene ; conseil , in spite of himself , seemed almost fascinated , i was stunned .",5
""" i 'm not sure about whether i shall go . i am the most incurably lazy devil that ever stood in shoe leather — that is , when the fit is on me , for i can be spry enough at times . """,20
"even the common uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost their interest in the play . they got restless , and began to talk loudly and to whistle . the jew manager , who was standing at the back of the dress - circle , stamped and swore with rage . the only person unmoved was the girl herself .",36
""" you see now how the case stands -- do you not ? "" he continued .",7
"ayrton , pencroft , herbert , and neb stood respectfully apart in an angle of the magnificent saloon , whose atmosphere was saturated with the electric fluid .",8
"would she not content herself with only surveying the coast , and stand out to sea again without landing her crew ?",12
"yet i decided to return to the nautilus . we went along a steep , narrow path that ran over the cliff 's summit . by 11:30 we had arrived at our landing place . the beached skiff had brought the captain ashore . i spotted him standing on a chunk of basalt . his instruments were beside him . his eyes were focused on the northern horizon , along which the sun was sweeping in its extended arc .",47
"yet this part of the province , at a very small distance from the capital , is reckoned among the inhabited and cultivated portions of iceland . what , then , must other tracts be , more desert than this desert ? in the first half mile we had not seen one farmer standing before his cabin door , nor one shepherd tending a flock less wild than himself , nothing but a few cows and sheep left to themselves . what then would be those convulsed regions upon which we were advancing , regions subject to the dire phenomena of eruptions , the offspring of volcanic explosions and subterranean convulsions ?",53
"as soon as it was over , dorian gray rushed behind the scenes into the greenroom . the girl was standing there alone , with a look of triumph on her face . her eyes were lit with an exquisite fire . there was a radiance about her . her parted lips were smiling over some secret of their own .",20
""" well , i can not blame you for standing by your own wife . forget what i have said . go to your room , you two , and we shall talk further about this matter in the morning . """,9
""" perhaps that cursed craft will stand off during the night , and we shall see nothing of her at daybreak . """,6
"it died away , and an absolute silence closed in upon us . we stood straining our ears , but nothing came .",14
"as soon as he was dressed , he went into the library and sat down to a light french breakfast that had been laid out for him on a small round table close to the open window . it was an exquisite day . the warm air seemed laden with spices . a bee flew in and buzzed round the blue - dragon bowl that , filled with sulphur - yellow roses , stood before him . he felt perfectly happy .",73
"leaning against the walls , i dragged myself down the gangways to the lounge , whose ceiling lights were on . the furniture had been knocked over . fortunately the glass cases were solidly secured at the base and had stood fast . since we were no longer vertical , the starboard pictures were glued to the tapestries , while those to port had their lower edges hanging a foot away from the wall . so the nautilus was lying on its starboard side , completely stationary to boot .",40
"then he rose from the table , lit a cigarette , and flung himself down on a luxuriously cushioned couch that stood facing the screen . the screen was an old one , of gilt spanish leather , stamped and wrought with a rather florid louis - quatorze pattern . he scanned it curiously , wondering if ever before it had concealed the secret of a man 's life .",21
"i then entered a dining room , decorated and furnished in austere good taste . inlaid with ebony trim , tall oaken sideboards stood at both ends of this room , and sparkling on their shelves were staggered rows of earthenware , porcelain , and glass of incalculable value . there silver - plated dinnerware gleamed under rays pouring from light fixtures in the ceiling , whose glare was softened and tempered by delicately painted designs .",23
"in the center of this room stood a table , richly spread . captain nemo indicated the place i was to occupy .",6
"felton , quite bewildered , almost mad , stood speechless .",8
"the baron , attracted by the noise , in his chamber gown , his sword under his arm , stood in the doorway .",19

""" marrying sibyl vane ! "" cried lord henry , standing up and looking at him in perplexed amazement . "" but , my dear dorian-- """,10

"it was a library . tall , black - rosewood bookcases , inlaid with copperwork , held on their wide shelves a large number of uniformly bound books . these furnishings followed the contours of the room , their lower parts leading to huge couches upholstered in maroon leather and curved for maximum comfort . light , movable reading stands , which could be pushed away or pulled near as desired , allowed books to be positioned on them for easy study . in the center stood a huge table covered with pamphlets , among which some newspapers , long out of date , were visible . electric light flooded this whole harmonious totality , falling from four frosted half globes set in the scrollwork of the ceiling . i stared in genuine wonderment at this room so ingeniously laid out , and i could n't believe my eyes .",59

"some thirty pictures by the masters , uniformly framed and separated by gleaming panoplies of arms , adorned walls on which were stretched tapestries of austere design . there i saw canvases of the highest value , the likes of which i had marveled at in private european collections and art exhibitions . the various schools of the old masters were represented by a raphael madonna , a virgin by leonardo da vinci , a nymph by correggio , a woman by titian , an adoration of the magi by veronese , an assumption of the virgin by murillo , a holbein portrait , a monk by velazquez , a martyr by ribera , a village fair by rubens , two flemish landscapes by teniers , three little genre paintings by gerard dow , metsu , and paul potter , two canvases by gericault and prud'hon , plus seascapes by backhuysen and vernet . among the works of modern art were pictures signed by delacroix , ingres , decamps , troyon , meissonier , daubigny , etc . , and some wonderful miniature statues in marble or bronze , modeled after antiquity 's finest originals , stood on their pedestals in the corners of this magnificent museum . as the nautilus 's commander had predicted , my mind was already starting to fall into that promised state of stunned amazement .",196
"the ceiling lights were off , yet the lounge was still brightly lit . this was due to the reflecting power of the walls of ice , which threw the beams of our beacon right back at us . words can not describe the effects produced by our galvanic rays on these huge , whimsically sculpted blocks , whose every angle , ridge , and facet gave off a different glow depending on the nature of the veins running inside the ice . it was a dazzling mine of gems , in particular sapphires and emeralds , whose jets of blue and green crisscrossed . here and there , opaline hues of infinite subtlety raced among sparks of light that were like so many fiery diamonds , their brilliance more than any eye could stand . the power of our beacon was increased a hundredfold , like a lamp shining through the biconvex lenses of a world - class lighthouse .",134
"with this announcement he rose from his chair , and stood , leaning his arm on the marble mantelpiece : in that attitude his shape was seen plainly as well as his face ; his unusual breadth of chest , disproportionate almost to his length of limb .",10
i stood up and lifted my hand ; it stopped .,1
"for there would be a real pleasure in watching it . he would be able to follow his mind into its secret places . this portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors . as it had revealed to him his own body , so it would reveal to him his own soul . and when winter came upon it , he would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of summer . when the blood crept from its face , and left behind a pallid mask of chalk with leaden eyes , he would keep the glamour of boyhood . not one blossom of his loveliness would ever fade . not one pulse of his life would ever weaken . like the gods of the greeks , he would be strong , and fleet , and joyous . what did it matter what happened to the coloured image on the canvas ? he would be safe . that was everything .",67
"yet hans did not think it prudent to spend the night upon the sides of the cone . we continued our zigzag climb . the fifteen hundred remaining feet took us five hours to clear ; the circuitous route , the diagonal and the counter marches , must have measured at least three leagues . i could stand it no longer . i was yielding to the effects of hunger and cold . the rarefied air scarcely gave play to the action of my lungs .",57
"indeed , my hands were holding my own work on the great ocean depths . i had n't even suspected . i closed the book and resumed my strolling . ned and conseil stood up to leave .",33
""" yes ; we are only thirty - five leagues from it ; and during thaws the white bears , borne by the ice fields from the north , are carried even into iceland . but never mind that . here we are at the top of snæfell and here are two peaks , one north and one south . hans will tell us the name of that on which we are now standing . """,73
"with the beginning of the year 1866 the heat was very great , but the hunting in the forests did not stand still .",21
"at mid - day we arrived . i raised my head and saw straight above me the upper aperture of the cone , framing a bit of sky of very small circumference , but almost perfectly round . just upon the edge appeared the snowy peak of saris , standing out sharp and clear against endless space .",49
"suddenly my uncle uttered a cry . i thought his foot must have slipped and that he had fallen down one of the holes . but , no ; i saw him , with arms outstretched and legs straddling wide apart , erect before a granite rock that stood in the centre of the crater , just like a pedestal made ready to receive a statue of pluto . he stood like a man stupefied , but the stupefaction soon gave way to delirious rapture .",48

"dorian shook his head . "" you must not ask me that , basil . i could not possibly let you stand in front of that picture . """,21

"a pretty little house stood at the top of the lane , with a garden before it , exquisitely neat and brilliantly blooming . i stopped at it .",4
"phileas fogg , with body erect and legs wide apart , standing like a sailor , gazed without staggering at the swelling waters . the young woman , who was seated aft , was profoundly affected as she looked out upon the ocean , darkening now with the twilight , on which she had ventured in so frail a vessel . above her head rustled the white sails , which seemed like great white wings . the boat , carried forward by the wind , seemed to be flying in the air .",11
""" oh , "" he exclaimed , "" if only my nautilus were strong enough to stand that much pressure without being crushed ! """,16
""" yes , captain , maybe so . but whatever resistance to crushing the nautilus may have , it still could n't stand such dreadful pressures , and it would be squashed as flat as a piece of sheet iron . """,22
"near the churchyard , and in the middle of a garden , stood a well - built though small house , which i had no doubt was the parsonage .",12
in half an hour we were standing upon the surface of a rock jammed in across the chimney from one side to the other .,6
"meanwhile , motionless and silent , captain nemo stood lost in thought . an idea visibly crossed his mind . but he seemed to brush it aside . he told himself no . at last these words escaped his lips :",8
""" ' but why did you stand all this , ' i asked . ' i suppose that you can get rid of your boarders when you wish . '",6
""" during the moment i was silent , miss eyre , i was arranging a point with my destiny . she stood there , by that beech - trunk -- a hag like one of those who appeared to macbeth on the heath of forres .",21
"his eye fell on the yellow book that lord henry had sent him . what was it , he wondered . he went towards the little , pearl - coloured octagonal stand that had always looked to him like the work of some strange egyptian bees that wrought in silver , and taking up the volume , flung himself into an arm - chair and began to turn over the leaves . after a few minutes he became absorbed . it was the strangest book that he had ever read . it seemed to him that in exquisite raiment , and to the delicate sound of flutes , the sins of the world were passing in dumb show before him . things that he had dimly dreamed of were suddenly made real to him . things of which he had never dreamed were gradually revealed .",31
""" signal her ! "" said phileas fogg quietly . a small brass cannon stood on the forward deck of the tankadere , for making signals in the fogs .",14
"often , on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were his friends , or thought that they were so , he himself would creep upstairs to the locked room , open the door with the key that never left him now , and stand , with a mirror , in front of the portrait that basil hallward had painted of him , looking now at the evil and aging face on the canvas , and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him from the polished glass . the very sharpness of the contrast used to quicken his sense of pleasure . he grew more and more enamoured of his own beauty , more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul . he would examine with minute care , and sometimes with a monstrous and terrible delight , the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth , wondering sometimes which were the more horrible , the signs of sin or the signs of age . he would place his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture , and smile . he mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs .",57
"and i sank down where i stood , and hid my face against the ground .",6
"once or twice more he spoke to the colonists who stood around him , and smiled on them with that last smile which continues after death .",10
"near the middle of the platform , the skiff was half set in the ship 's hull , making a slight bulge . fore and aft stood two cupolas of moderate height , their sides slanting and partly inset with heavy biconvex glass , one reserved for the helmsman steering the nautilus , the other for the brilliance of the powerful electric beacon lighting his way .",26
"a stand between them supported a second candle and two great volumes , to which they frequently referred , comparing them , seemingly , with the smaller books they held in their hands , like people consulting a dictionary to aid them in the task of translation .",1
"hallward shook his head , as he entered , and followed dorian into the library . there was a bright wood fire blazing in the large open hearth . the lamps were lit , and an open dutch silver spirit - case stood , with some siphons of soda - water and large cut - glass tumblers , on a little marqueterie table .",42
"the worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat as hearty a breakfast as possible before leaving the carnatic ; but , as he had been walking about all day , the demands of hunger were becoming importunate . he observed that the butchers stalls contained neither mutton , goat , nor pork ; and , knowing also that it is a sacrilege to kill cattle , which are preserved solely for farming , he made up his mind that meat was far from plentiful in yokohama -- nor was he mistaken ; and , in default of butcher 's meat , he could have wished for a quarter of wild boar or deer , a partridge , or some quails , some game or fish , which , with rice , the japanese eat almost exclusively . but he found it necessary to keep up a stout heart , and to postpone the meal he craved till the following morning . night came , and passepartout re - entered the native quarter , where he wandered through the streets , lit by vari - coloured lanterns , looking on at the dancers , who were executing skilful steps and boundings , and the astrologers who stood in the open air with their telescopes . then he came to the harbour , which was lit up by the resin torches of the fishermen , who were fishing from their boats .",207
"the telescope , a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod , stood upon the flat leads of the house . frankland clapped his eye to it and gave a cry of satisfaction .",11
"the head of my bed was near the door , and i thought at first the goblin - laugher stood at my bedside -- or rather , crouched by my pillow : but i rose , looked round , and could see nothing ; while , as i still gazed , the unnatural sound was reiterated : and i knew it came from behind the panels .",19
the man at the tiller stood up and looked for the best place at which to land .,5
"but there were ample signs that i had not come upon a false scent . this was certainly where the man lived . some blankets rolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which neolithic man had once slumbered . the ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate . beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket half - full of water . a litter of empty tins showed that the place had been occupied for some time , and i saw , as my eyes became accustomed to the checkered light , a pannikin and a half - full bottle of spirits standing in the corner . in the middle of the hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table , and upon this stood a small cloth bundle -- the same , no doubt , which i had seen through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy . it contained a loaf of bread , a tinned tongue , and two tins of preserved peaches . as i set it down again , after having examined it , my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it . i raised it , and this was what i read , roughly scrawled in pencil:--",110

"on her side , milady tried to encourage felton in his project ; but at the first words which issued from her mouth , she plainly saw that the young fanatic stood more in need of being moderated than urged .",31
"we stood stock - still , not knowing what surprise was waiting for us , whether pleasant or unpleasant . but a sliding sound became audible . you could tell that some panels were shifting over the nautilus 's sides .",1
"i looked around me . we were standing at the intersection of two roads , both dark and narrow . which were we to take ? this was a difficulty .",7
"as long as he remained in the boat which conveyed him to land , he kept his face toward milady , who , standing on the deck , followed him with her eyes .",23
"a twisted flash of pain shot across the painter 's face . he paused for a moment , and a wild feeling of pity came over him . after all , what right had he to pry into the life of dorian gray ? if he had done a tithe of what was rumoured about him , how much he must have suffered ! then he straightened himself up , and walked over to the fire - place , and stood there , looking at the burning logs with their frostlike ashes and their throbbing cores of flame .",80
"the nautilus seemed to be standing still . this was due to the lack of landmarks . but streaks of water , parted by the ship 's spur , sometimes threaded before our eyes with extraordinary speed .",5
"some zoophytes were dredged up by the chain of our trawl . most were lovely sea anemone belonging to the family actinidia , including among other species , the phyctalis protexta , native to this part of the ocean : a small cylindrical trunk adorned with vertical lines , mottled with red spots , and crowned by a wondrous blossoming of tentacles . as for mollusks , they consisted of exhibits i had already observed : turret snails , olive shells of the "" tent olive "" species with neatly intersecting lines and russet spots standing out sharply against a flesh - colored background , fanciful spider conchs that looked like petrified scorpions , transparent glass snails , argonauts , some highly edible cuttlefish , and certain species of squid that the naturalists of antiquity classified with the flying fish , which are used chiefly as bait for catching cod .",95
"he immediately ran in the direction of portsmouth , which he saw at nearly half a league before him , standing out in the haze of the morning , with its houses and towers .",20
""" well , i can not stand it any longer , "" i replied .",6
"in the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the sierra blanco . as far as the eye can reach stretches the great flat plain - land , all dusted over with patches of alkali , and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes . on the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks , with their rugged summits flecked with snow . in this great stretch of country there is no sign of life , nor of anything appertaining to life . there is no bird in the steel - blue heaven , no movement upon the dull , grey earth — above all , there is absolute silence . listen as one may , there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness ; nothing but silence — complete and heart - subduing silence . it has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain . that is hardly true . looking down from the sierra blanco , one sees a pathway traced out across the desert , which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance . it is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers . here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun , and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali . approach , and examine them ! they are bones : some large and coarse , others smaller and more delicate . the former have belonged to oxen , and the latter to men . for fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside .",233

"athos was standing before the door , enveloped in his cloak , with his hat pulled down over his eyes .",2
"he could hear nothing , but the drip , drip on the threadbare carpet . he opened the door and went out on the landing . the house was absolutely quiet . no one was about . for a few seconds he stood bending over the balustrade and peering down into the black seething well of darkness . then he took out the key and returned to the room , locking himself in as he did so .",42
"with difficulty i obeyed him . presently i stood within that clean , bright kitchen -- on the very hearth -- trembling , sickening ; conscious of an aspect in the last degree ghastly , wild , and weather - beaten .",8
"but a kind of lurid brilliancy spread over the island , against which stood out confusedly the wooded masses of the heights .",13

"the raging sea was swept with huge tattered clouds drenched by the waves . i saw no more of the small intervening billows that form in the troughs of the big crests . just long , soot - colored undulations with crests so compact they did n't foam . they kept growing taller . they were spurring each other on . the nautilus , sometimes lying on its side , sometimes standing on end like a mast , rolled and pitched frightfully .",71
