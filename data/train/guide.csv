"at five in the morning i was awoke by the neighing and pawing of four horses under my window . i dressed hastily and came down into the street . hans was finishing our packing , almost as it were without moving a limb ; and yet he did his work cleverly . my uncle made more noise than execution , and the guide seemed to pay very little attention to his energetic directions .",63,"('guide', 'guide', 'guiar')",0

"on february 10 , 1828 , the new astrolabe hove before tikopia island , took on a guide and interpreter in the person of a deserter who had settled there , plied a course toward vanikoro , raised it on february 12 , sailed along its reefs until the 14th , and only on the 20th dropped anchor inside its barrier in the harbor of vana .",17,"('guide', 'guide', 'guiar')",0

"that favourable moment arrived only with six o'clock ; when my uncle , myself , the guide , two other passengers and the four horses , trusted ourselves to a somewhat fragile raft . accustomed as i was to the swift and sure steamers on the elbe , i found the oars of the rowers rather a slow means of propulsion . it took us more than an hour to cross the fiord ; but the passage was effected without any mishap .",16,"('guide', 'guide', 'guiar')",0
"one thing , however , he felt that it had done for him . it had made him conscious how unjust , how cruel , he had been to sibyl vane . it was not too late to make reparation for that . she could still be his wife . his unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence , would be transformed into some nobler passion , and the portrait that basil hallward had painted of him would be a guide to him through life , would be to him what holiness is to some , and conscience to others , and the fear of god to us all . there were opiates for remorse , drugs that could lull the moral sense to sleep . but here was a visible symbol of the degradation of sin . here was an ever - present sign of the ruin men brought upon their souls .",83,"('guide', 'guide', 'guiar')",0

"hans slept peaceably at the foot of a rock , in a lava bed , where he had found a suitable couch for himself ; but my uncle was pacing around the bottom of the crater like a wild beast in a cage . i had neither the wish nor the strength to rise , and following the guide 's example i went off into an unhappy slumber , fancying i could hear ominous noises or feel tremblings within the recesses of the mountain .",58,"('guide', 'guide', 'guiar')",0

"in order to shorten the journey , the guide passed to the left of the line where the railway was still in process of being built . this line , owing to the capricious turnings of the vindhia mountains , did not pursue a straight course . the parsee , who was quite familiar with the roads and paths in the district , declared that they would gain twenty miles by striking directly through the forest .",8,"('guide', 'guide', 'guiar')",0
"after two hours the guide stopped the elephant , and gave him an hour for rest , during which kiouni , after quenching his thirst at a neighbouring spring , set to devouring the branches and shrubs round about him . neither sir francis nor mr . fogg regretted the delay , and both descended with a feeling of relief . "" why , he 's made of iron ! "" exclaimed the general , gazing admiringly on kiouni .",4,"('guide', 'guide', 'guiar')",0
"the night was cold . the parsee lit a fire in the bungalow with a few dry branches , and the warmth was very grateful , provisions purchased at kholby sufficed for supper , and the travellers ate ravenously . the conversation , beginning with a few disconnected phrases , soon gave place to loud and steady snores . the guide watched kiouni , who slept standing , bolstering himself against the trunk of a large tree . nothing occurred during the night to disturb the slumberers , although occasional growls from panthers and chatterings of monkeys broke the silence ; the more formidable beasts made no cries or hostile demonstration against the occupants of the bungalow . sir francis slept heavily , like an honest soldier overcome with fatigue . passepartout was wrapped in uneasy dreams of the bouncing of the day before . as for mr . fogg , he slumbered as peacefully as if he had been in his serene mansion in saville row .",60,"('guide', 'guide', 'guiar')",0

"the guide unloosed the elephant and led him into a thicket , at the same time asking the travellers not to stir . he held himself ready to bestride the animal at a moment 's notice , should flight become necessary ; but he evidently thought that the procession of the faithful would pass without perceiving them amid the thick foliage , in which they were wholly concealed .",1,"('guide', 'guide', 'guiar')",0

"the guide watched this scene with his usual phlegmatic unconcern . yet he understood perfectly well what was going on between his two companions . the gestures themselves were sufficient to show that we were each bent on taking a different road ; but hans seemed to take no part in a question upon which depended his life . he was ready to start at a given signal , or to stay , if his master so willed it .",1,"('guide', 'guide', 'guiar')",0
"the guide now led the elephant out of the thicket , and leaped upon his neck . just at the moment that he was about to urge kiouni forward with a peculiar whistle , mr . fogg stopped him , and , turning to sir francis cromarty , said , "" suppose we save this woman .

"the parsee 's narrative only confirmed mr . fogg and his companions in their generous design . it was decided that the guide should direct the elephant towards the pagoda of pillaji , which he accordingly approached as quickly as possible . they halted , half an hour afterwards , in a copse , some five hundred feet from the pagoda , where they were well concealed ; but they could hear the groans and cries of the fakirs distinctly .",22,"('guide', 'guide', 'guiar')",0

"in the background , among the trees , the pagoda of pillaji loomed distinctly . much to the guide 's disappointment , the guards of the rajah , lighted by torches , were watching at the doors and marching to and fro with naked sabres ; probably the priests , too , were watching within .",18,"('guide', 'guide', 'guiar')",0
"the time seemed long ; the guide ever and anon left them to take an observation on the edge of the wood , but the guards watched steadily by the glare of the torches , and a dim light crept through the windows of the pagoda .",6,"('guide', 'guide', 'guiar')",0
"after a last consultation , the guide announced that he was ready for the attempt , and advanced , followed by the others . they took a roundabout way , so as to get at the pagoda on the rear . they reached the walls about half - past twelve , without having met anyone ; here there was no guard , nor were there either windows or doors .",6,"('guide', 'guide', 'guiar')",0
"they set noiselessly to work , and the parsee on one side and passepartout on the other began to loosen the bricks so as to make an aperture two feet wide . they were getting on rapidly , when suddenly a cry was heard in the interior of the temple , followed almost instantly by other cries replying from the outside . passepartout and the guide stopped . had they been heard ? was the alarm being given ? common prudence urged them to retire , and they did so , followed by phileas fogg and sir francis . they again hid themselves in the wood , and waited till the disturbance , whatever it might be , ceased , holding themselves ready to resume their attempt without delay . but , awkwardly enough , the guards now appeared at the rear of the temple , and there installed themselves , in readiness to prevent a surprise .",65,"('guide', 'guide', 'guiar')",0
"it would be difficult to describe the disappointment of the party , thus interrupted in their work . they could not now reach the victim ; how , then , could they save her ? sir francis shook his fists , passepartout was beside himself , and the guide gnashed his teeth with rage . the tranquil fogg waited , without betraying any emotion .",48,"('guide', 'guide', 'guiar')",0

"the elephant , thanks to the skilful guidance of the parsee , was advancing rapidly through the still darksome forest , and , an hour after leaving the pagoda , had crossed a vast plain . they made a halt at seven o'clock , the young woman being still in a state of complete prostration . the guide made her drink a little brandy and water , but the drowsiness which stupefied her could not yet be shaken off .",57,"('guide', 'guide', 'guiar')",0
"it is enough to say , without applying this poetical rhapsody to aouda , that she was a charming woman , in all the european acceptation of the phrase . she spoke english with great purity , and the guide had not exaggerated in saying that the young parsee had been transformed by her bringing up .",39,"('guide', 'guide', 'guiar')",0
"the train was about to start from allahabad , and mr . fogg proceeded to pay the guide the price agreed upon for his service , and not a farthing more ; which astonished passepartout , who remembered all that his master owed to the guide 's devotion . he had , indeed , risked his life in the adventure at pillaji , and , if he should be caught afterwards by the indians , he would with difficulty escape their vengeance . kiouni , also , must be disposed of . what should be done with the elephant , which had been so dearly purchased ? phileas fogg had already determined this question .",45,"('guide', 'guide', 'guiar')",0
