"it was upon the 4th of march , as i have good reason to remember , that i rose somewhat earlier than usual , and found that sherlock holmes had not yet finished his breakfast . the landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared . with the unreasonable petulance of mankind i rang the bell and gave a curt intimation that i was ready . then i picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it , while my companion munched silently at his toast . one of the articles had a pencil mark at the heading , and i naturally began to run my eye through it .",113
"the nautilus kept to its southeasterly heading . on december 1 it cut the equator at longitude 142 degrees , and on the 4th of the same month , after a quick crossing marked by no incident , we raised the marquesas islands . three miles off , in latitude 8 degrees 57 ' south and longitude 139 degrees 32 ' west , i spotted martin point on nuku hiva , chief member of this island group that belongs to france . i could make out only its wooded mountains on the horizon , because captain nemo hated to hug shore . there our nets brought up some fine fish samples : dolphinfish with azure fins , gold tails , and flesh that 's unrivaled in the entire world , wrasse from the genus hologymnosus that were nearly denuded of scales but exquisite in flavor , knifejaws with bony beaks , yellowish albacore that were as tasty as bonito , all fish worth classifying in the ship 's pantry .",33
"after leaving these delightful islands to the protection of the french flag , the nautilus covered about 2,000 miles from december 4 to the 11th . its navigating was marked by an encounter with an immense school of squid , unusual mollusks that are near neighbors of the cuttlefish . french fishermen give them the name "" cuckoldfish , "" and they belong to the class cephalopoda , family dibranchiata , consisting of themselves together with cuttlefish and argonauts . the naturalists of antiquity made a special study of them , and these animals furnished many ribald figures of speech for soapbox orators in the greek marketplace , as well as excellent dishes for the tables of rich citizens , if we 're to believe athenaeus , a greek physician predating galen .",29
"the same peculiarity marked the tools and utensils ; all were new , which proved that the articles had not been taken by chance and thrown into the chest , but , on the contrary , that the choice of things had been well considered and arranged with care .",3
"it can not be doubted that the balloon came from a great distance , for it could not have traveled less than two thousand miles in twenty - four hours . at any rate the passengers , destitute of all marks for their guidance , could not have possessed the means of reckoning the route traversed since their departure .",40
"during that day a fearsome school of sharks provided us with an escort . dreadful animals that teem in these seas and make them extremely dangerous . there were port jackson sharks with a brown back , a whitish belly , and eleven rows of teeth , bigeye sharks with necks marked by a large black spot encircled in white and resembling an eye , and isabella sharks whose rounded snouts were strewn with dark speckles . often these powerful animals rushed at the lounge window with a violence less than comforting . by this point ned land had lost all self - control . he wanted to rise to the surface of the waves and harpoon the monsters , especially certain smooth - hound sharks whose mouths were paved with teeth arranged like a mosaic , and some big five - meter tiger sharks that insisted on personally provoking him . but the nautilus soon picked up speed and easily left astern the fastest of these man - eaters .",51
