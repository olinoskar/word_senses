"the juncture was favorable . the english , who require , above everything , good living in order to be good soldiers , only eating salt meat and bad biscuit , had many invalids in their camp . still further , the sea , very rough at this period of the year all along the sea coast , destroyed every day some little vessel ; and the shore , from the point of l’aiguillon to the trenches , was at every tide literally covered with the wrecks of pinnacles , roberges , and feluccas . the result was that even if the king ’s troops remained quietly in their camp , it was evident that some day or other , buckingham , who only continued in the isle from obstinacy , would be obliged to raise the siege .",9

"jussac was , as was then said , a fine blade , and had had much practice ; nevertheless it required all his skill to defend himself against an adversary who , active and energetic , departed every instant from received rules , attacking him on all sides at once , and yet parrying like a man who had the greatest respect for his own epidermis .",20
"an unbearable heaviness weighed me down . near three o'clock in the afternoon , this agonizing sensation affected me to an intense degree . yawns dislocated my jaws . my lungs were gasping in their quest for that enkindling elastic fluid required for breathing , now growing scarcer and scarcer . my mind was in a daze . i lay outstretched , strength gone , nearly unconscious . my gallant conseil felt the same symptoms , suffered the same sufferings , yet never left my side . he held my hand , he kept encouraging me , and i even heard him mutter :",41
