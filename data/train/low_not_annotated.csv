"work began immediately and was carried on with tireless tenacity . instead of digging all around the nautilus , which would have entailed even greater difficulties , captain nemo had an immense trench outlined on the ice , eight meters from our port quarter . then his men simultaneously staked it off at several points around its circumference . soon their picks were vigorously attacking this compact matter , and huge chunks were loosened from its mass . these chunks weighed less than the water , and by an unusual effect of specific gravity , each chunk took wing , as it were , to the roof of the tunnel , which thickened above by as much as it diminished below . but this hardly mattered so long as the lower surface kept growing thinner .",130

"the journey was resumed at six in the morning ; the guide hoped to reach allahabad by evening . in that case , mr . fogg would only lose a part of the forty - eight hours saved since the beginning of the tour . kiouni , resuming his rapid gait , soon descended the lower spurs of the vindhias , and towards noon they passed by the village of kallenger , on the cani , one of the branches of the ganges . the guide avoided inhabited places , thinking it safer to keep the open country , which lies along the first depressions of the basin of the great river . allahabad was now only twelve miles to the north - east . they stopped under a clump of bananas , the fruit of which , as healthy as bread and as succulent as cream , was amply partaken of and appreciated .",55
"_ oct . _ 25.—it rained all night and all day , with some gusts of wind ; during which time the ship broke in pieces , the wind blowing a little harder than before , and was no more to be seen , except the wreck of her , and that only at low water . i spent this day in covering and securing the goods which i had saved , that the rain might not spoil them .",54

"we mounted the first staircase , passed up the gallery , proceeded to the third storey : the low , black door , opened by mr . rochester 's master - key , admitted us to the tapestried room , with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet .",18
"i drew aside my curtains before i went to bed and looked out from my window . it opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of the hall door . beyond , two copses of trees moaned and swung in a rising wind . a half moon broke through the rifts of racing clouds . in its cold light i saw beyond the trees a broken fringe of rocks , and the long , low curve of the melancholy moor . i closed the curtain , feeling that my last impression was in keeping with the rest .",76

"a whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity ; for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind ; and the exceeding density of the clouds ( which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house ) did not prevent our perceiving the life - like velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other , without passing away into the distance .",36

"here again i paused abruptly , and now with a feeling of wild amazement — for there could be no doubt whatever that , in this instance , i did actually hear ( although from what direction it proceeded i found it impossible to say ) a low and apparently distant , but harsh , protracted , and most unusual screaming or grating sound — the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon ’s unnatural shriek as described by the romancer .",47

"they had to profit by the low tide to cross the channel , and it was agreed that they would construct , for this purpose , as well as they could , a boat which would render communication so much easier , and would also permit them to ascend the mercy , at the time of their grand exploration of the southwest of the island , which was put off till the first fine days .",6
"for a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold — then , with a low moaning cry , fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother , and in her violent and now final death - agonies , bore him to the floor a corpse , and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated .",19
"as we approach nearer the dimensions of the liquid column become magnificent . the islet resembles , with a most deceiving likeness , an enormous cetacean , whose head dominates the waves at a height of twenty yards . the geyser , a word meaning ' fury , ' rises majestically from its extremity . deep and heavy explosions are heard from time to time , when the enormous jet , possessed with more furious violence , shakes its plumy crest , and springs with a bound till it reaches the lowest stratum of the clouds . it stands alone . no steam vents , no hot springs surround it , and all the volcanic power of the region is concentrated here . sparks of electric fire mingle with the dazzling sheaf of lighted fluid , every drop of which refracts the prismatic colours .",91
"i had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard -- turned its angle : there was a gate just there , opening into the meadow , between two stone pillars crowned by stone balls .",5
"under these conditions the barometer generally stayed quite low . it fell as far as 73.5 centimeters . our compass indications no longer offered any guarantees . the deranged needles would mark contradictory directions as we approached the southern magnetic pole , which does n't coincide with the south pole proper . in fact , according to the astronomer hansteen , this magnetic pole is located fairly close to latitude 70 degrees and longitude 130 degrees , or abiding by the observations of louis - isidore duperrey , in longitude 135 degrees and latitude 70 degrees 30 ' . hence we had to transport compasses to different parts of the ship , take many readings , and strike an average . often we could chart our course only by guesswork , a less than satisfactory method in the midst of these winding passageways whose landmarks change continuously .",8
"on the declivity of the atlantic basin the first streams , branches of the north platte river , already appeared . the whole northern and eastern horizon was bounded by the immense semi - circular curtain which is formed by the southern portion of the rocky mountains , the highest being laramie peak . between this and the railway extended vast plains , plentifully irrigated . on the right rose the lower spurs of the mountainous mass which extends southward to the sources of the arkansas river , one of the great tributaries of the missouri .",71
"but , to decide this important question , it was necessary to wait until the tide was quite low , so that every part of the brig 's hull might be examined .",18
"alice was not a bit hurt , and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment : she looked up , but it was all dark overhead ; before her was another long passage , and the white rabbit was still in sight , hurrying down it . there was not a moment to be lost : away went alice like the wind , and was just in time to hear it say , as it turned a corner , ' oh my ears and whiskers , how late it 's getting ! ' she was close behind it when she turned the corner , but the rabbit was no longer to be seen : she found herself in a long , low hall , which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof . there were doors all round the hall , but they were all locked ; and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other , trying every door , she walked sadly down the middle , wondering how she was ever to get out again .",124
"suddenly she came upon a little three - legged table , all made of solid glass ; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key , and alice 's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall ; but , alas ! either the locks were too large , or the key was too small , but at any rate it would not open any of them . however , on the second time round , she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before , and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high : she tried the little golden key in the lock , and to her great delight it fitted !",89
"on the 11th we reached cape portland . the clear open weather gave us a good view of myrdals jokul , which overhangs it . the cape is merely a low hill with steep sides , standing lonely by the beach .",30
"for some minutes i am still contemplating the geyser . i notice that it throws up its column of water with variable force : sometimes sending it to a great height , then again to a lower , which i attribute to the variable pressure of the steam accumulated in its reservoir .",36
"near this dwelling of mine , but a little farther within the land , and upon lower ground , lay my two pieces of corn land , which i kept duly cultivated and sowed , and which duly yielded me their harvest in its season ; and whenever i had occasion for more corn , i had more land adjoining as fit as that .",16
"at last we leave the island , rounding away past the low rocks on its southern shore . hans has taken advantage of the halt to refit his rudder .",11
"i feel peculiar sensations , like many creatures on earth at the approach of violent atmospheric changes . the heavily voluted cumulus clouds lower gloomily and threateningly ; they wear that implacable look which i have sometimes noticed at the outbreak of a great storm . the air is heavy ; the sea is calm .",23

"a long , low moan , indescribably sad , swept over the moor . it filled the whole air , and yet it was impossible to say whence it came . from a dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar , and then sank back into a melancholy , throbbing murmur once again . stapleton looked at me with a curious expression in his face .",3
"a slight undulation of the waves carried it farther under the low arch of the crypt , and there ayrton , with the aid of flint and steel , lighted the lamp .",11
"but there was an immense quantity of it ; the tongue alone yielded six thousand pounds of oil , and the lower lip four thousand .",21
"soon , scarcely blurred by their distance from us , the forms of some objects took shape before my eyes . i recognized the lower slopes of some magnificent rocks carpeted by the finest zoophyte specimens , and right off , i was struck by an effect unique to this medium .",24
"after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance , and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming . it was the white rabbit returning , splendidly dressed , with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other : he came trotting along in a great hurry , muttering to himself as he came , ' oh ! the duchess , the duchess ! oh ! wo n't she be savage if i 've kept her waiting ! ' alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one ; so , when the rabbit came near her , she began , in a low , timid voice , ' if you please , sir-- ' the rabbit started violently , dropped the white kid gloves and the fan , and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go .",123

"that 's how we ended this conversation , which later was to have such serious consequences . at first , i must say , events seemed to confirm my forecasts , much to the canadian 's despair . did captain nemo view us with distrust in these heavily traveled seas , or did he simply want to hide from the sight of those ships of every nation that plowed the mediterranean ? i have no idea , but usually he stayed in midwater and well out from any coast . either the nautilus surfaced only enough to let its pilothouse emerge , or it slipped away to the lower depths , although , between the greek islands and asia minor , we did n't find bottom even at 2,000 meters down .",108
""" right , "" i said , carried away by the captain 's logic . "" even though the surface of the sea has solidified into ice , its lower strata are still open , thanks to that divine justice that puts the maximum density of salt water one degree above its freezing point . and if i 'm not mistaken , the submerged part of this ice bank is in a four - to - one ratio to its emerging part .

"so she called softly after it , ' mouse dear ! do come back again , and we wo n't talk about cats or dogs either , if you do n't like them ! ' when the mouse heard this , it turned round and swam slowly back to her : its face was quite pale ( with passion , alice thought ) , and it said in a low trembling voice , ' let us get to the shore , and then i 'll tell you my history , and you 'll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs .

"but the skies became more and more threatening . there were conspicuous signs of a hurricane on the way . the atmosphere was turning white and milky . slender sheaves of cirrus clouds were followed on the horizon by layers of nimbocumulus . other low clouds fled swiftly . the sea grew towering , inflated by long swells . every bird had disappeared except a few petrels , friends of the storms . the barometer fell significantly , indicating a tremendous tension in the surrounding haze . the mixture in our stormglass decomposed under the influence of the electricity charging the air . a struggle of the elements was approaching .",44
"it has split the lower part of the hull , instead of blowing up the deck and topsides !",4
"our return journey began . captain nemo resumed the lead in our little band , always heading forward without hesitation . i noted that we did n't follow the same path in returning to the nautilus . this new route , very steep and hence very arduous , quickly took us close to the surface of the sea . but this return to the upper strata was n't so sudden that decompression took place too quickly , which could have led to serious organic disorders and given us those internal injuries so fatal to divers . with great promptness , the light reappeared and grew stronger ; and the refraction of the sun , already low on the horizon , again ringed the edges of various objects with the entire color spectrum .",115
"the crimson curtain hung before the arch : slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in the adjoining saloon , they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur .",28
""" me , i 'm out like a light !

"this incident did not interrupt our walk . for two hours we were sometimes led over plains of sand , sometimes over prairies of seaweed that were quite arduous to cross . in all honesty , i was dead tired by the time i spotted a hazy glow half a mile away , cutting through the darkness of the waters . it was the nautilus 's beacon . within twenty minutes we would be on board , and there i could breathe easy again -- because my tank 's current air supply seemed to be quite low in oxygen . but i was reckoning without an encounter that slightly delayed our arrival .",96

"they dispersed about the room , reminding me , by the lightness and buoyancy of their movements , of a flock of white plumy birds . some of them threw themselves in half - reclining positions on the sofas and ottomans : some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books : the rest gathered in a group round the fire : all talked in a low but clear tone which seemed habitual to them .",68
"equipped with picks , some ten men climbed onto the nautilus 's sides and cracked loose the ice around the ship 's lower plating , which was soon set free . this operation was swiftly executed because the fresh ice was still thin . we all reentered the interior . the main ballast tanks were filled with the water that had n't yet congealed at our line of flotation . the nautilus submerged without delay .",22

"i reentered my stateroom , very puzzled , as you can imagine . i tried in vain to fall asleep . i kept searching for a relationship between the appearance of the diver and that chest filled with gold . soon , from certain rolling and pitching movements , i sensed that the nautilus had left the lower strata and was back on the surface of the water .",57

"on january 25 , the ocean being completely deserted , the nautilus spent the day on the surface , churning the waves with its powerful propeller and making them spurt to great heights . under these conditions , who would n't have mistaken it for a gigantic cetacean ? i spent three - quarters of the day on the platform . i stared at the sea . nothing on the horizon , except near four o'clock in the afternoon a long steamer to the west , running on our opposite tack . its masting was visible for an instant , but it could n't have seen the nautilus because we were lying too low in the water . i imagine that steamboat belonged to the peninsular & oriental line , which provides service from the island of ceylon to sidney , also calling at king george sound and melbourne .",113
