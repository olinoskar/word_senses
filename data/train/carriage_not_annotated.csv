"the london express came roaring into the station , and a small , wiry bulldog of a man had sprung from a first - class carriage . we all three shook hands , and i saw at once from the reverential way in which lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a good deal since the days when they had first worked together . i could well remember the scorn which the theories of the reasoner used then to excite in the practical man .",25
"an elegant carriage waited below , and as it was drawn by two excellent horses , they were soon at the place royale .",2
"the noble carriage of this gentleman , for whom he believed himself to be engaged , had won planchet -- that was the name of the picard . he felt a slight disappointment , however , when he saw that this place was already taken by a compeer named mousqueton , and when porthos signified to him that the state of his household , though great , would not support two servants , and that he must enter into the service of d’artagnan .",2
bessie now returned ; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up the gravel - walk .,9
""" i suspect , "" said he , "" a tall , dark man , of lofty carriage , who has the air of a great lord . he has followed us several times , as i think , when i have waited for my wife at the wicket of the louvre to escort her home . """,17
""" however , since you are determined to leave us , i will immediately give orders to the superintendent of my carriages to cause one to be made that will convey you very safely . when they have conducted you to the back of the mountains , nobody can attend you farther ; for my subjects have made a vow never to quit the kingdom , and they are too prudent to break it . ask me whatever else you please . """,21
"from this window were visible the porter 's lodge and the carriage - road , and just as i had dissolved so much of the silver - white foliage veiling the panes as left room to look out , i saw the gates thrown open and a carriage roll through .",11

"d’artagnan , half stupefied , without his doublet , and with his head bound up in a linen cloth , arose then , and urged by the host , began to descend the stairs ; but on arriving at the kitchen , the first thing he saw was his antagonist talking calmly at the step of a heavy carriage , drawn by two large norman horses .",58
"his interlocutor , whose head appeared through the carriage window , was a woman of from twenty to two - and - twenty years .",8
"phileas fogg and his servant seated themselves in a first - class carriage at twenty minutes before nine ; five minutes later the whistle screamed , and the train slowly glided out of the station .",12
"two hours after leaving the nautilus , we had cleared the timberline , and 100 feet above our heads stood the mountain peak , forming a dark silhouette against the brilliant glare that came from its far slope . petrified shrubs rambled here and there in sprawling zigzags . fish rose in a body at our feet like birds startled in tall grass . the rocky mass was gouged with impenetrable crevices , deep caves , unfathomable holes at whose far ends i could hear fearsome things moving around . my blood would curdle as i watched some enormous antenna bar my path , or saw some frightful pincer snap shut in the shadow of some cavity ! a thousand specks of light glittered in the midst of the gloom . they were the eyes of gigantic crustaceans crouching in their lairs , giant lobsters rearing up like spear carriers and moving their claws with a scrap - iron clanking , titanic crabs aiming their bodies like cannons on their carriages , and hideous devilfish intertwining their tentacles like bushes of writhing snakes .",170
"a short gallop brought them to the road of chaillot ; the day began to decline , carriages were passing and repassing . d’artagnan , keeping at some distance from his friends , darted a scrutinizing glance into every carriage that appeared , but saw no face with which he was acquainted .",39
"at nine o’clock , guided by planchet , the little cavalcade set out , taking the route the carriage had taken .",18
""" i liked bonbons too in those days , miss eyre , and i was _ croquant_--(overlook the barbarism)--_croquant _ chocolate comfits , and smoking alternately , watching meantime the equipages that rolled along the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera - house , when in an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of english horses , and distinctly seen in the brilliant city - night , i recognised the ' voiture ' i had given celine .",49
""" oh , certainly ; he is a noble of very lofty carriage , black hair , swarthy complexion , piercing eye , white teeth , and has a scar on his temple . """,12
""" a scar on his temple ! "" cried d’artagnan ; "" and with that , white teeth , a piercing eye , dark complexion , black hair , and haughty carriage -- why , that ’s my man of meung . """,31
"besides , the appearance of the caravan was formidable . the black horses of the musketeers , their martial carriage , with the regimental step of these noble companions of the soldier , would have betrayed the most strict incognito .",19
"yes -- just one of your tricks : not to send for a carriage , and come clattering over street and road like a common mortal , but to steal into the vicinage of your home along with twilight , just as if you were a dream or a shade .",13
""" i hope that this will not happen again , "" said phileas fogg coldly , as he got into the train . poor passepartout , quite crestfallen , followed his master without a word . fix was on the point of entering another carriage , when an idea struck him which induced him to alter his plan .",44
"let the reader add , to complete the picture , refined features ; a complexion , if pale , clear ; and a stately air and carriage , and he will have , at least , as clearly as words can give it , a correct idea of the exterior of miss temple -- maria temple , as i afterwards saw the name written in a prayer - book intrusted to me to carry to church .",26
our friends had already secured a first - class carriage and were waiting for us upon the platform .,9
""" are you ? then your wish is easily granted , for there is your first sight of the moor , "" said dr . mortimer , pointing out of the carriage window .",31
"it was but too true that the railway came to a termination at this point . the papers were like some watches , which have a way of getting too fast , and had been premature in their announcement of the completion of the line . the greater part of the travellers were aware of this interruption , and , leaving the train , they began to engage such vehicles as the village could provide four - wheeled palkigharis , waggons drawn by zebus , carriages that looked like perambulating pagodas , palanquins , ponies , and what not . mr . fogg and sir francis cromarty , after searching the village from end to end , came back without having found anything .",85
""" stupid fellow yourself ! "" said d’artagnan , stooping in his turn on the neck of his horse , and answering on his side through the carriage window . "" i do not go on because it pleases me to stop here . """,27
""" if i should happen to be any distance from you when the carriage comes for you -- at dinner or supper , for instance ? """,13
"her carriage was that of a queen or a goddess ; her eyes , which cast the brilliancy of emeralds , were perfectly beautiful , and yet were at the same time full of sweetness and majesty .",1
"soon after , phileas fogg , sir francis cromarty , and passepartout , installed in a carriage with aouda , who had the best seat , were whirling at full speed towards benares . it was a run of eighty miles , and was accomplished in two hours . during the journey , the young woman fully recovered her senses .",16
"the stillness of early morning slumbered everywhere ; the curtains were yet drawn over the servants ' chamber windows ; little birds were just twittering in the blossom - blanched orchard trees , whose boughs drooped like white garlands over the wall enclosing one side of the yard ; the carriage horses stamped from time to time in their closed stables : all else was still .",50
"he jumped up and seized her roughly by the arm . "" show him to me . which is he ? point him out . i must see him ! "" he exclaimed ; but at that moment the duke of berwick 's four - in - hand came between , and when it had left the space clear , the carriage had swept out of the park .",61
"mr . fogg , aouda , and passepartout were conducted to a palkigahri , a sort of four - wheeled carriage , drawn by two horses , in which they took their places and were driven away . no one spoke during the twenty minutes which elapsed before they reached their destination . they first passed through the "" black town , "" with its narrow streets , its miserable , dirty huts , and squalid population ; then through the "" european town , "" which presented a relief in its bright brick mansions , shaded by coconut - trees and bristling with masts , where , although it was early morning , elegantly dressed horsemen and handsome equipages were passing back and forth .",20
""" the moment for which i had waited so long had at last come . i had my enemies within my power . together they could protect each other , but singly they were at my mercy . i did not act , however , with undue precipitation . my plans were already formed . there is no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes him , and why retribution has come upon him . i had my plans arranged by which i should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out . it chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in the brixton road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage . it was claimed that same evening , and returned ; but in the interval i had taken a moulding of it , and had a duplicate constructed . by means of this i had access to at least one spot in this great city where i could rely upon being free from interruption . how to get drebber to that house was the difficult problem which i had now to solve .",144
""" now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find everything else for yourself . now let me endeavour to show you the different steps in my reasoning . to begin at the beginning . i approached the house , as you know , on foot , and with my mind entirely free from all impressions . i naturally began by examining the roadway , and there , as i have already explained to you , i saw clearly the marks of a cab , which , i ascertained by inquiry , must have been there during the night . i satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels . the ordinary london growler is considerably less wide than a gentleman 's brougham .",119
"the three men brought the carriage up quietly , and took out of it a little man , stout , short , elderly , and commonly dressed in clothes of a dark color , who ascended the ladder very carefully , looked suspiciously in at the window of the pavilion , came down as quietly as he had gone up , and whispered , ’ it is she ! ’",5
"two of the men appeared , bearing the woman in their arms , and carried her to the carriage , into which the little old man got after her .",18
"the leader closed the window , came out an instant after by the door , and satisfied himself that the woman was in the carriage .",24
"the rangoon was moored half a mile off in the harbour , its signal of departure hoisted at the mast - head . eleven o'clock was striking ; mr . fogg was an hour in advance of time . fix saw them leave the carriage and push off in a boat for the steamer , and stamped his feet with disappointment .",44
