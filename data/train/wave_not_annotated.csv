"i 'm not sure that conseil heeded my recommendation , because he seemed to be deep in thought , no doubt trying to calculate how many one - fifths of a millimeter are found in forty square miles . as for me , i continued to observe this phenomenon . for several hours the nautilus 's spur sliced through these whitish waves , and i watched it glide noiselessly over this soapy water , as if it were cruising through those foaming eddies that a bay 's currents and countercurrents sometimes leave between each other .",61
"near midnight the sea suddenly resumed its usual hue , but behind us all the way to the horizon , the skies kept mirroring the whiteness of those waves and for a good while seemed imbued with the hazy glow of an aurora borealis .",28
"she allowed , therefore , half an hour to pass away ; and as at that moment all was silence in the old castle , as nothing was heard but the eternal murmur of the waves -- that immense breaking of the ocean -- with her pure , harmonious , and powerful voice , she began the first couplet of the psalm then in great favor with the puritans :",35
the first waves of lava which fell in the lake immediately solidified and accumulated so as speedily to emerge from it .,2
"there , in place of natural wonders , the watery mass offered some thrilling and dreadful scenes to my eyes . in essence , we were then crossing that part of the whole mediterranean so fertile in casualties . from the coast of algiers to the beaches of provence , how many ships have wrecked , how many vessels have vanished ! compared to the vast liquid plains of the pacific , the mediterranean is a mere lake , but it 's an unpredictable lake with fickle waves , today kindly and affectionate to those frail single - masters drifting between a double ultramarine of sky and water , tomorrow bad - tempered and turbulent , agitated by the winds , demolishing the strongest ships beneath sudden waves that smash down with a headlong wallop .",87

"the weather was bad during the latter days of the voyage . the wind , obstinately remaining in the north - west , blew a gale , and retarded the steamer . the rangoon rolled heavily and the passengers became impatient of the long , monstrous waves which the wind raised before their path .",46
"fix did not look at the state of things in the same light . the storm greatly pleased him . his satisfaction would have been complete had the rangoon been forced to retreat before the violence of wind and waves . each delay filled him with hope , for it became more and more probable that fogg would be obliged to remain some days at hong kong ; and now the heavens themselves became his allies , with the gusts and squalls . it mattered not that they made him sea - sick -- he made no account of this inconvenience ; and , whilst his body was writhing under their effects , his spirit bounded with hopeful exultation .",39
"on the 18th , a wave swept completely over the "" bonadventure "" ; and if the crew had not taken the precaution of lashing themselves to the deck , they would have been carried away .",5
""" i never tilt against beauty , "" he said , with a wave of his hand .",13
"ned land pulled out his handkerchief to wave it in the air . but he had barely unfolded it when he was felled by an iron fist , and despite his great strength , he tumbled to the deck .",7
"in that place the fiord was at least three english miles wide ; the waves rolled with a rushing din upon the sharp - pointed rocks ; this inlet was confined between walls of rock , precipices crowned by sharp peaks 2,000 feet high , and remarkable for the brown strata which separated the beds of reddish tuff . however much i might respect the intelligence of our quadrupeds , i hardly cared to put it to the test by trusting myself to it on horseback across an arm of the sea .",14
"just then a fairly loud hissing told me that the ballast tanks were filling , and the nautilus sank beneath the waves of the atlantic .",21
"part of the night passed without incident . we kept watch for an opportunity to take action . we talked little , being too keyed up . ned land was all for jumping overboard . i forced him to wait . as i saw it , the nautilus would attack the double - decker on the surface of the waves , and then it would be not only possible but easy to escape .",59
"the canadian leaped up the steps , but i stopped him . a well - known hissing told me that water was entering the ship 's ballast tanks . indeed , in a few moments the nautilus had submerged some meters below the surface of the waves .",46
""" and yet , "" continued lord henry , in his low , musical voice , and with that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of him , and that he had even in his eton days , "" i believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and completely , were to give form to every feeling , expression to every thought , reality to every dream -- i believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism , and return to the hellenic ideal-- to something finer , richer than the hellenic ideal , it may be . but the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself . the mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self - denial that mars our lives . we are punished for our refusals .",20
"the voyagers , clinging to the net , were still too heavy for it , and soon , half plunged into the sea , they were beaten by the furious waves .",30
"the captain stood up and invited me to follow him . i 'd had time to collect myself . i did so . the lounge was dark , but the sea 's waves sparkled through the transparent windows . i stared .",32
""" well , uncle , we are going to resume the northern route , and to pass under the north countries of europe -- under sweden , russia , siberia : who knows where?--instead of burrowing under the deserts of africa , or perhaps the waves of the atlantic ; and that is all i want to know . """,45
"she broke forth as never moon yet burst from cloud : a hand first penetrated the sable folds and waved them away ; then , not a moon , but a white human form shone in the azure , inclining a glorious brow earthward .",19
"we all three fell down flat . in less than a second we were in deep , unfathomable darkness . then i felt as if not only myself but the raft also had no support beneath . i thought it was sinking ; but it was not so . i wanted to speak to my uncle , but the roaring of the waves prevented him from hearing even the sound of my voice .",62
""" sir , "" captain nemo said , showing me the instruments hanging on the walls of his stateroom , "" these are the devices needed to navigate the nautilus . here , as in the lounge , i always have them before my eyes , and they indicate my position and exact heading in the midst of the ocean . you 're familiar with some of them , such as the thermometer , which gives the temperature inside the nautilus ; the barometer , which measures the heaviness of the outside air and forecasts changes in the weather ; the humidistat , which indicates the degree of dryness in the atmosphere ; the storm glass , whose mixture decomposes to foretell the arrival of tempests ; the compass , which steers my course ; the sextant , which takes the sun 's altitude and tells me my latitude ; chronometers , which allow me to calculate my longitude ; and finally , spyglasses for both day and night , enabling me to scrutinize every point of the horizon once the nautilus has risen to the surface of the waves . """,189
"as we moved forward , i heard a kind of pitter - patter above my head . sometimes this noise increased and became a continuous crackle . i soon realized the cause . it was a heavy rainfall rattling on the surface of the waves . instinctively i worried that i might get soaked ! by water in the midst of water ! i could n't help smiling at this outlandish notion . but to tell the truth , wearing these heavy diving suits , you no longer feel the liquid element , you simply think you 're in the midst of air a little denser than air on land , that 's all .",44
"three o'clock then sounded . the harbor pilot went down into his dinghy and rejoined a little schooner waiting for him to leeward . the furnaces were stoked ; the propeller churned the waves more swiftly ; the frigate skirted the flat , yellow coast of long island ; and at eight o'clock in the evening , after the lights of fire island had vanished into the northwest , we ran at full steam onto the dark waters of the atlantic .",33
"then could candide and martin plainly perceive a hundred men on the deck of the vessel which was sinking , who , with hands uplifted to heaven , sent forth piercing cries , and were in a moment swallowed up by the waves .",42
"during the first days , they went along smoothly enough . the sea was not very unpropitious , the wind seemed stationary in the north - east , the sails were hoisted , and the henrietta ploughed across the waves like a real trans - atlantic steamer .",39
"this was a misfortune . mr . fogg , in order not to deviate from his course , furled his sails and increased the force of the steam ; but the vessel 's speed slackened , owing to the state of the sea , the long waves of which broke against the stern . she pitched violently , and this retarded her progress . the breeze little by little swelled into a tempest , and it was to be feared that the henrietta might not be able to maintain herself upright on the waves .",46

"passepartout 's visage darkened with the skies , and for two days the poor fellow experienced constant fright . but phileas fogg was a bold mariner , and knew how to maintain headway against the sea ; and he kept on his course , without even decreasing his steam . the henrietta , when she could not rise upon the waves , crossed them , swamping her deck , but passing safely . sometimes the screw rose out of the water , beating its protruding end , when a mountain of water raised the stern above the waves ; but the craft always kept straight ahead .",60

"i did n't reply , and while staring at these suspicious waves , i began to put on my heavy aquatic clothes , helped by the longboat 's sailors . captain nemo and my two companions suited up as well . none of the nautilus 's men were to go with us on this new excursion .",11
"they traversed these somber galleries , waving lighted torches ; they examined the smallest excavations ; they sounded the shallowest depths , but all was dark and silent .",6
"one day solon was conversing with some elderly wise men in the egyptian capital of sais , a town already 8,000 years of age , as documented by the annals engraved on the sacred walls of its temples . one of these elders related the history of another town 1,000 years older still . this original city of athens , ninety centuries old , had been invaded and partly destroyed by the atlanteans . these atlanteans , he said , resided on an immense continent greater than africa and asia combined , taking in an area that lay between latitude 12 degrees and 40 degrees north . their dominion extended even to egypt . they tried to enforce their rule as far as greece , but they had to retreat before the indomitable resistance of the hellenic people . centuries passed . a cataclysm occurred -- floods , earthquakes . a single night and day were enough to obliterate this atlantis , whose highest peaks ( madeira , the azores , the canaries , the cape verde islands ) still emerge above the waves .",183
"the sun was already sending sufficient light under these waves . the tiniest objects remained visible . after ten minutes of walking , we were in five meters of water , and the terrain had become almost flat .",9
"oh , why was i so short of time ! i would have gone down the steep slopes of this mountain , crossed this entire immense continent , which surely connects africa with america , and visited its great prehistoric cities . under my eyes there perhaps lay the warlike town of makhimos or the pious village of eusebes , whose gigantic inhabitants lived for whole centuries and had the strength to raise blocks of stone that still withstood the action of the waters . one day perhaps , some volcanic phenomenon will bring these sunken ruins back to the surface of the waves ! numerous underwater volcanoes have been sighted in this part of the ocean , and many ships have felt terrific tremors when passing over these turbulent depths . a few have heard hollow noises that announced some struggle of the elements far below , others have hauled in volcanic ash hurled above the waves . as far as the equator this whole seafloor is still under construction by plutonic forces . and in some remote epoch , built up by volcanic disgorgings and successive layers of lava , who knows whether the peaks of these fire - belching mountains may reappear above the surface of the atlantic !",103

"in the midst of this moving vegetation , under arbors of water plants , there raced legions of clumsy articulates , in particular some fanged frog crabs whose carapaces form a slightly rounded triangle , robber crabs exclusive to these waterways , and horrible parthenope crabs whose appearance was repulsive to the eye . one animal no less hideous , which i encountered several times , was the enormous crab that mr . darwin observed , to which nature has given the instinct and requisite strength to eat coconuts ; it scrambles up trees on the beach and sends the coconuts tumbling ; they fracture in their fall and are opened by its powerful pincers . here , under these clear waves , this crab raced around with matchless agility , while green turtles from the species frequenting the malabar coast moved sluggishly among the crumbling rocks .",121
"nightfall did n't interrupt my observations . i was left to myself . conseil had repaired to his cabin . the nautilus slowed down , hovering above the muddled masses on the seafloor , sometimes grazing them as if wanting to come to rest , sometimes rising unpredictably to the surface of the waves . then i glimpsed a few bright constellations through the crystal waters , specifically five or six of those zodiacal stars trailing from the tail end of orion .",53
"he waved his hand , and they scampered away downstairs like so many rats , and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street .",1
"several times , one or other of the settlers descended to the beach in the midst of ice which the waves heaped up at each tide , but they soon climbed up again to granite house , and it was not without pain and difficulty that their hands could hold to the rounds of the ladder .",20
"i observed him with great care . his movements were systematically executed , and for half an hour no danger seemed to threaten him . so i had gotten used to the sight of this fascinating fishing when all at once , just as the indian was kneeling on the seafloor , i saw him make a frightened gesture , stand , and gather himself to spring back to the surface of the waves . i understood his fear . a gigantic shadow appeared above the poor diver . it was a shark of huge size , moving in diagonally , eyes ablaze , jaws wide open !",73
"the shark bellowed , so to speak . blood was pouring into the waves from its wounds . the sea was dyed red , and through this opaque liquid i could see nothing else .",13
"here , bridges were thrown from one rock to another ; there , arches like those of a wave , into the depths of which the eye could not penetrate ; in one place , large vaulted excavations presented a monumental aspect ; in another , a crowd of columns , spires , and arches , such as no gothic cathedral ever possessed .",18
"in order to make one ’s way amid these turbulent and conflicting waves , it was necessary to be an officer , a great noble , or a pretty woman .",12
"and this reaction was n't long in coming . for three months , during which each day seemed like a century , the abraham lincoln plowed all the northerly seas of the pacific , racing after whales sighted , abruptly veering off course , swerving sharply from one tack to another , stopping suddenly , putting on steam and reversing engines in quick succession , at the risk of stripping its gears , and it did n't leave a single point unexplored from the beaches of japan to the coasts of america . and we found nothing ! nothing except an immenseness of deserted waves ! nothing remotely resembling a gigantic narwhale , or an underwater islet , or a derelict shipwreck , or a runaway reef , or anything the least bit unearthly !",104
"but i tell you -- and you may mark my words -- you will come some day to a craggy pass in the channel , where the whole of life 's stream will be broken up into whirl and tumult , foam and noise : either you will be dashed to atoms on crag points , or lifted up and borne on by some master - wave into a calmer current -- as i am now .",66
"she had then on a dark - blue silk dress ; her arms and her neck were bare ; her only ornament was her chestnut tresses , which waved over her shoulders with all the wild grace of natural curls .",28
"after leaving this gulf we raised muscat for an instant , the most important town in the country of oman . i marveled at its strange appearance in the midst of the black rocks surrounding it , against which the white of its houses and forts stood out sharply . i spotted the rounded domes of its mosques , the elegant tips of its minarets , and its fresh , leafy terraces . but it was only a fleeting vision , and the nautilus soon sank beneath the dark waves of these waterways .",89
"three - quarters of an hour later , we had completed our circular stroll and were back on board . just then the crewmen finished loading the sodium supplies , and the nautilus could have departed immediately . but captain nemo gave no orders . would he wait for nightfall and exit through his underwater passageway in secrecy ? perhaps . be that as it may , by the next day the nautilus had left its home port and was navigating well out from any shore , a few meters beneath the waves of the atlantic .",92
"the hatches were opened -- or torn off , if you prefer -- and waves of clean air were admitted into every part of the nautilus .",14
"such was the region our nautilus was visiting just then : a genuine prairie , a tightly woven carpet of algae , gulfweed , and bladder wrack so dense and compact a craft 's stempost could n't tear through it without difficulty . accordingly , not wanting to entangle his propeller in this weed - choked mass , captain nemo stayed at a depth some meters below the surface of the waves .",71
"the platform emerged only eighty centimeters above the waves . the nautilus 's bow and stern boasted that spindle - shaped outline that had caused the ship to be compared appropriately to a long cigar . i noted the slight overlap of its sheet - iron plates , which resembled the scales covering the bodies of our big land reptiles . so i had a perfectly natural explanation for why , despite the best spyglasses , this boat had always been mistaken for a marine animal .",8
but the colonists were yet able to follow its descent through the waves .,12
"there , a mile and a half from the frigate , a long blackish body emerged a meter above the waves . quivering violently , its tail was creating a considerable eddy . never had caudal equipment thrashed the sea with such power . an immense wake of glowing whiteness marked the animal 's track , sweeping in a long curve .",20
"the next day , april 1 , when the nautilus rose to the surface of the waves a few minutes before noon , we raised land to the west . it was tierra del fuego , the land of fire , a name given it by early navigators after they saw numerous curls of smoke rising from the natives ' huts . this land of fire forms a huge cluster of islands over thirty leagues long and eighty leagues wide , extending between latitude 53 degrees and 56 degrees south , and between longitude 67 degrees 50 ' and 77 degrees 15 ' west . its coastline looked flat , but high mountains rose in the distance . i even thought i glimpsed mt . sarmiento , whose elevation is 2,070 meters above sea level : a pyramid - shaped block of shale with a very sharp summit , which , depending on whether it 's clear or veiled in vapor , "" predicts fair weather or foul , "" as ned land told me .",16
"the transparency of salt water has long been recognized . its clarity is believed to exceed that of spring water . the mineral and organic substances it holds in suspension actually increase its translucency . in certain parts of the caribbean sea , you can see the sandy bottom with startling distinctness as deep as 145 meters down , and the penetrating power of the sun 's rays seems to give out only at a depth of 300 meters . but in this fluid setting traveled by the nautilus , our electric glow was being generated in the very heart of the waves . it was no longer illuminated water , it was liquid light .",102
at length the fog gradually unrolled itself in great heavily moving waves .,11
"and if professor toussenel is correct , this plague is nothing compared to the scourge that will strike our descendants once the seas are depopulated of whales and seals . by then , crowded with jellyfish , squid , and other devilfish , the oceans will have become huge centers of infection , because their waves will no longer possess "" these huge stomachs that god has entrusted with scouring the surface of the sea . """,55
"about twelve , immense shoals of seaweeds came in sight . i was aware of the great powers of vegetation that characterise these plants , which grow at a depth of twelve thousand feet , reproduce themselves under a pressure of four hundred atmospheres , and sometimes form barriers strong enough to impede the course of a ship . but never , i think , were such seaweeds as those which we saw floating in immense waving lines upon the sea of liedenbrock .",76
"our raft skirted the whole length of the fuci , three or four thousand feet long , undulating like vast serpents beyond the reach of sight ; i found some amusement in tracing these endless waves , always thinking i should come to the end of them , and for hours my patience was vying with my surprise .",35
"its fishing finished , the nautilus drew nearer to the coast . in this locality a number of sea turtles were sleeping on the surface of the waves . it would have been difficult to capture these valuable reptiles , because they wake up at the slightest sound , and their solid carapaces are harpoon - proof . but our suckerfish would effect their capture with extraordinary certainty and precision . in truth , this animal is a living fishhook , promising wealth and happiness to the greenest fisherman in the business .",27
"as long as the procurator ’s wife could follow him with her eyes , she waved her handkerchief to him , leaning so far out of the window as to lead people to believe she wished to precipitate herself .",15
"porthos received all these attentions like a man accustomed to such demonstrations , only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his hat gracefully , and waved it to her as a sign of adieu .",28
"there once more , through the panels opening into these caribbean waters ten meters below the surface of the waves , i found so many fascinating exhibits to describe in my daily notes ! among other zoophytes there were portuguese men - of - war known by the name physalia pelagica , like big , oblong bladders with a pearly sheen , spreading their membranes to the wind , letting their blue tentacles drift like silken threads ; to the eye delightful jellyfish , to the touch actual nettles that ooze a corrosive liquid . among the articulates there were annelid worms one and a half meters long , furnished with a pink proboscis , equipped with 1,700 organs of locomotion , snaking through the waters , and as they went , throwing off every gleam in the solar spectrum . from the fish branch there were manta rays , enormous cartilaginous fish ten feet long and weighing 600 pounds , their pectoral fin triangular , their midback slightly arched , their eyes attached to the edges of the face at the front of the head ; they floated like wreckage from a ship , sometimes fastening onto our windows like opaque shutters . there were american triggerfish for which nature has ground only black and white pigments , feather - shaped gobies that were long and plump with yellow fins and jutting jaws , sixteen - decimeter mackerel with short , sharp teeth , covered with small scales , and related to the albacore species . next came swarms of red mullet corseted in gold stripes from head to tail , their shining fins all aquiver , genuine masterpieces of jewelry , formerly sacred to the goddess diana , much in demand by rich romans , and about which the old saying goes : "" he who catches them does n't eat them ! "" finally , adorned with emerald ribbons and dressed in velvet and silk , golden angelfish passed before our eyes like courtiers in the paintings of veronese ; spurred gilthead stole by with their swift thoracic fins ; thread herring fifteen inches long were wrapped in their phosphorescent glimmers ; gray mullet thrashed the sea with their big fleshy tails ; red salmon seemed to mow the waves with their slicing pectorals ; and silver moonfish , worthy of their name , rose on the horizon of the waters like the whitish reflections of many moons .",19

"the "" bonadventure "" was already a quarter of a mile from the coast when the passengers perceived on the heights of granite house two men waving their farewells ; they were cyrus harding and neb .",26
"we were seated on the platform next to a tranquil sea . the month of march , since it 's the equivalent of october in these latitudes , was giving us some fine autumn days . it was the canadian-- on this topic he was never mistaken -- who sighted a baleen whale on the eastern horizon . if you looked carefully , you could see its blackish back alternately rise and fall above the waves , five miles from the nautilus .",75
"there was a stifled groan and the horrible sound of some one choking with blood . three times the outstretched arms shot up convulsively , waving grotesque , stiff - fingered hands in the air . he stabbed him twice more , but the man did not move . something began to trickle on the floor . he waited for a moment , still pressing the head down . then he threw the knife on the table , and listened .",25
"immense waves threatened to overwhelm the island , and certainly any vessel anchored near the shore would have been dashed to pieces .",1
"i pressed her in my arms and took my place in the carriage . martha and the young girl , standing at the door , waved their last farewell . then the horses , roused by the driver 's whistling , darted off at a gallop on the road to altona .",25
"under the woods which skirted the glade on the left they could hear the bushes rustling and see the grass waving , which indicated the presence of timid animals , but still nothing to show that the island was inhabited .",20
""" no , sir . accordingly , i 'm in the habit of staying in the pilothouse and directing maneuvers myself . and now if you 'll kindly go below , professor aronnax , the nautilus is about to sink beneath the waves , and it will only return to the surface after we 've cleared the arabian tunnel . """,42
finally this mass of sperm whales thinned out . the waves grew tranquil again . i felt us rising to the surface of the ocean . the hatch opened and we rushed onto the platform .,10
"on january 16 the nautilus seemed to have fallen asleep just a few meters beneath the surface of the water . its electric equipment had been turned off , and the motionless propeller let it ride with the waves . i assumed that the crew were busy with interior repairs , required by the engine 's strenuous mechanical action .",38
"some magic lay behind this dazzling sight ! perhaps some atmospheric condition had intensified this phenomenon ? perhaps a storm had been unleashed on the surface of the waves ? but only a few meters down , the nautilus felt no tempest 's fury , and the ship rocked peacefully in the midst of the calm waters .",28
"at sunrise the next morning , february 12 , the nautilus rose to the surface of the waves . i rushed onto the platform . the hazy silhouette of pelusium was outlined three miles to the south . a torrent had carried us from one sea to the other . but although that tunnel was easy to descend , going back up must have been impossible .",17
"the chevalier raised his head , saw the two young women , and without stopping , waved his hand in a friendly way to milady .",16
"by then the nautilus had returned to the surface of the waves . stationed on the top steps , one of the seamen undid the bolts of the hatch . but he had scarcely unscrewed the nuts when the hatch flew up with tremendous violence , obviously pulled open by the suckers on a devilfish 's arm .",11
"the temperature was fairly low . exposed to the outside air , the thermometer marked -2 degrees to -3 degrees centigrade . but we were warmly dressed in furs , for which seals and aquatic bears had paid the price . evenly heated by all its electric equipment , the nautilus 's interior defied the most intense cold . moreover , to find a bearable temperature , the ship had only to sink just a few meters beneath the waves .",79
"in a few minutes the schooner , under her mizen , brigantine , topsail , and topgallant sail , loosed from her moorings and made full sail through the straits . in an hour the capital of denmark seemed to sink below the distant waves , and the _ valkyria _ was skirting the coast by elsinore . in my nervous frame of mind i expected to see the ghost of hamlet wandering on the legendary castle terrace .",44
"so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice , every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close , and waving their forepaws to mark the time , while the mock turtle sang this , very slowly and sadly :",25
"just then the gulf stream 's speed was 2.25 meters per second . so distinct is its current from the surrounding sea , its confined waters stand out against the ocean and operate on a different level from the colder waters . murky as well , and very rich in saline material , their pure indigo contrasts with the green waves surrounding them . moreover , their line of demarcation is so clear that abreast of the carolinas , the nautilus 's spur cut the waves of the gulf stream while its propeller was still churning those belonging to the ocean .",60
"jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive glance of some stranger . he had that dislike of being stared at , which comes on geniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace . sibyl , however , was quite unconscious of the effect she was producing . her love was trembling in laughter on her lips . she was thinking of prince charming , and , that she might think of him all the more , she did not talk of him , but prattled on about the ship in which jim was going to sail , about the gold he was certain to find , about the wonderful heiress whose life he was to save from the wicked , red - shirted bushrangers . for he was not to remain a sailor , or a supercargo , or whatever he was going to be . oh , no ! a sailor 's existence was dreadful . fancy being cooped up in a horrid ship , with the hoarse , hump - backed waves trying to get in , and a black wind blowing the masts down and tearing the sails into long screaming ribands !",178
"yes ; who but he ? such an expedient , however simple , would never have entered into our minds . true , it seemed most hazardous to strike a blow of the hammer in this part of the earth 's structure . suppose some displacement should occur and crush us all ! suppose the torrent , bursting through , should drown us in a sudden flood ! there was nothing vain in these fancies . but still no fears of falling rocks or rushing floods could stay us now ; and our thirst was so intense that , to satisfy it , we would have dared the waves of the north atlantic .",108
"we were walking on sand that was fine - grained and smooth , not wrinkled like beach sand , which preserves the impressions left by the waves . this dazzling carpet was a real mirror , throwing back the sun 's rays with startling intensity . the outcome : an immense vista of reflections that penetrated every liquid molecule . will anyone believe me if i assert that at this thirty - foot depth , i could see as if it was broad daylight ?",26
"after renewing its air , the nautilus stayed at an average depth of fifteen meters , enabling it to return quickly to the surface of the waves . and , contrary to custom , it executed such a maneuver several times during that day of january 19 . the chief officer would then climb onto the platform , and his usual phrase would ring through the ship 's interior .",26
""" excuse the admiration of a connoisseur , "" said he as he waved his hand towards the line of portraits which covered the opposite wall . "" watson wo n't allow that i know anything of art , but that is mere jealousy , because our views upon the subject differ . now , these are a really very fine series of portraits . """,13
"we had been gone from the nautilus for about an hour and a half . it was almost noon . i spotted this fact in the perpendicularity of the sun 's rays , which were no longer refracted . the magic of these solar colors disappeared little by little , with emerald and sapphire shades vanishing from our surroundings altogether . we walked with steady steps that rang on the seafloor with astonishing intensity . the tiniest sounds were transmitted with a speed to which the ear is unaccustomed on shore . in fact , water is a better conductor of sound than air , and under the waves noises carry four times as fast .",108
"a small fly or moth had fluttered across our path , and in an instant stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it . to my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire , and my acquaintance never paused for an instant , bounding from tuft to tuft behind it , his green net waving in the air . his gray clothes and jerky , zigzag , irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself . i was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the treacherous mire , when i heard the sound of steps , and turning round found a woman near me upon the path . she had come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of merripit house , but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close .",60
"scarcely has he lifted his head again before a ball of fire has bounded over the waves and lighted on board our raft . mast and sail flew up in an instant together , and i saw them carried up to prodigious height , resembling in appearance a pterodactyle , one of those strong birds of the infant world .",16
"then he returned to the rocks , against which the furious waves were beating , to save what he could . i was unable to speak . i was shattered with fatigue and excitement ; i wanted a whole hour to recover even a little .",11
""" gracious ! "" conseil put in . "" suppose one day some volcanic upheaval raises these two barriers back above the waves ! """,22
"the raging sea was swept with huge tattered clouds drenched by the waves . i saw no more of the small intervening billows that form in the troughs of the big crests . just long , soot - colored undulations with crests so compact they did n't foam . they kept growing taller . they were spurring each other on . the nautilus , sometimes lying on its side , sometimes standing on end like a mast , rolled and pitched frightfully .",12
"meanwhile i was carefully examining these unleashed breakers . they measured up to fifteen meters in height over a length of 150 to 175 meters , and the speed of their propagation ( half that of the wind ) was fifteen meters per second . their volume and power increased with the depth of the waters . i then understood the role played by these waves , which trap air in their flanks and release it in the depths of the sea where its oxygen brings life . their utmost pressure -- it has been calculated-- can build to 3,000 kilograms on every square foot of surface they strike . it was such waves in the hebrides that repositioned a stone block weighing 84,000 pounds . it was their relatives in the tidal wave on december 23 , 1854 , that toppled part of the japanese city of tokyo , then went that same day at 700 kilometers per hour to break on the beaches of america .",113

"captain nemo reentered near midnight . i could hear the ballast tanks filling little by little , and the nautilus sank gently beneath the surface of the waves .",27
"suddenly he started . his eyes grew strangely bright , and he gnawed nervously at his underlip . between two of the windows stood a large florentine cabinet , made out of ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue lapis . he watched it as though it were a thing that could fascinate and make afraid , as though it held something that he longed for and yet almost loathed . his breath quickened . a mad craving came over him . he lit a cigarette and then threw it away . his eyelids drooped till the long fringed lashes almost touched his cheek . but he still watched the cabinet . at last he got up from the sofa on which he had been lying , went over to it , and having unlocked it , touched some hidden spring . a triangular drawer passed slowly out . his fingers moved instinctively towards it , dipped in , and closed on something . it was a small chinese box of black and gold - dust lacquer , elaborately wrought , the sides patterned with curved waves , and the silken cords hung with round crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads . he opened it . inside was a green paste , waxy in lustre , the odour curiously heavy and persistent .",186
"and in truth , the ocean was deserted . not a sail on the horizon . the tips of crespo island had disappeared during the night . the sea , absorbing every color of the prism except its blue rays , reflected the latter in every direction and sported a wonderful indigo tint . the undulating waves regularly took on the appearance of watered silk with wide stripes .",56
"as i said , the nautilus veered to the east . to be more accurate , i should have said to the northeast . sometimes on the surface of the waves , sometimes beneath them , the ship wandered for days amid these mists so feared by navigators . these are caused chiefly by melting ice , which keeps the air extremely damp . how many ships have perished in these waterways as they tried to get directions from the hazy lights on the coast ! how many casualties have been caused by these opaque mists ! how many collisions have occurred with these reefs , where the breaking surf is covered by the noise of the wind ! how many vessels have rammed each other , despite their running lights , despite the warnings given by their bosun 's pipes and alarm bells !",30
"athos took off his hat , placed it on the end of his sword , and waved it in the air .",16
""" i hear a noise like the dashing of waves . the sea is below the car !",9
"but as beautiful as it was , i could get only a quick look at this basin whose surface area comprises 2,000,000 square kilometers . even captain nemo 's personal insights were denied me , because that mystifying individual did n't appear one single time during our high - speed crossing . i estimate that the nautilus covered a track of some 600 leagues under the waves of this sea , and this voyage was accomplished in just twenty - four hours times two . departing from the waterways of greece on the morning of february 16 , we cleared the strait of gibraltar by sunrise on the 18th .",66
"accordingly , our speed was twenty - five miles ( that is , twelve four - kilometer leagues ) per hour . needless to say , ned land had to give up his escape plans , much to his distress . swept along at the rate of twelve to thirteen meters per second , he could hardly make use of the skiff . leaving the nautilus under these conditions would have been like jumping off a train racing at this speed , a rash move if there ever was one . moreover , to renew our air supply , the submersible rose to the surface of the waves only at night , and relying solely on compass and log , it steered by dead reckoning .",107
"on january 25 , the ocean being completely deserted , the nautilus spent the day on the surface , churning the waves with its powerful propeller and making them spurt to great heights . under these conditions , who would n't have mistaken it for a gigantic cetacean ? i spent three - quarters of the day on the platform . i stared at the sea . nothing on the horizon , except near four o'clock in the afternoon a long steamer to the west , running on our opposite tack . its masting was visible for an instant , but it could n't have seen the nautilus because we were lying too low in the water . i imagine that steamboat belonged to the peninsular & oriental line , which provides service from the island of ceylon to sidney , also calling at king george sound and melbourne .",21
"they proceeded but slowly , frequently looking back ; but , in consequence of the inclination of the soil , the lava gained rapidly in the east , and as its lower waves became solidified others , at boiling heat , covered them immediately .",32
"during that day a fearsome school of sharks provided us with an escort . dreadful animals that teem in these seas and make them extremely dangerous . there were port jackson sharks with a brown back , a whitish belly , and eleven rows of teeth , bigeye sharks with necks marked by a large black spot encircled in white and resembling an eye , and isabella sharks whose rounded snouts were strewn with dark speckles . often these powerful animals rushed at the lounge window with a violence less than comforting . by this point ned land had lost all self - control . he wanted to rise to the surface of the waves and harpoon the monsters , especially certain smooth - hound sharks whose mouths were paved with teeth arranged like a mosaic , and some big five - meter tiger sharks that insisted on personally provoking him . but the nautilus soon picked up speed and easily left astern the fastest of these man - eaters .",114
