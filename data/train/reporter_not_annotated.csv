"ah ! if ever a reporter found himself face to face with a mystery , it is i who now speak to you , my friends ! """,5
""" and yet we are not mistaken , "" remarked the reporter .",11
"it was an instrument of excellent quality , a perfect pocket chronometer , which the reporter had not forgotten to wind up carefully every day .",15
""" stewed , "" replied the reporter , "" their flesh is equal to the best venison!-- """,6
"the reporter broke off one or two of these stalks and returned to the lad , to whom he said,--",1
"this was no other than gideon spilett , a reporter for the new york herald , who had been ordered to follow the changes of the war in the midst of the northern armies .",9
"gideon spilett ranked among the first of those reporters : a man of great merit , energetic , prompt and ready for anything , full of ideas , having traveled over the whole world , soldier and artist , enthusiastic in council , resolute in action , caring neither for trouble , fatigue , nor danger , when in pursuit of information , for himself first , and then for his journal , a perfect treasury of knowledge on all sorts of curious subjects , of the unpublished , of the unknown , and of the impossible . he was one of those intrepid observers who write under fire , "" reporting "" among bullets , and to whom every danger is welcome .",8
"this "" we "" included spilett , for the reporter , as his friend well knew , was not a man to draw back , and when the project was communicated to him he approved of it unreservedly .",9
""" forward , "" cried the reporter ; and all four , spilett , herbert , pencroft , and neb , forgetting their fatigue , began their search .",6
"thus it had been agreed that cyrus harding , neb , and gideon spilett should remain at granite house , but an objection was raised , and spilett , who had not forgotten his business as reporter to the new york herald , having declared that he would go by swimming rather than lose such an opportunity , he was admitted to take a part in the voyage .",36
the reporter listened to ascertain if the poor lad 's heart was still beating .,1
"on the reporter observing that since the table was spread for the rabbits , it was strange that the rabbits themselves should be wanting , the two sportsmen carefully explored the warren .",2
"the reporter , therefore , thought it best to simply bathe the two wounds with cold water .",1
the engineer and the reporter re - entered the house .,4
""" i will join pencroft , "" said the reporter , "" and both of us , well - armed and accompanied by top-- """,9
""" i shall be very happy , "" replied the reporter ; "" but what is it that i am going to eat ? """,10
""" well , well , "" replied the reporter , "" man is never perfect , nor contented . """,8
"it might have been remarked besides that during this period herbert remained utterly prostrate , his head weak and giddy . another symptom alarmed the reporter to the highest degree .",25
""" if before tomorrow morning we have not given him a more energetic febrifuge , "" said the reporter , "" herbert will be dead . """,18
"when the time for the third attack had passed by , he nearly suffocated the reporter in his embrace .",15
""" no , "" replied the reporter , "" it is more probable that they wander at random , and it is their interest to rove about until the time when they will be masters of the island ! """,6
