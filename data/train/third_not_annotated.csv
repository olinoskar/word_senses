"like the continents , the sea has its rivers . these are exclusive currents that can be identified by their temperature and color , the most remarkable being the one called the gulf stream . science has defined the global paths of five chief currents : one in the north atlantic , a second in the south atlantic , a third in the north pacific , a fourth in the south pacific , and a fifth in the southern indian ocean . also it 's likely that a sixth current used to exist in the northern indian ocean , when the caspian and aral seas joined up with certain large asian lakes to form a single uniform expanse of water .",60

"“ xury , ” says i , “ you shall on shore and kill him . ” xury , looked frighted , and said , “ me kill ! he eat me at one mouth!”—one mouthful he meant . however , i said no more to the boy , but bade him lie still , and i took our biggest gun , which was almost musket - bore , and loaded it with a good charge of powder , and with two slugs , and laid it down ; then i loaded another gun with two bullets ; and the third ( for we had three pieces ) i loaded with five smaller bullets . i took the best aim i could with the first piece to have shot him in the head , but he lay so with his leg raised a little above his nose , that the slugs hit his leg about the knee and broke the bone . he started up , growling at first , but finding his leg broken , fell down again ; and then got upon three legs , and gave the most hideous roar that ever i heard . i was a little surprised that i had not hit him on the head ; however , i took up the second piece immediately , and though he began to move off , fired again , and shot him in the head , and had the pleasure to see him drop and make but little noise , but lie struggling for life . then xury took heart , and would have me let him go on shore .",100
"on the ninth day after leaving yokohama , phileas fogg had traversed exactly one half of the terrestrial globe . the general grant passed , on the 23rd of november , the one hundred and eightieth meridian , and was at the very antipodes of london . mr . fogg had , it is true , exhausted fifty - two of the eighty days in which he was to complete the tour , and there were only twenty - eight left . but , though he was only half - way by the difference of meridians , he had really gone over two - thirds of the whole journey ; for he had been obliged to make long circuits from london to aden , from aden to bombay , from calcutta to singapore , and from singapore to yokohama . could he have followed without deviation the fiftieth parallel , which is that of london , the whole distance would only have been about twelve thousand miles ; whereas he would be forced , by the irregular methods of locomotion , to traverse twenty - six thousand , of which he had , on the 23rd of november , accomplished seventeen thousand five hundred . and now the course was a straight one , and fix was no longer there to put obstacles in their way !",104

"this current swept along with it a whole host of moving creatures . argonauts , so common in the mediterranean , voyaged here in schools of large numbers . among cartilaginous fish , the most remarkable were rays whose ultra slender tails made up nearly a third of the body , which was shaped like a huge diamond twenty - five feet long ; then little one - meter sharks , the head large , the snout short and rounded , the teeth sharp and arranged in several rows , the body seemingly covered with scales .",46
"the blubber , cut in parallel slices of two feet and a half in thickness , then divided into pieces which might weigh about a thousand pounds each , was melted down in large earthen pots brought to the spot , for they did not wish to taint the environs of granite house , and in this fusion it lost nearly a third of its weight .",62

"the king , however , who sought distraction , while traveling as fast as possible -- for he was anxious to be in paris by the twenty - third -- stopped from time to time to fly the magpie , a pastime for which the taste had been formerly inspired in him by de luynes , and for which he had always preserved a great predilection .",28
"at length the escort passed through paris on the twenty - third , in the night .",11
"the operation proceeded apace . yet there was one hitch . as they gradually unrolled this third cable , the electricians observed on several occasions that someone had recently driven nails into it , trying to damage its core . captain anderson , his officers , and the engineers put their heads together , then posted a warning that if the culprit were detected , he would be thrown overboard without a trial . after that , these villainous attempts were not repeated .",16
"in the midst of the watery mass , brightly lit by our electric beams , there snaked past those one - meter lampreys that are common to nearly every clime . a type of ray from the genus oxyrhynchus , five feet wide , had a white belly with a spotted , ash - gray back and was carried along by the currents like a huge , wide - open shawl . other rays passed by so quickly i could n't tell if they deserved that name "" eagle ray "" coined by the ancient greeks , or those designations of "" rat ray , "" "" bat ray , "" and "" toad ray "" that modern fishermen have inflicted on them . dogfish known as topes , twelve feet long and especially feared by divers , were racing with each other . looking like big bluish shadows , thresher sharks went by , eight feet long and gifted with an extremely acute sense of smell . dorados from the genus sparus , some measuring up to thirteen decimeters , appeared in silver and azure costumes encircled with ribbons , which contrasted with the dark color of their fins ; fish sacred to the goddess venus , their eyes set in brows of gold ; a valuable species that patronizes all waters fresh or salt , equally at home in rivers , lakes , and oceans , living in every clime , tolerating any temperature , their line dating back to prehistoric times on this earth yet preserving all its beauty from those far - off days . magnificent sturgeons , nine to ten meters long and extremely fast , banged their powerful tails against the glass of our panels , showing bluish backs with small brown spots ; they resemble sharks , without equaling their strength , and are encountered in every sea ; in the spring they delight in swimming up the great rivers , fighting the currents of the volga , danube , po , rhine , loire , and oder , while feeding on herring , mackerel , salmon , and codfish ; although they belong to the class of cartilaginous fish , they rate as a delicacy ; they 're eaten fresh , dried , marinated , or salt - preserved , and in olden times they were borne in triumph to the table of the roman epicure lucullus . but whenever the nautilus drew near the surface , those denizens of the mediterranean i could observe most productively belonged to the sixty - third genus of bony fish . these were tuna from the genus scomber , blue - black on top , silver on the belly armor , their dorsal stripes giving off a golden gleam . they are said to follow ships in search of refreshing shade from the hot tropical sun , and they did just that with the nautilus , as they had once done with the vessels of the count de la pérouse . for long hours they competed in speed with our submersible . i could n't stop marveling at these animals so perfectly cut out for racing , their heads small , their bodies sleek , spindle - shaped , and in some cases over three meters long , their pectoral fins gifted with remarkable strength , their caudal fins forked . like certain flocks of birds , whose speed they equal , these tuna swim in triangle formation , which prompted the ancients to say they 'd boned up on geometry and military strategy . and yet they ca n't escape the provençal fishermen , who prize them as highly as did the ancient inhabitants of turkey and italy ; and these valuable animals , as oblivious as if they were deaf and blind , leap right into the marseilles tuna nets and perish by the thousands .",430
