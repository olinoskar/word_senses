the judges chosen were mr . oliver and an able lawyer : both coincided in my opinion : i carried my point .,21
"while he took his sights with his sextant , one of the nautilus 's sailors-- that muscular man who had gone with us to crespo island during our first underwater excursion -- came up to clean the glass panes of the beacon . i then examined the fittings of this mechanism , whose power was increased a hundredfold by biconvex lenses that were designed like those in a lighthouse and kept its rays productively focused . this electric lamp was so constructed as to yield its maximum illuminating power . in essence , its light was generated in a vacuum , insuring both its steadiness and intensity . such a vacuum also reduced wear on the graphite points between which the luminous arc expanded . this was an important savings for captain nemo , who could n't easily renew them . but under these conditions , wear and tear were almost nonexistent .",117
"he motioned to me to look . an exclamation of astonishment burst from me . the north pole of the needle was turned to what we supposed to be the south . it pointed to the shore instead of to the open sea ! i shook the box , examined it again , it was in perfect condition . in whatever position i placed the box the needle pertinaciously returned to this unexpected quarter . therefore there seemed no reason to doubt that during the storm there had been a sudden change of wind unperceived by us , which had brought our raft back to the shore which we thought we had left so long a distance behind us .",33
"on the morning of the 24th , in latitude 12 degrees 5 ' south and longitude 94 degrees 33 ' , we raised keeling island , a madreporic upheaving planted with magnificent coconut trees , which had been visited by mr . darwin and captain fitzroy . the nautilus cruised along a short distance off the shore of this desert island . our dragnets brought up many specimens of polyps and echinoderms plus some unusual shells from the branch mollusca . captain nemo 's treasures were enhanced by some valuable exhibits from the delphinula snail species , to which i joined some pointed star coral , a sort of parasitic polypary that often attaches itself to seashells .",102
"during that day a fearsome school of sharks provided us with an escort . dreadful animals that teem in these seas and make them extremely dangerous . there were port jackson sharks with a brown back , a whitish belly , and eleven rows of teeth , bigeye sharks with necks marked by a large black spot encircled in white and resembling an eye , and isabella sharks whose rounded snouts were strewn with dark speckles . often these powerful animals rushed at the lounge window with a violence less than comforting . by this point ned land had lost all self - control . he wanted to rise to the surface of the waves and harpoon the monsters , especially certain smooth - hound sharks whose mouths were paved with teeth arranged like a mosaic , and some big five - meter tiger sharks that insisted on personally provoking him . but the nautilus soon picked up speed and easily left astern the fastest of these man - eaters .",95
"to understand this apostrophe of my uncle 's , made to absent french savants , it will be necessary to allude to an event of high importance in a palÃ¦ontological point of view , which had occurred a little while before our departure .",30

"the officer desired to have milady â€™s packages pointed out to him , and ordered them to be placed in the boat . when this operation was complete , he invited her to descend by offering her his hand .",8
"he agreed with his friends on this point , that the stranger must be either english or american , the name britannia leading them to suppose this , and , besides , through the bushy beard , and under the shaggy , matted hair , the engineer thought he could recognize the characteristic features of the anglo - saxon .",7
"at length he met a belated passenger , went up to him , and spoke a few words to him . the man he addressed recoiled with terror , and only answered the few words of the musketeer by pointing .",39
"herbert and pencroft turned the angle of the chimneys , not without having cast a look at the smoke which , just at that place , curled round a point of rock : they ascended the left bank of the river .",29

"that , too , is very clear to my vision . by straining to satisfy st . john till my sinews ache , i _ shall _ satisfy him -- to the finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations .",34
"but we could n't stop . we had to follow the captain , who headed down trails seemingly known only to himself . the seafloor rose noticeably , and when i lifted my arms , sometimes they would pass above the surface of the sea . then the level of the oysterbank would lower unpredictably . often we went around tall , pointed rocks rising like pyramids . in their dark crevices huge crustaceans , aiming their long legs like heavy artillery , watched us with unblinking eyes , while underfoot there crept millipedes , bloodworms , aricia worms , and annelid worms , whose antennas and tubular tentacles were incredibly long .",62
""" well -- well . to the main point -- the departure with me from england , the co - operation with me in my future labours -- you do not object .",8
"the officer took from the table the papers pointed out , gave them to him who asked for them , bowed to the ground , and retired .",8
"by then we had fared 16,220 miles , or 7,500 leagues , from our starting point in the seas of japan .",15
"and the baron pointed , with a slow and accusing gesture , to the left shoulder of milady , which he almost touched with his finger .",3
"dâ€™artagnan at first took these weapons for foils , and believed them to be buttoned ; but he soon perceived by certain scratches that every weapon was pointed and sharpened , and that at each of these scratches not only the spectators , but even the actors themselves , laughed like so many madmen .",27
"what would my good father say , who so strongly pointed out to me the respect due to the cardinal , if he knew i was in the society of such pagans ? """,10
i went out and approached him as he stood leaning over the little gate ; i spoke to the point at once .,19
""" i wish i could think like you , mr . spilett , "" replied pencroft ; "" unhappily , my mind is made up on this point . """,27
"the sailor 's reasoning was very just , and pointed out an incomprehensible fact , for the document appeared to have been recently written , when the colonists found it in the bottle .",9
"' and who are these ? ' said the queen , pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree ; for , you see , as they were lying on their faces , and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack , she could not tell whether they were gardeners , or soldiers , or courtiers , or three of her own children .",11
"grimaud therefore added nothing to his speech , but contented himself with pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge , announcing by this gesture the cardinal and his escort .",12

"but without taking any heed of the sword , milady endeavored to get near enough to him to stab him , and did not stop till she felt the sharp point at her throat .",30
"she then tried to seize the sword with her hands ; but dâ€™artagnan kept it free from her grasp , and presenting the point , sometimes at her eyes , sometimes at her breast , compelled her to glide behind the bedstead , while he aimed at making his retreat by the door which led to kitty â€™s apartment .",23
"the lesson had comprised part of the reign of charles i. , and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship- money , which most of them appeared unable to answer ; still , every little difficulty was solved instantly when it reached burns : her memory seemed to have retained the substance of the whole lesson , and she was ready with answers on every point .",68
"then milady attempted to tear down the doorcase , with a strength apparently above that of a woman ; but finding she could not accomplish this , she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard , the point of which repeatedly glittered through the wood .",40
"dâ€™artagnan could not restrain a smile . by this smile m. de treville judged that he had not to deal with a fool , and changing the conversation , came straight to the point .",33

""" the circumstances connected with the death of sir charles can not be said to have been entirely cleared up by the inquest , but at least enough has been done to dispose of those rumours to which local superstition has given rise . there is no reason whatever to suspect foul play , or to imagine that death could be from any but natural causes . sir charles was a widower , and a man who may be said to have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind . in spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his personal tastes , and his indoor servants at baskerville hall consisted of a married couple named barrymore , the husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper . their evidence , corroborated by that of several friends , tends to show that sir charles 's health has for some time been impaired , and points especially to some affection of the heart , manifesting itself in changes of colour , breathlessness , and acute attacks of nervous depression . dr . james mortimer , the friend and medical attendant of the deceased , has given evidence to the same effect .",159
""" the convicts first landed on the island in the neighborhood of flotsam point , and they immediately plunged into the far west forests , after crossing tadorn marsh .",13

"i did n't pronounce a word . i gaped . captain nemo took out the ingots one by one and arranged them methodically inside the chest , filling it to the top . at which point i estimate that it held more than 1,000 kilograms of gold , in other words , close to 5,000,000 francs .",35

"i knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend in those hours of intense mental concentration during which he weighed every particle of evidence , constructed alternative theories , balanced one against the other , and made up his mind as to which points were essential and which immaterial . i therefore spent the day at my club and did not return to baker street until evening . it was nearly nine o'clock when i found myself in the sitting - room once more .",46
