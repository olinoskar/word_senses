"he was not long in making his toilet . he examined himself to see if advantage had been taken of his sleep , and having found his diamond ring on his finger , his purse in his pocket , and his pistols in his belt , he rose , paid for his bottle , and went out to try if he could have any better luck in his search after his lackey than he had had the night before . the first thing he perceived through the damp gray mist was honest planchet , who , with the two horses in hand , awaited him at the door of a little blind cabaret , before which d’artagnan had passed without even a suspicion of its existence .",88
"a quarter of an hour afterwards , amidst an extraordinary turmoil of applause , sibyl vane stepped on to the stage . yes , she was certainly lovely to look at-- one of the loveliest creatures , lord henry thought , that he had ever seen . there was something of the fawn in her shy grace and startled eyes . a faint blush , like the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver , came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded enthusiastic house . she stepped back a few paces and her lips seemed to tremble . basil hallward leaped to his feet and began to applaud . motionless , and as one in a dream , sat dorian gray , gazing at her . lord henry peered through his glasses , murmuring , "" charming ! charming ! """,125
dorian gray grew pale as he watched her . he was puzzled and anxious . neither of his friends dared to say anything to him . she seemed to them to be absolutely incompetent . they were horribly disappointed .,1
"they were giants with long gray fur ; but if i am not mistaken , there exist black and red kangaroos , rock kangaroos , and rat kangaroos , which are more easy to get hold of .",5
""" i think you are wrong , basil , but i wo n't argue with you . it is only the intellectually lost who ever argue . tell me , is dorian gray very fond of you ? """,32
"as soon as it was over , dorian gray rushed behind the scenes into the greenroom . the girl was standing there alone , with a look of triumph on her face . her eyes were lit with an exquisite fire . there was a radiance about her . her parted lips were smiling over some secret of their own .",8
"the painter turned to his servant , who stood blinking in the sunlight . "" ask mr . gray to wait , parker : i shall be in in a few moments . "" the man bowed and went up the walk .",18
""" what o'clock is it , victor ? "" asked dorian gray drowsily .",11
""" oh ! my maid does that already , mr . gray , when she is annoyed with me . """,11
""" for the most trivial things , mr . gray , i assure you . usually because i come in at ten minutes to nine and tell her that i must be dressed by half - past eight . """,9
""" so i have murdered sibyl vane , "" said dorian gray , half to himself , "" murdered her as surely as if i had cut her little throat with a knife . yet the roses are not less lovely for all that . the birds sing just as happily in my garden . and to - night i am to dine with you , and then go on to the opera , and sup somewhere , i suppose , afterwards . how extraordinarily dramatic life is ! if i had read all this in a book , harry , i think i would have wept over it . somehow , now that it has happened actually , and to me , it seems far too wonderful for tears . here is the first passionate love - letter i have ever written in my life . strange , that my first passionate love - letter should have been addressed to a dead girl . can they feel , i wonder , those white silent people we call the dead ? sibyl ! can she feel , or know , or listen ? oh , harry , how i loved her once ! it seems years ago to me now . she was everything to me .",11
"a true northerner , thin , bony , lean , about forty - five years of age ; his close - cut hair and his beard , of which he only kept a thick mustache , were already getting gray .",39
"the old man , wrapped in a large black doublet , in which the whole of his slender body was concealed , was brisk and dry . his little gray eyes shone like carbuncles , and appeared , with his grinning mouth , to be the only part of his face in which life survived .",29
""" well , sir , i thought no more of the matter , and never would have done had it not been for my wife . only a few weeks ago she was cleaning out sir charles 's study -- it had never been touched since his death -- and she found the ashes of a burned letter in the back of the grate . the greater part of it was charred to pieces , but one little slip , the end of a page , hung together , and the writing could still be read , though it was gray on a black ground . it seemed to us to be a postscript at the end of the letter , and it said : ' please , please , as you are a gentleman , burn this letter , and be at the gate by ten o clock . beneath it were signed the initials l. l. """,100
beneath their eyes was spread a sheet of snow which looked gray in the dim light .,11
""" women are not always allowed a choice , "" he answered , but hardly had he finished the sentence before from the far end of the conservatory came a stifled groan , followed by the dull sound of a heavy fall . everybody started up . the duchess stood motionless in horror . and with fear in his eyes , lord henry rushed through the flapping palms to find dorian gray lying face downwards on the tiled floor in a deathlike swoon .",71
"suddenly from a lumpy tussock of old grass some twenty yards in front of them , with black - tipped ears erect and long hinder limbs throwing it forward , started a hare . it bolted for a thicket of alders . sir geoffrey put his gun to his shoulder , but there was something in the animal 's grace of movement that strangely charmed dorian gray , and he cried out at once , "" do n't shoot it , geoffrey . let it live . """,66
"it is true that the habit of a huntress became her admirably . she wore a beaver hat with blue feathers , a surtout of gray - pearl velvet , fastened with diamond clasps , and a petticoat of blue satin , embroidered with silver .",25
"there was , to be sure , father joseph , but his name was never pronounced but with a subdued voice , such was the terror inspired by his gray eminence , as the cardinal ’s familiar was called .",29
"hallward was thunderstruck . he looked at dorian gray in absolute amazement . he had never seen him like this before . the lad was actually pallid with rage . his hands were clenched , and the pupils of his eyes were like disks of blue fire . he was trembling all over .",8
"like a covey of snipe over a marsh , there rose underfoot schools of unusual fish from the genus monopterus , whose members have no fin but their tail . i recognized the javanese eel , a genuine eight - decimeter serpent with a bluish gray belly , which , without the gold lines over its flanks , could easily be confused with the conger eel . from the butterfish genus , whose oval bodies are very flat , i observed several adorned in brilliant colors and sporting a dorsal fin like a sickle , edible fish that , when dried and marinated , make an excellent dish known by the name "" karawade "" ; then some sea poachers , fish belonging to the genus aspidophoroides , whose bodies are covered with scaly armor divided into eight lengthwise sections .",45
"it was possible , i reflected , that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene , of the details of the picture , would be sufficient to modify , or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression ; and , acting upon this idea , i reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling , and gazed down — but with a shudder even more thrilling than before — upon the remodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge , and the ghastly tree - stems , and the vacant and eye - like windows .",94
""" surely that must be the same johnson whom i used to know , "" said holmes to the porter . "" a lawyer , is he not , gray - headed , and walks with a limp ? """,29
"i had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity — an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven , but which had reeked up from the decayed trees , and the gray wall , and the silent tarn — a pestilent and mystic vapor , dull , sluggish , faintly discernible , and leaden - hued .",54
"as he left the room , dorian gray smiled to himself . poor basil ! how little he knew of the true reason ! and how strange it was that , instead of having been forced to reveal his own secret , he had succeeded , almost by chance , in wresting a secret from his friend ! how much that strange confession explained to him ! the painter 's absurd fits of jealousy , his wild devotion , his extravagant panegyrics , his curious reticences-- he understood them all now , and he felt sorry . there seemed to him to be something tragic in a friendship so coloured by romance .",7
"although this man was scarcely thirty - six or thirty - seven years of age , hair , mustaches , and royal , all began to be gray .",27
he paraded his musketeers before the cardinal armand duplessis with an insolent air which made the gray moustache of his eminence curl with ire .,16
"the pen dropped from dorian gray 's hand , and he felt as if his heart had suddenly stopped beating . "" a sailor ? "" he cried out . "" did you say a sailor ? """,5
"these fine animals were as large as deer ; their horns were stronger than those of the ram , and their gray - colored fleece was mixed with long hair .",21
"perhaps he had read it and had begun to suspect something . and , yet , what did it matter ? what had dorian gray to do with sibyl vane 's death ? there was nothing to fear . dorian gray had not killed her .",24
"perhaps he had read it and had begun to suspect something . and , yet , what did it matter ? what had dorian gray to do with sibyl vane 's death ? there was nothing to fear . dorian gray had not killed her .",40
"he was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted , and whence , for many years , he had never ventured forth — in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be re - stated — an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion had , by dint of long sufferance , he said , obtained over his spirit — an effect which the physique of the gray walls and turrets , and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down , had , at length , brought about upon the morale of his existence .",88
"dorian gray shook his head and struck some soft chords on the piano . "" ' like the painting of a sorrow , ' "" he repeated , "" ' a face without a heart . ' """,1
"the music jarred , and dorian gray started and stared at his friend . "" why do you ask me that , harry ? """,6
"as for fish , they were numerous and often remarkable . here are the ones that the nautilus 's nets most frequently hauled on board : rays , including spotted rays that were oval in shape and brick red in color , their bodies strewn with erratic blue speckles and identifiable by their jagged double stings , silver - backed skates , common stingrays with stippled tails , butterfly rays that looked like huge two - meter cloaks flapping at middepth , toothless guitarfish that were a type of cartilaginous fish closer to the shark , trunkfish known as dromedaries that were one and a half feet long and had humps ending in backward - curving stings , serpentine moray eels with silver tails and bluish backs plus brown pectorals trimmed in gray piping , a species of butterfish called the fiatola decked out in thin gold stripes and the three colors of the french flag , montague blennies four decimeters long , superb jacks handsomely embellished by seven black crosswise streaks with blue and yellow fins plus gold and silver scales , snooks , standard mullet with yellow heads , parrotfish , wrasse , triggerfish , gobies , etc . , plus a thousand other fish common to the oceans we had already crossed .",132
"the least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old autocrat . his eyes looked malignantly at me , and his gray whiskers bristled like those of an angry cat .",22
"under this powerful thrust the nautilus 's hull quivered like a resonating chord , and the ship sank steadily under the waters . stationed in the lounge , the captain and i watched the needle swerving swiftly over the pressure gauge . soon we had gone below the livable zone where most fish reside . some of these animals can thrive only at the surface of seas or rivers , but a minority can dwell at fairly great depths . among the latter i observed a species of dogfish called the cow shark that 's equipped with six respiratory slits , the telescope fish with its enormous eyes , the armored gurnard with gray thoracic fins plus black pectoral fins and a breastplate protected by pale red slabs of bone , then finally the grenadier , living at a depth of 1,200 meters , by that point tolerating a pressure of 120 atmospheres .",113
"it was several miles off , but i could distinctly see a small dark dot against the dull green and gray .",20
"a twisted flash of pain shot across the painter 's face . he paused for a moment , and a wild feeling of pity came over him . after all , what right had he to pry into the life of dorian gray ? if he had done a tithe of what was rumoured about him , how much he must have suffered ! then he straightened himself up , and walked over to the fire - place , and stood there , looking at the burning logs with their frostlike ashes and their throbbing cores of flame .",42
"hallward glanced round him with a puzzled expression . the room looked as if it had not been lived in for years . a faded flemish tapestry , a curtained picture , an old italian cassone , and an almost empty book - case -- that was all that it seemed to contain , besides a chair and a table . as dorian gray was lighting a half - burned candle that was standing on the mantelshelf , he saw that the whole place was covered with dust and that the carpet was in holes . a mouse ran scuffling behind the wainscoting . there was a damp odour of mildew .",63
"it was some foul parody , some infamous ignoble satire . he had never done that . still , it was his own picture . he knew it , and he felt as if his blood had changed in a moment from fire to sluggish ice . his own picture ! what did it mean ? why had it altered ? he turned and looked at dorian gray with the eyes of a sick man . his mouth twitched , and his parched tongue seemed unable to articulate . he passed his hand across his forehead . it was dank with clammy sweat .",67
"the musketeer was introduced to m. coquenard , whose little gray eyes sparkled with anger at seeing his cousin all blazing new .",10
"calm of eye , cool of feature , an old gray - bearded gunner-- i can see him to this day -- approached the cannon , put it in position , and took aim for a good while . there was a mighty explosion , mingled with cheers from the crew .",10
"there once more , through the panels opening into these caribbean waters ten meters below the surface of the waves , i found so many fascinating exhibits to describe in my daily notes ! among other zoophytes there were portuguese men - of - war known by the name physalia pelagica , like big , oblong bladders with a pearly sheen , spreading their membranes to the wind , letting their blue tentacles drift like silken threads ; to the eye delightful jellyfish , to the touch actual nettles that ooze a corrosive liquid . among the articulates there were annelid worms one and a half meters long , furnished with a pink proboscis , equipped with 1,700 organs of locomotion , snaking through the waters , and as they went , throwing off every gleam in the solar spectrum . from the fish branch there were manta rays , enormous cartilaginous fish ten feet long and weighing 600 pounds , their pectoral fin triangular , their midback slightly arched , their eyes attached to the edges of the face at the front of the head ; they floated like wreckage from a ship , sometimes fastening onto our windows like opaque shutters . there were american triggerfish for which nature has ground only black and white pigments , feather - shaped gobies that were long and plump with yellow fins and jutting jaws , sixteen - decimeter mackerel with short , sharp teeth , covered with small scales , and related to the albacore species . next came swarms of red mullet corseted in gold stripes from head to tail , their shining fins all aquiver , genuine masterpieces of jewelry , formerly sacred to the goddess diana , much in demand by rich romans , and about which the old saying goes : "" he who catches them does n't eat them ! "" finally , adorned with emerald ribbons and dressed in velvet and silk , golden angelfish passed before our eyes like courtiers in the paintings of veronese ; spurred gilthead stole by with their swift thoracic fins ; thread herring fifteen inches long were wrapped in their phosphorescent glimmers ; gray mullet thrashed the sea with their big fleshy tails ; red salmon seemed to mow the waves with their slicing pectorals ; and silver moonfish , worthy of their name , rose on the horizon of the waters like the whitish reflections of many moons .",365
"the belief , however , was connected ( as i have previously hinted ) with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers .",16
"the canadian was not mistaken . cavorting around the nautilus was a school of triggerfish with flat bodies , grainy skins , armed with stings on their dorsal fins , and with four prickly rows of quills quivering on both sides of their tails . nothing could have been more wonderful than the skin covering them : white underneath , gray above , with spots of gold sparkling in the dark eddies of the waves . around them , rays were undulating like sheets flapping in the wind , and among these i spotted , much to my glee , a chinese ray , yellowish on its topside , a dainty pink on its belly , and armed with three stings behind its eyes ; a rare species whose very existence was still doubted in lacépède 's day , since that pioneering classifier of fish had seen one only in a portfolio of japanese drawings .",60
"in fact , it was music that had first brought him and dorian gray together -- music and that indefinable attraction that dorian seemed to be able to exercise whenever he wished-- and , indeed , exercised often without being conscious of it . they had met at lady berkshire 's the night that rubinstein played there , and after that used to be always seen together at the opera and wherever good music was going on . for eighteen months their intimacy lasted . campbell was always either at selby royal or in grosvenor square .",13
""" i had intended never to enter your house again , gray . but you said it was a matter of life and death . "" his voice was hard and cold . he spoke with slow deliberation . there was a look of contempt in the steady searching gaze that he turned on dorian . he kept his hands in the pockets of his astrakhan coat , and seemed not to have noticed the gesture with which he had been greeted .",11
"the cetacean had rammed our frigate at about eleven o'clock in the evening . i therefore calculated on eight hours of swimming until sunrise . a strenuous task , but feasible , thanks to our relieving each other . the sea was pretty smooth and barely tired us . sometimes i tried to peer through the dense gloom , which was broken only by the phosphorescent flickers coming from our movements . i stared at the luminous ripples breaking over my hands , shimmering sheets spattered with blotches of bluish gray . it seemed as if we 'd plunged into a pool of quicksilver .",90
""" stop , gray . i do n't want to know anything further . whether what you have told me is true or not true does n't concern me . i entirely decline to be mixed up in your life . keep your horrible secrets to yourself . they do n't interest me any more . """,3
"the fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface from our minds the grim and gray impression which had been left upon both of us by our first experience of baskerville hall . as sir henry and i sat at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through the high mullioned windows , throwing watery patches of colour from the coats of arms which covered them . the dark panelling glowed like bronze in the golden rays , and it was hard to realize that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such a gloom into our souls upon the evening before .",17
""" i guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to blame ! "" said the baronet . "" we were tired with our journey and chilled by our drive , so we took a gray view of the place . now we are fresh and well , so it is all cheerful once more . """,38
"sir henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast , so that the time was propitious for my excursion . it was a pleasant walk of four miles along the edge of the moor , leading me at last to a small gray hamlet , in which two larger buildings , which proved to be the inn and the house of dr . mortimer , stood high above the rest . the postmaster , who was also the village grocer , had a clear recollection of the telegram .",42
"it was a squid of colossal dimensions , fully eight meters long . it was traveling backward with tremendous speed in the same direction as the nautilus . it gazed with enormous , staring eyes that were tinted sea green . its eight arms ( or more accurately , feet ) were rooted in its head , which has earned these animals the name cephalopod ; its arms stretched a distance twice the length of its body and were writhing like the serpentine hair of the furies . you could plainly see its 250 suckers , arranged over the inner sides of its tentacles and shaped like semispheric capsules . sometimes these suckers fastened onto the lounge window by creating vacuums against it . the monster 's mouth -- a beak made of horn and shaped like that of a parrot -- opened and closed vertically . its tongue , also of horn substance and armed with several rows of sharp teeth , would flicker out from between these genuine shears . what a freak of nature ! a bird 's beak on a mollusk ! its body was spindle - shaped and swollen in the middle , a fleshy mass that must have weighed 20,000 to 25,000 kilograms . its unstable color would change with tremendous speed as the animal grew irritated , passing successively from bluish gray to reddish brown .",228
"as the chime struck one , campbell turned round , and looking at dorian gray , saw that his eyes were filled with tears . there was something in the purity and refinement of that sad face that seemed to enrage him . "" you are infamous , absolutely infamous ! "" he muttered .",14
"we had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from the road and wound away across the moor . a steep , boulder - sprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone days been cut into a granite quarry . the face which was turned towards us formed a dark cliff , with ferns and brambles growing in its niches . from over a distant rise there floated a gray plume of smoke .",75
"and in all honesty , i confess that this venturesome excursion was far from displeasing to me . i ca n't express the intensity of my amazement at the beauties of these new regions . the ice struck superb poses . here , its general effect suggested an oriental town with countless minarets and mosques . there , a city in ruins , flung to the ground by convulsions in the earth . these views were varied continuously by the sun 's oblique rays , or were completely swallowed up by gray mists in the middle of blizzards . then explosions , cave - ins , and great iceberg somersaults would occur all around us , altering the scenery like the changing landscape in a diorama .",91
"the whole steep slope was covered with gray circular rings of stone , a score of them at least .",7
"a small fly or moth had fluttered across our path , and in an instant stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it . to my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire , and my acquaintance never paused for an instant , bounding from tuft to tuft behind it , his green net waving in the air . his gray clothes and jerky , zigzag , irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself . i was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the treacherous mire , when i heard the sound of steps , and turning round found a woman near me upon the path . she had come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of merripit house , but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close .",66
"she made her brother talk of himself , his hopes , his prospects . he spoke slowly and with effort . they passed words to each other as players at a game pass counters . sibyl felt oppressed . she could not communicate her joy . a faint smile curving that sullen mouth was all the echo she could win . after some time she became silent . suddenly she caught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing lips , and in an open carriage with two ladies dorian gray drove past .",89
"among others i noted that sand goby mentioned by aristotle and commonly known by the name sea loach , which is encountered exclusively in the salty waters next to the nile delta . near them some semiphosphorescent red porgy rolled by , a variety of gilthead that the egyptians ranked among their sacred animals , lauding them in religious ceremonies when their arrival in the river 's waters announced the fertile flood season . i also noticed some wrasse known as the tapiro , three decimeters long , bony fish with transparent scales whose bluish gray color is mixed with red spots ; they 're enthusiastic eaters of marine vegetables , which gives them an exquisite flavor ; hence these tapiro were much in demand by the epicures of ancient rome , and their entrails were dressed with brains of peacock , tongue of flamingo , and testes of moray to make that divine platter that so enraptured the roman emperor vitellius .",95
"dorian gray shook his head . "" i left her in the forest of arden ; i shall find her in an orchard in verona . """,1
""" you do n't understand me , harry , "" answered the artist . "" of course i am not like him . i know that perfectly well . indeed , i should be sorry to look like him . you shrug your shoulders ? i am telling you the truth . there is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction , the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings . it is better not to be different from one 's fellows . the ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world . they can sit at their ease and gape at the play . if they know nothing of victory , they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat . they live as we all should live -- undisturbed , indifferent , and without disquiet . they neither bring ruin upon others , nor ever receive it from alien hands . your rank and wealth , harry ; my brains , such as they are -- my art , whatever it may be worth ; dorian gray 's good looks -- we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us , suffer terribly . """,190
"in the midst of the watery mass , brightly lit by our electric beams , there snaked past those one - meter lampreys that are common to nearly every clime . a type of ray from the genus oxyrhynchus , five feet wide , had a white belly with a spotted , ash - gray back and was carried along by the currents like a huge , wide - open shawl . other rays passed by so quickly i could n't tell if they deserved that name "" eagle ray "" coined by the ancient greeks , or those designations of "" rat ray , "" "" bat ray , "" and "" toad ray "" that modern fishermen have inflicted on them . dogfish known as topes , twelve feet long and especially feared by divers , were racing with each other . looking like big bluish shadows , thresher sharks went by , eight feet long and gifted with an extremely acute sense of smell . dorados from the genus sparus , some measuring up to thirteen decimeters , appeared in silver and azure costumes encircled with ribbons , which contrasted with the dark color of their fins ; fish sacred to the goddess venus , their eyes set in brows of gold ; a valuable species that patronizes all waters fresh or salt , equally at home in rivers , lakes , and oceans , living in every clime , tolerating any temperature , their line dating back to prehistoric times on this earth yet preserving all its beauty from those far - off days . magnificent sturgeons , nine to ten meters long and extremely fast , banged their powerful tails against the glass of our panels , showing bluish backs with small brown spots ; they resemble sharks , without equaling their strength , and are encountered in every sea ; in the spring they delight in swimming up the great rivers , fighting the currents of the volga , danube , po , rhine , loire , and oder , while feeding on herring , mackerel , salmon , and codfish ; although they belong to the class of cartilaginous fish , they rate as a delicacy ; they 're eaten fresh , dried , marinated , or salt - preserved , and in olden times they were borne in triumph to the table of the roman epicure lucullus . but whenever the nautilus drew near the surface , those denizens of the mediterranean i could observe most productively belonged to the sixty - third genus of bony fish . these were tuna from the genus scomber , blue - black on top , silver on the belly armor , their dorsal stripes giving off a golden gleam . they are said to follow ships in search of refreshing shade from the hot tropical sun , and they did just that with the nautilus , as they had once done with the vessels of the count de la pérouse . for long hours they competed in speed with our submersible . i could n't stop marveling at these animals so perfectly cut out for racing , their heads small , their bodies sleek , spindle - shaped , and in some cases over three meters long , their pectoral fins gifted with remarkable strength , their caudal fins forked . like certain flocks of birds , whose speed they equal , these tuna swim in triangle formation , which prompted the ancients to say they 'd boned up on geometry and military strategy . and yet they ca n't escape the provençal fishermen , who prize them as highly as did the ancient inhabitants of turkey and italy ; and these valuable animals , as oblivious as if they were deaf and blind , leap right into the marseilles tuna nets and perish by the thousands .",54
"during our absence the nets had been spread , and i observed with fascination the fish just hauled on board . the antarctic seas serve as a refuge for an extremely large number of migratory fish that flee from storms in the subpolar zones , in truth only to slide down the gullets of porpoises and seals . i noted some one - decimeter southern bullhead , a species of whitish cartilaginous fish overrun with bluish gray stripes and armed with stings , then some antarctic rabbitfish three feet long , the body very slender , the skin a smooth silver white , the head rounded , the topside furnished with three fins , the snout ending in a trunk that curved back toward the mouth . i sampled its flesh but found it tasteless , despite conseil 's views , which were largely approving .",76
