"as the dawn was just breaking , he found himself close to covent garden . the darkness lifted , and , flushed with faint fires , the sky hollowed itself into a perfect pearl . huge carts filled with nodding lilies rumbled slowly down the polished empty street . the air was heavy with the perfume of the flowers , and their beauty seemed to bring him an anodyne for his pain . he followed into the market and watched the men unloading their waggons . a white - smocked carter offered him some cherries . he thanked him , wondered why he refused to accept any money for them , and began to eat them listlessly . they had been plucked at midnight , and the coldness of the moon had entered into them .",47
"it is true that the old house stood slightly off the perpendicular , and bulged out a little towards the street ; its roof sloped a little to one side , like the cap over the left ear of a tugendbund student ; its lines wanted accuracy ; but after all , it stood firm , thanks to an old elm which buttressed it in front , and which often in spring sent its young sprays through the window panes .",20

"he quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which divided us by about half . then , still keeping a hundred yards behind , we followed into oxford street and so down regent street . once our friends stopped and stared into a shop window , upon which holmes did the same . an instant afterwards he gave a little cry of satisfaction , and , following the direction of his eager eyes , i saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which had halted on the other side of the street was now proceeding slowly onward again .",30

"i went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning 's conversation for holmes . it was evident to me that he had been very busy of late , for the notes which i had from baker street were few and short , with no comments upon the information which i had supplied and hardly any reference to my mission . no doubt his blackmailing case is absorbing all his faculties . and yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his interest . i wish that he were here .",42
"we had been sauntering slowly down regent street during this conversation , and dr . mortimer , with his companion , had long vanished in front of us .",7

""" i liked bonbons too in those days , miss eyre , and i was _ croquant_--(overlook the barbarism)--_croquant _ chocolate comfits , and smoking alternately , watching meantime the equipages that rolled along the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera - house , when in an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of english horses , and distinctly seen in the brilliant city - night , i recognised the ' voiture ' i had given celine .",36

"the worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat as hearty a breakfast as possible before leaving the carnatic ; but , as he had been walking about all day , the demands of hunger were becoming importunate . he observed that the butchers stalls contained neither mutton , goat , nor pork ; and , knowing also that it is a sacrilege to kill cattle , which are preserved solely for farming , he made up his mind that meat was far from plentiful in yokohama -- nor was he mistaken ; and , in default of butcher 's meat , he could have wished for a quarter of wild boar or deer , a partridge , or some quails , some game or fish , which , with rice , the japanese eat almost exclusively . but he found it necessary to keep up a stout heart , and to postpone the meal he craved till the following morning . night came , and passepartout re - entered the native quarter , where he wandered through the streets , lit by vari - coloured lanterns , looking on at the dancers , who were executing skilful steps and boundings , and the astrologers who stood in the open air with their telescopes . then he came to the harbour , which was lit up by the resin torches of the fishermen , who were fishing from their boats .",180

"at the fifty - fifth , a loud cry was heard in the street , followed by applause , hurrahs , and some fierce growls .",13
"passepartout went on his errand enchanted . he soon reached the clergyman 's house , but found him not at home . passepartout waited a good twenty minutes , and when he left the reverend gentleman , it was thirty - five minutes past eight . but in what a state he was ! with his hair in disorder , and without his hat , he ran along the street as never man was seen to run before , overturning passers - by , rushing over the sidewalk like a waterspout .",69

"i do n't know what i expected , but i went out and wandered eastward , soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black grassless squares . about half - past eight i passed by an absurd little theatre , with great flaring gas - jets and gaudy play - bills . a hideous jew , in the most amazing waistcoat i ever beheld in my life , was standing at the entrance , smoking a vile cigar . he had greasy ringlets , and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled shirt . 'have a box , my lord ? ' he said , when he saw me , and he took off his hat with an air of gorgeous servility .",25

"for five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he had already traversed on horseback . at night he flung himself down among the rocks , and snatched a few hours of sleep ; but before daybreak he was always well on his way . on the sixth day , he reached the eagle cañon , from which they had commenced their ill - fated flight . thence he could look down upon the home of the saints . worn and exhausted , he leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him . as he looked at it , he observed that there were flags in some of the principal streets , and other signs of festivity . he was still speculating as to what this might mean when he heard the clatter of horse 's hoofs , and saw a mounted man riding towards him . as he approached , he recognized him as a mormon named cowper , to whom he had rendered services at different times . he therefore accosted him when he got up to him , with the object of finding out what lucy ferrier 's fate had been .",122

"his mother was waiting for him below . she grumbled at his unpunctuality , as he entered . he made no answer , but sat down to his meagre meal . the flies buzzed round the table and crawled over the stained cloth . through the rumble of omnibuses , and the clatter of street - cabs , he could hear the droning voice devouring each minute that was left to him .",54

"many citizens , seeing the women flying toward the high street , leaving their children crying at the open doors , hastened to don the cuirass , and supporting their somewhat uncertain courage with a musket or a partisan , directed their steps toward the hostelry of the jolly miller , before which was gathered , increasing every minute , a compact group , vociferous and full of curiosity .",10
