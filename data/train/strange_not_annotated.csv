"he had not entered the place for more than four years -- not , indeed , since he had used it first as a play- room when he was a child , and then as a study when he grew somewhat older . it was a large , well- proportioned room , which had been specially built by the last lord kelso for the use of the little grandson whom , for his strange likeness to his mother , and also for other reasons , he had always hated and desired to keep at a distance . it appeared to dorian to have but little changed . there was the huge italian cassone , with its fantastically painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings , in which he had so often hidden himself as a boy . there the satinwood book - case filled with his dog - eared schoolbooks . on the wall behind it was hanging the same ragged flemish tapestry where a faded king and queen were playing chess in a garden , while a company of hawkers rode by , carrying hooded birds on their gauntleted wrists . how well he remembered it all ! every moment of his lonely childhood came back to him as he looked round . he recalled the stainless purity of his boyish life , and it seemed horrible to him that it was here the fatal portrait was to be hidden away . how little he had thought , in those dead days , of all that was in store for him !",73
"so that was the story of dorian gray 's parentage . crudely as it had been told to him , it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of a strange , almost modern romance . a beautiful woman risking everything for a mad passion . a few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a hideous , treacherous crime . months of voiceless agony , and then a child born in pain . the mother snatched away by death , the boy left to solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man .",30

"there was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of influence . no other activity was like it . to project one 's soul into some gracious form , and let it tarry there for a moment ; to hear one 's own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of passion and youth ; to convey one 's temperament into another as though it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume : there was a real joy in that -- perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited and vulgar as our own , an age grossly carnal in its pleasures , and grossly common in its aims ....",74
