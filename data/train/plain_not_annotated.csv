"the vast liquid plain , lashed without mercy by the storm , appeared as if covered with herds of furious chargers , whose white and disheveled crests were streaming in the wind .",3
"there , in place of natural wonders , the watery mass offered some thrilling and dreadful scenes to my eyes . in essence , we were then crossing that part of the whole mediterranean so fertile in casualties . from the coast of algiers to the beaches of provence , how many ships have wrecked , how many vessels have vanished ! compared to the vast liquid plains of the pacific , the mediterranean is a mere lake , but it 's an unpredictable lake with fickle waves , today kindly and affectionate to those frail single - masters drifting between a double ultramarine of sky and water , tomorrow bad - tempered and turbulent , agitated by the winds , demolishing the strongest ships beneath sudden waves that smash down with a headlong wallop .",67
"arriving at the topmost ridge of this promontory , i could see vast white plains covered with walruses . these animals were playing among themselves . they were howling not in anger but in glee .",14
"they entered a very plain house , for the door was nothing but silver , and the ceiling was only of beaten gold , but wrought in such elegant taste as to vie with the richest . the antechamber , indeed , was only incrusted with rubies and emeralds ; but the order in which everything was disposed made amends for this great simplicity .",4

"there mr . fogg examined a curious vehicle , a kind of frame on two long beams , a little raised in front like the runners of a sledge , and upon which there was room for five or six persons . a high mast was fixed on the frame , held firmly by metallic lashings , to which was attached a large brigantine sail . this mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist a jib - sail . behind , a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle . it was , in short , a sledge rigged like a sloop . during the winter , when the trains are blocked up by the snow , these sledges make extremely rapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another . provided with more sails than a cutter , and with the wind behind them , they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not superior to that of the express trains .",129

"but at a later period a wide chasm formed diagonally from south - west to north - east , through which was gradually forced out the trachyte which was to form a mountain chain . no violence accompanied this change ; the matter thrown out was in vast quantities , and the liquid material oozing out from the abysses of the earth slowly spread in extensive plains or in hillocky masses . to this period belong the felspar , syenites , and porphyries .",66

"i looked back down the side we had just cleared . there the mountain rose only 700 to 800 feet above the plains ; but on its far slope it crowned the receding bottom of this part of the atlantic by a height twice that . my eyes scanned the distance and took in a vast area lit by intense flashes of light . in essence , this mountain was a volcano . fifty feet below its peak , amid a shower of stones and slag , a wide crater vomited torrents of lava that were dispersed in fiery cascades into the heart of the liquid mass . so situated , this volcano was an immense torch that lit up the lower plains all the way to the horizon .",122
"we stayed in this place an entire hour , contemplating its vast plains in the lava 's glow , which sometimes took on a startling intensity . inner boilings sent quick shivers running through the mountain 's crust . noises from deep underneath , clearly transmitted by the liquid medium , reverberated with majestic amplitude .",12
"just then the moon appeared for an instant through the watery mass , casting a few pale rays over this submerged continent . it was only a fleeting glimmer , but its effect was indescribable . the captain stood up and took one last look at these immense plains ; then his hand signaled me to follow him .",48
