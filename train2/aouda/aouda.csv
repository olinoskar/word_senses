"passepartout , who had been purchasing several dozen mangoes -- a fruit as large as good - sized apples , of a dark - brown colour outside and a bright red within , and whose white pulp , melting in the mouth , affords gourmands a delicious sensation -- was waiting for them on deck . he was only too glad to offer some mangoes to aouda , who thanked him very gracefully for them .","('aouda', 'mrs', 'mistress')",0,66,1

"there was near by what the astronomers would call a disturbing star , which might have produced an agitation in this gentleman 's heart . but no ! the charms of aouda failed to act , to passepartout 's great surprise ; and the disturbances , if they existed , would have been more difficult to calculate than those of uranus which led to the discovery of neptune .","('aouda', 'mrs', 'mistress')",0,31,1
"so reasoned the detective , while the hours crept by all too slowly . he did not know what to do . sometimes he was tempted to tell aouda all ; but he could not doubt how the young woman would receive his confidences . what course should he take ? he thought of pursuing fogg across the vast white plains ; it did not seem impossible that he might overtake him . footsteps were easily printed on the snow ! but soon , under a new sheet , every imprint would be effaced .","('aouda', 'mrs', 'mistress')",1,28,1

"it was seven in the morning when mr . fogg , aouda , and passepartout set foot upon the american continent , if this name can be given to the floating quay upon which they disembarked . these quays , rising and falling with the tide , thus facilitate the loading and unloading of vessels . alongside them were clippers of all sizes , steamers of all nationalities , and the steamboats , with several decks rising one above the other , which ply on the sacramento and its tributaries . there were also heaped up the products of a commerce which extends to mexico , chili , peru , brazil , europe , asia , and all the pacific islands .","('aouda', 'mrs', 'mistress')",1,11,1
