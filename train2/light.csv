"but as the bushes shrank , the tree forms magnified . actual petrified thickets and long alcoves from some fantastic school of architecture kept opening up before our steps . captain nemo entered beneath a dark gallery whose gentle slope took us to a depth of 100 meters . the light from our glass coils produced magical effects at times , lingering on the wrinkled roughness of some natural arch , or some overhang suspended like a chandelier , which our lamps flecked with fiery sparks . amid these shrubs of precious coral , i observed other polyps no less unusual : melita coral , rainbow coral with jointed outgrowths , then a few tufts of genus corallina , some green and others red , actually a type of seaweed encrusted with limestone salts , which , after long disputes , naturalists have finally placed in the vegetable kingdom . but as one intellectual has remarked , "" here , perhaps , is the actual point where life rises humbly out of slumbering stone , but without breaking away from its crude starting point .

"just then the seafloor began to slope sharply downward . the light took on a uniform hue . we reached a depth of 100 meters , by which point we were undergoing a pressure of ten atmospheres . but my diving clothes were built along such lines that i never suffered from this pressure . i felt only a certain tightness in the joints of my fingers , and even this discomfort soon disappeared . as for the exhaustion bound to accompany a two - hour stroll in such unfamiliar trappings -- it was nil . helped by the water , my movements were executed with startling ease .",11,"('light', 'lumière', 'luz')",0

"around the nautilus for a half - mile radius , the waters seemed saturated with electric light . the sandy bottom was clear and bright . dressed in diving suits , crewmen were busy clearing away half - rotted barrels and disemboweled trunks in the midst of the dingy hulks of ships . out of these trunks and kegs spilled ingots of gold and silver , cascades of jewels , pieces of eight . the sand was heaped with them . then , laden with these valuable spoils , the men returned to the nautilus , dropped off their burdens inside , and went to resume this inexhaustible fishing for silver and gold .",16,"('light', 'lumière', 'luz')",0

"i estimate that this cast of the net brought in more than 1,000 pounds of fish . it was a fine catch but not surprising . in essence , these nets stayed in our wake for several hours , incarcerating an entire aquatic world in prisons made of thread . so we were never lacking in provisions of the highest quality , which the nautilus 's speed and the allure of its electric light could continually replenish .",73,"('light', 'lumière', 'luz')",0
"half an hour had already gone by without our situation changing , when our eyes were suddenly spirited from utter darkness into blinding light . our prison lit up all at once ; in other words , it filled with luminescent matter so intense that at first i could n't stand the brightness of it . from its glare and whiteness , i recognized the electric glow that had played around this underwater boat like some magnificent phosphorescent phenomenon . after involuntarily closing my eyes , i reopened them and saw that this luminous force came from a frosted half globe curving out of the cabin 's ceiling .",23,"('light', 'lumière', 'luz')",0
